So far Ive been buying my bitcoins on Coinbase, but I feel their fees are high, and their daily buying limits really low when using a card or Apple Pay. Can someone recommend a better exchange?

Just a discussion point really, I've been hodling a small amount of btc for a long, long time but i recently read lots of UK banks won't accept payments from btc exchanges anymore so it got me thinking, how on earth would I cash out safely?

What's the standard way to cash out these days?
-------------------------------

To be straight to the point, the utilization of cryptocurrencies over different centralized monetary forms gives a few benefits (for illustration, frictionless exchanges and expansion control). Numerous financial specialists join such monetary standards to their wide portfolios as there are certain focal points of cryptocurrency out there indeed.

&amp;#x200B;

The presence of an elective resource like cryptocurrency can combat the endeavors of a government to preserve its possess centrally overseen cash or to control open resources in times of financial troubles. The foremost critical refinement is that they are more secure for citizens to work with and can be utilized for exchanges like buying gold. One of the numerous reasons to go after cryptocurrency is that it dispenses with the middleman when it comes to exchanges  typically a gigantic advantage for financial specialists.

&amp;#x200B;

I look for coins that have real-life use cases. One such coin is #BUY from u/buying_com. They are disrupting billion dollar ecomm business.

&amp;#x200B;

Cryptocurrencies are trustless. Until bitcoin came into presence, any kind of cash required a central specialist you had to believe in arrange to utilize it. This incomparable specialist in all circumstances is the elemental imperfection contributing to the currencys downfall. Each parcel of the arrange approves what the other pieces claim without anyone having to believe. On the off chance that you make a bitcoin exchange, all hubs must get the exchange and confirm whether the marks are redressed or not. When the marks are not appropriate, the contract gets rejected. It is one of the positive impacts of bitcoin.

***Bottom Line Up Front: Can I add other apps outside of my Bitcoin Node software (i.e. Umbrel) on my Raspberry Pi?***

I have been running my own Bitcoin node for a little while now using the Umbrel platform on a 8GB Raspberryi Pi with a 1 TB Solid State Drive (SSD). So far, zero issues and I am very happy.

However, I also know that I am definitely not using the full capabilities of the Raspberryi Pi itself. Is there any way that I can install other apps besides Umbrel on the Raspberry Pi?

To be clear, I know that I can I install apps WITHIN the Umbrel platform. I am talking about adding apps onto the Raspberryi Pi OUTSIDE of the Umbrel platform. In other words, if I cannot add apps onto the Raspberryi Pi OUTSIDE of the Umbrel platform, then it seems like all I can do on the Raspberry Pi is run the Umbrel software and nothing else.

Please let me know your thoughts.

I have my coins on an exchange as I tend to swap them about in parts. So do my peer group. But if we all (Reddit included) removed them from the exchanges then it would be a stronger Hold signal and the price would go up?

As I'm trading way less with BTC now and holding more, I have already moved mine off into a private wallet.

So in what bizaaro world are people living in that they think it is a good idea to spend tens, even hundreds of thousands on what is essentially a fucking picture?  And for what?  I question this and I have to ask myself am I going insane or is the world going insane?  People buying badly drawn pictures of apes for thousands of dollars, lol?  In what world is that ever a good financial decision?

Today I looked at a 'bullish bull' nft picture that is literally a cartoon bull that Gary Vee drew with a black and white marker on an A4 piece of paper, and then it got sold for $70,000usd LMAO? Like what am I missing?  How is any of this sanity?

"Yeah I had enough money to buy a house but check this out, instead I bought this picture of a cartoon bull/cryptopunks avatar/stupid ape/gorilla wearing clothes and a hat.  Check out my picture."

Like what am I missing here?  I look at this NFT shit and I just think, am i going fucking insane?

&gt;According to the reports, the money belonged to a 25-year-old woman from Chicago, who was neither arrested nor charged with a crime after her luggage was seized by police. So why did the police take the money? Well, according to Texas law, police dont need a reason to take your property so long as they believe it either has been part of a crime or they believe it will be involved in a crime. That grants law enforcement sweeping powers to basically seize any property they believe is suspicious, even if they dont have much evidence.  The fact that the K9 identified the bag is, in and of itself, not evidence; [90 percent of cash in circulation](https://www.dickinson.edu/news/article/3193/dickinson_college_chemistry_class_explores_the_presence_of_drug_residue_on_us_currency) has been shown to have trace amounts of cocaine.

Around 10-11 years ago, when BTC was still a novelty, i mined it with my pc (those where the days) for a few weeks. Used to have around 12 of em if i recall correctly. Total value at that time was under ten dollar. I lost interest and did not go to the effort to cash out. Don't recall where the PC went, thought it long lost. When the crypto hype really started kicking of around two years ago, i used to joke to friends how i unwittingly threw away a lot of money. 

Until last week... when we found a few pc's from that era on my grandma's attic. It is very likely that my pc from back then is one of em. Of course... if this BTC is still on that pc... it would be more than worth it to go to great lenghts to recover it.

Problem is, i do not know where to start. I have no idea what software i used for mining, if i used a wallet online or one on the pc... or maybe left it with the pool. Anyone willing to give me some tips on where to start? Most likely i left em in the pool... does that mean it is lost after these years?

Everyone is like: Oh it's just a dip bro, buy the dip! Then we go up 1% and everyone says: "Ha, told you! Bull market is back." Then we go down with another 5% and everyone is like: Buy the dip!

If you believe in the long term of Bitcoin, you should be fine. Personally, I do not think we're in a bear market, but the fact that no one considers it, does scare me.

Especially altcoins can go down 50%, then another 50% and then 50% again, making people lose all their money, while they "buy the dip".

**If** we do get in a bear market now, then it will be a great opportunity to buy cheap. I'm not trying to scare anyone, I'm not saying this is a bear market, but it could be that we don't get a blow-off top this time, no?

Let's suppose you get into a car accident tomorrow and both you and your spouse are dead - have you done any steps to ensure the Bitcoin you hold can be accessed by your kids or loved ones? If yes, what did you do? I'd be curious to know.

As far as I know, there doesn't seem to be a solution to this problem.

In the last 24 hours Tether, the creator of USDT, has minted $1,500,000,000 worth of USDT out of thin air.

Nowhere it is documented where the money which was just created comes from and where it actually went.

Before 2019 Tether claimed 100% of its reserves would be backed by actual cash

Suddenly in April of 2019 Tether claimed only 74% of Tether would be backed by "cash and cash equivalents"

A pie chart (yes, this is how they want to proof their reserves) released by Tether in 2021 revealed that only 2,9% would be backed by cash

How much of it is actually backed of the $1,500,000,000 they somehow created in less than 24 hours? You can probably guess

I'll repeat the thread title, "Is On-Chain analysis largely BS?".  


The analysts are largely articulate and seemingly intelligent but that's not really pertinent if it's just describing the present with no forecasting validity.  


I can describe the present as I'm in the present but so what?

I love Bitcoin but I just have to tune-out the daily YouTube videos from the same people who are enthusiastic about Bitcoin and have a video each day predicting what is going to happen in a few days..."to the Moon" "this is your last chance" etc.  


When they turn out not to be accurate they say that it's just early and that they learned from their mistakes and to join their pay for channel that has more details.  


Everyone insisted that Bitcoin would hit $100k this year even when it was the end of November. Now almost no one is saying that and some are saying maybe it will hit $100k in 2022, if ever...:)

I don't think anything has changed and Bitcoin is still the good deal that it has always been but Technical Analysis really just seems to be navel gazing more than anything else. I'm not saying it's useless for a daily trader but I wouldn't argue if you said it.  


Of course Cathie Woods is sure it will be $568k "someday" or by 2026. It's a lot easier to make predictions and not be held to them when all of your "predictions" are rosy but 4 or 5 years away. I actually like Cathie's general outlook but her fund (ARKK) really only did great in two years and one had mostly to do with Tesla and the other had a lot to do with Bitcoin.  


Nothing that she "predicted" worked out this year. On the other end of the prediction spectrum is Michael Burry. He always predicts that the world is going to end and he was right a decade ago. Yesterday I predicted that my clock would read 12 noon at some point and I was right.

Sometimes I feel really weird because I explain bitcoin to someone and they instantly get it and are basically down to buy some and self custody it immediately. Like it took me **so fucking long** to wrap my head around all of this as far as the implications, energy consumption, the history, the way it functions and it often just feels super weird for me when I expect people to not get it or have questions and they're just like, no I get it, that sounds cool how do I get involved. These are people pretty close to me so I don't **think** that they're just saying they get it when they don't. Anyone else ever feel similarly?

I'm curious if there is any data on how many merchant transactions are done vs how much BTC transactions are new buy-ins/investors, alt coin purchases etc..  I ask because I feel like one of the big hang-ups with BTC as a currency acceptance is its volatility.  How do people rationalize the concept that one day they can use BTC to purchase a coffee or a car but the next day the same item could be 10,15 or 20% more (or less) expensive.   The value of USD, PM commodities, stock markets fluctuate daily, but not with the same exchange rate volatility.

Please help me understand the risk and reward when it comes to mining. Let's assume I am mining BTC and it takes me 1 year to mine 1 BTC. the current value is \~50k. if BTC price were to change to 100k. Does that mean it'll take me twice as long to mine 1 BTC? (2 years?). Also, what if I were to cash out every day or whenever the mining task has been completed. Does that eliminate my risk? I just want to participate in the mining, not speculating. Please help me understand this concept. Be nice.

looking for a little input.i have some bad habits left. ive always been a live within my means kind of guy and that comes with some sacrifice.im a pack a day and 1 energy drink consumer. when i first got into crypto i cut weed out almost entirely. thats been goin pretty good, i dca those funds into btc and eth.my smokes and drink cost is about $15/day. ends up being almost $450 on the month and 5k on the year. i figure spending that 5k on crypto and improving my health is a win-win (im in my mid/late 30s).thinking about a $3/day dca into 5 coins or maybe a $2/day into five projects and $5/day into one with high return potential.looking at some metaverse coins but also other good projects that might see continued price increases through 2022.thinking maybe 2$/day into:avaxdotmaticsandmanafor that 5$/day though im at a bit of a loss. considering gala or something else less than a dollar considering market cap growth potential.any suggestions to consider? i would prefer coins available on coinbase but im open to other suggestions. ideally i wouldnt do anything other than set the scheduled investments and coinbase has that easily available.cutting out smokes will be tough but on the plus side it wont cost me any additional income to start spending those funds elsewhere. i figure dca has to be a better option than what im currently doing with it, literally lighting it on fire and watching it go up in smoke.planning a new years resolution on this but i might start a little early.thanks im advance for any suggestions. been smoking for 12 years, wish me luck. /ENDPOST/ my bank did an all-out interrogation, questioning me on why i am sending money out of my country. what for. who to. how much, when i just wanted to buy some crypto. i also had to fill in a ridiculous amount of information about the receiver. after several forms were filled, i had to talk to one of the banks representatives, and after half an hour i instead ended up just using my credit card with a 4% fee. this just shows how badly we need crypto!i regularly do transfers in both algo and btc. they are seamless, fast, dirt cheap, and no questions asked. i am looking forward to the day i can completely phase out traditional banking, with their pathetic 0,1% apr savings accounts. /ENDPOST/ hey everyone, i'm somewhat new to crypto but have been getting more and more into it every day. so far i've been using coinbase, and kucoin exchanges to buy crypto, and recently have started using some dex like pancakeswap and sushiswap for getting some obscure tokens. i've been wondering about these decentralized exchanges, am i able to take fiat, like usd, and buy usdt, or something similar, directly on them? so far i've been buying usdt using fiat on an exchange, transferring to a wallet that supports dapps, and accessing these dex from there, but due to gas fees i end up losing some on the transfer and wanted a way around that. /ENDPOST/ hello everyone im still learning about crypto (not that i think it ever ends) and i have a quest im hoping i can get help with since ive noticed how amazing this community is.i want to send bnb from my tw to binance and change it to busd.but i notice there is bep20 and bep2  im fairly certain i need the bep20 because its a bsc and what i need it for is a smart contract.now heres where im confused binance dont have a busd wallet on spot. it says it will go to fund will this make a difference? and do i need to pay for gas fees? /ENDPOST/ i am a crypto newb but i'm amazed by the potential even stable coins have, i'm also a new father and really want a better future for my son. that said i used to drink alot and eat alot of takeaways etc, always semi skint and feeling like i'll never get anywhere financially.i now quietly siphon that spare booze money that ive been wasting for over 10 years (better learnt late then never!) into a crypto wallet.... my mental health is improving , i've lost abit of weight. i feel much more positive about the future. this is my first post i've been lurking but thanks for the info and the community. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ with the closing of the binance bridge i was wondering how people where swapping tokens between blockchains. i found myself investing in a bunch of stuff that i just found interesting without really factoring in how they interacted in any ecosystem. maybe thats healthy to diversify across multiple blockchains but i was also thinking about how i could consolidate as im into 20 coins.ive heard of a few options like celer and hashbon rocket and i think bridging everything is kind of what cosmos is doing but i dont understand the tech that well. so i ask you all what have you all been using? do these bridging projects have their own tokens that you need to have to operate the bridge? /ENDPOST/ back in the 2017 bull run i purchased some crypto kitties. after ethereum gas fees went up i coulnd't really use them to reproduce and sold them. i came out about break even. now years later their value hasn't kept up with the rest of the market. so i'm glad i sold back then, even if the cats has super cute eyes and tails.what went wrong? why are other nfts going  up more? will they suffer the same fate as crypto kitties? i'd like to get others perspectives, particularly those who are in the nft space and have been for a few years now. thanks! /ENDPOST/ i am very new to defi. i am trying to learn about bitcoin (btc). but i still do not understand. so may i ask here? i learned that total amount of bitcoin is limited to btc21m. now btc18.77m was already mined. and around btc2.2m is  left to be discovered. all btc21m will be discovered in 2140 a.d. back to my question. who creates new blocks for the remaining btc2.2m? or it creates itself automatically? i am pretty sure that there are no running programs or bots generating new blocks of btc. and satoshi is irrelevant in this case. i am really confused. please point me out. thank you, /ENDPOST/ i want to give my niece and nephew unique christmas gifts, that aren't just items that will be used once. so over the last few years i've been a male role model in my niece and nephews lives and try to contribute to their future with education. my nephew and niece are 4 / 12.i've taught my nephew about coding/programming, soldering, building a raspberry pi, tech, and recently crypto before gifting him crypto. so far i've had my nephew watch videos on what a cryptocurrency is, what's a blockchain, soon bot trading and more web 3.0, charts, etc. my niece gets curious and will learn with my nephew.my niece and nephew live with their grandmother and i was going to create a wallet/exchange account under her information, mostly for tax purposes. (she's on board with the idea and implementation). im not sure if i should convert to a high apy and stake for my niece.other that purchasing some xlm at a recent low, and thinking that i should create a metamask wallet, i am not sure what steps i should consider for my niece and nephew. i have some time before christmas to consider what to do.i'm not sure if i should allow my nephew to trade or just stake for him. if i were to allow him to take the reigns and trade then it wouldn't be a concern if he just learned and lost because a future bday gift could be some stablecoin. their grandmother and i do plan on keeping track of things by maintaining access to wallet, exchange, etc untill they both have a way of getting fiat/ purchasing things with crypto/ creating their own wallets.i'm open to ideas and information about crpyo to start them with, what wallet to use, legalities of minors in crpyto in the us, what to teach them, etc /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ i keep reading about this project and i keep wondering why theres no hype around it! theres a partnership with facebooks meta ai, you have the winklesvoss twins invested in it, they put security and privacy first (which in eu context would be more compliant than other projects maybe?), and all in all it seems really promising. do you think such a new layer one still has time to grow in this bull cycles, similarly to solana? id love to hear your take on it, as i have many friends who are invested in crypto but not one mentioned rose. one other interesting pick in the same direction would be ocean protocol, and thats an even more unpopular choice. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ blockfi: ok team, we've been slowly reducing interest rates now to abysmal levels. what's next on the agenda?also blockfi: well, why don't we increase withdrawal fees to 0.15eth on eth/erc withdrawals?blockfi: great idea. what about cybermonday? naturally we have to give back to the people after we've tanked the rates on everything.also blockfi: .....\*crickets\*..... we.. we could sell overpriced merch but say its for a limited 'cyber-monday' deal?blockfi: excellent! keep up the great work.&amp;#x200b;this is how i imagine board-room meetigns go over at blockfi. not even a much needed promo deal. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ as titled.... in hopes of using flooz trade to swap bnb for another token, i sent bnb(bep20) to a bitpay eth-linked wallet. i don't see the funds in my bitpay wallet interface, but in  flooz, i see the bnb balance. i am unable to interact with the bnb in flooz at all. when i attempt to swap, the flooz interface simply says: "switch to bsc, this token is only tradable on the bsc network". it won't switch to bsc when i click the button. are these coins lost forever?any requests for dm will be ignored. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ while bitcoin and ethereum continue to struggle this week, metaverse coins continue to dominate the market. here are 5 metaverse coins gaining the most price this week5. redfox labs (rfox)  $0.32 (+82.6%)the rfox token will power the entire rfox ecosystem and act as a form of payment. rfox will also be used as trading fees to develop liquidity.while vfox provides holders with a stake in the metaverse, the rfox token will be the main currency on the platform.4. arcona (arcona)  $1.44 (+84.8%)arcona claims to be the worlds first operator to provide worldwide augmented reality cloud access. its building the x-reality metaverse, looking to merge the real and virtual worlds.arcona features an augmented reality app for ios that users can check out today. in addition, arcona enables participants to earn profit by starting a business in their metaverse.3. spheroid universe (sph)  $0.15 (+95.8%)spheroid universe is a platform for developing artificial reality and extended reality applications. it features the spheroid xr cloud and the spheroid script programming language designed for metaverse projects.the spheroid universe consists of virtual spaces; each space accumulates value similar to a social media account. however, unlike traditional social media accounts, the virtual spaces belong to the user since the platform uses defi and blockchain technology.2. realm (realm)  $1.70 (+172.5%)realm features a play-to-earn 3d metaverse, ar environment, and an nft collection. users can earn realm tokens for exploring and mastering various realms and viewing immersive art and exhibitions.realms 3d metaverse is exceptionally similar to decentraland and the sandbox. the unique aspect of realm is its open-source metaverse and its focus on creating highly personalized experiences.1. neos credits (ncr)  $4.54 (+248.8%)neos is a virtual reality metaverse looking to generalize the way social experience and virtual creations are built. neos is looking to its in-verse economy as a way for content creators and service providers to make a living in neos.neos credits is the erc-20 token native to the platform and allows for an independent economy and value transfer between users. neos has a fully working app that users can download to check out the neos metaverse. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ these are simply events in my life that have lead me to investing. read on, if you happen to give a fuck.im in my mid twenties and have felt that ive never achieved any aspect of success in my life. i obtained average grades during my academic life and have never made any significant achievements. ive been told time and time again that ill never amount to anything by teachers, haters and potential employers. i have struggled with mental health issues for as long as i can remember and while there are some days that i can breathe normally, other days get very difficult and depressing and i literally feel like giving up.even after i finished academics, i watched as all of my friends obtained fantastic jobs. me? i was rejected from over 50 interviews within 12 months. infact, once i was rejected from a job as this role pays x per annum and you are not worth x. the worst thing is as my failures mounted, i slowly and slowly began to lose hope and started to believe that maybe, just maybe i wasnt cut out for the success that i had dreamed of as a little boy.i finally obtained a dead-end job in a company that i only got because someone i had known for 2 weeks referred me to the company, basically guaranteeing me a spot. im an ethnic minority and said company has exhibited racial and discriminative behaviour, time and time again. two years went by and i never received any promotion, pay rise or anything else of the sort.after so many failed interviews, promotion offers etc, i applied for one final promotion. once again, i faced rejection. but this time something wasnt right. the interview was meant to start at 11am and finish at 12pm. however, i was not given the promotion as the interview finished 10 minutes late because of you and therefore you must work on your time management skills. but do you know what little detail they left out? **they** started that interview 10 minutes late. yes, they started at 11:10am and finished at 12:10pm. to add insult to injury, they promoted someone who had joined the company two months prior.i went home that night and evaluated everything that i had been through. why is it that everything i touched lead to failure and disappointment? i was fed up with being average all my life and that day, i decided to make a change. i was done with people telling me my worth - because i always knew i was better than that. and then, i discovered a platform that would allow me to prove my worth and not rely on anyone else: the financial markets. i took most of what i had saved up from working those two years at this garbage company and threw it into the financial markets. i had somewhat been following the markets before but never built up enough courage to start.let me tell you, that was the best decision i ever made. while ive still got a long way to go, i have made so much more than that promotion ever would have paid me. more importantly, i feel like ive ignited a spark within me that i never knew existed and finally, i see light at the end of the tunnel.i hope this story is a firm reminder to everyone going through similar struggles that i went through that its not over until you give up. financial markets are an incredibly powerful tool; not because of the potential gains you can make from yoloing your life savings on the next dogecumelon shitcoin, but because this is our chance to fight back against every naysayer out there. a chance to escape the rat race that this corrupt system keeps us in because no - we arent falling into the same trap of working a job we hate until we retire. this is our chance to silence every single bit of doubt that we may have held against ourselves because of past experiences or words that someone else has said.sometimes in life, we must face rejection in order to move forward. im forever grateful for my struggles in life and for **that** interview as had i not been rejected in such an unfair manner, i would have never realised my true worth.i especially admire crypto as it is essentially a huge fuck you to this corrupt system that we live in. ladies and gentlemen, we have so many financial institutions on their knees right now due to the huge dent blockchain technology has made within traditional financial services. no dip - no matter how big - is ever going to stop us from achieving success and becoming a slave to the system once again. together, we will obtain financial freedom and that is my promise to every single one of you. /ENDPOST/ just as the title says; what's your worst crypto scam experience. it's rear to go a whole week on reddit without seeing a "i was scammed" or "don't be like me post" where people lose a whole lot of money on various kinda scams. somedays back i saw the post of a guy who lost 200k usdt, yesterday i also saw the news of the guy who committed suicide after being a victim of a rugpull.i'm not gonna lie, it scares me especially as a newbie here seeing these posts regularly. i know some rules to stay out of scams like "if a hot girl send you a pm telling you about crypto; block him cos he got balls bigger than yours lol" but at the same time i still feel like i'm not so safe.so i'd like to hear from others what their experiences has been like. maybe me or anyone else could learn a thing or two from there and it could save someone's ass.. so tell us if you have any /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ aight 3-6 months ago i invested in crypto (ish 100dollars) and i successfully got a 130% return in a month by day trading and buying new listed cryptos. but then for some reason i stopped and chose to put all the money in the conventional stock market... but after i saw shiba blow i thought to my self "maybe i should put some money (100$) in shiba while it's in its peak and hold", i've now lost 57$..my plan---&gt; i've got ish 1200$ in the stock market. take out all that money and put everything on crypto and stick to my old trading strategies.i've now goten criticized from family and friends saying it's not safe, but from what i've learned in trading crypto in one month and reading about it for over a year i feel safe putting a large amounts of money into the crypto marketnow the problem is... should i wait for the next crypto/bitcoin crash ? because of the state the crypto market is now, i don't feel like it's the time, but perhaps now is the end of the beginning? help! /ENDPOST/ i am looking for a app that will notify me of specifically selected currencies when their price goes up or down. i don't necessarily want to select what price it has to hit for me to be notified just when there's a decent dip to buy in at.lets say an alt coin for instance is up at $5 and i want to buy in on any dip so the app will notify me if hits 4.80 or something. just something on the more simple end to help myself with buying and selling.does any one have anything that could be what i'm looking for?thanks. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ hi, its time for another update!at this point in time the hype is fading away and things are settling down.for starters, the chivo app still have problems doing transactions (tx) to external wallets like muun or coinomi. tx between chivo wallets are fine, although they use a btc l1 qr code, the transactions are instant and without any issue, so its logic to assume chivo doesnt use the btc blockchain at all.i personally think chivo app is becoming something similar to a bank app, you can send and receive money, it has 0 fees between the same app, you contact customer support for any issues, and its a pain in the ass to make transaction to other banks (external wallets)many of you might say this is just the beginning and that things will changeand youre probably right, i also hope the development of btc as currency take a step forward.moreover, i imagine what many of you are thinking, *why do you need to use chivo? just use another wallet.*yes, i can use other ln wallets, however the main issue is the fee, a $0.50 coke can become $1.50, all of you already know how fees work. so, by using chivo app you omit paying fees and the transaction is instantthe most used wallets aside chivo are muun and wallet of satoshi, only on the beach and nearby places you might find bitcoin beach wallet. many people asked me about strike, but no one really use it, it requires your id to register aside other personal information, you also cant send less than $5 soits not a wallet for daily use.some people also asked about the implementation of other crypto currencies, there are some interesting projects like nano but as long the coin doesnt show any advantage in a daily use i find it harder to succeed.\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------probably the big news as for today is bitcoin city, since i dont have more information than what bukele explain ill only share what people is sayingas always, there are many who thinks this will help develop the country attracting investors and foreigners, i think this is true. on the other hand, theres also people who claim the country need investment in areas like education, security and so on rather than building btc city which probably only benefit a small group of peoplei also think this is true.el salvador needs to improve in many ways, government needs to plan in short and long term. theres no good or wrong answer at the moment, after all you do what you can and what you think will bring the best outcome.fun fact, the image of bitcoin city is actually a stock image with a volcano over itthis became trendy in social media days ago.probably the most eye-catching feature is the tax exemption, bitcoin city seems to be a haven for local and foreign investors, i personally think salvadoran government is saying i dont care how you get the bitcoinjust come.*will btc city became a crypto version of las vegas? what are your thoughts?* leave your comments below!\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------therere also some people who asked me about land and the safest locations in my country, its hard to answer in detail to everyone so i will create a post around friday titled**almost everything you need to know to buy land in el salvador and not dying (literally) in the process**with such a catchy title it will be difficult to miss it.i will try to summarize the most relevant information about my country geography and social context. there are many misconceptions about how dangerous el salvador is. ill also give you some insights about real state, i wonder if anyone is interested where btc city will be built.as always, ill try to answer all your questions. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ basically the tl:dr is that marine biologists have discovered a new marine species and is giving us the opportunity to name this species. i proposed "xyloplax wagmiscus" and it actually made it to the top 3 :owagmi is a universal term in the nft/crypto space and would be sooo damn cool if we could leave a mark as a community! here's the poll. so far, the word wagmiscus is losing, but we have the potential to turn the tide around!i mean how cool would it be to see wagmi in official scientific papers??

gold sucks, bitcoin is the future - especially with 21 million max coins, increasing utility, and mass adoption.in general, this industry hasn't even gotten started. it's like the internet in 1992 or maybe 2002 - but bigger. apple, tesla, amazon - those aren't even relevant comparisons for where we're heading.... the gdp of the us is $21 trillion; china is $15 trillion; japan is $5 trillion; the uk is $3 trillion. crypto will be a significant portion of the world economy - bigger than entire countries - especially 5, 10, and 20 years from now.my plan for the next 2 years is to diversify big time, then reassess. diversify between defi, gaming, non-ethereum layer 1, bitcoin, ethereum. i'm expecting some of them to plunge, but i think at least 5 of them that i choose will 50-100x in the next 2 years.gotta keep an open mind, not act on impulse, and never invest more than i can afford to lose. /ENDPOST/ celebrate green dildos my diamond handed friends. fudsters lose. always buy the dip.when moon when lamboin the ledger who will holdbuy the f\*cking dip# the night satoshi sold## by [elle jacques-pierre](https://twitter.com/ellejacquesp)*truthfully* it took conviction, putting faith in meta fiction, all night waiting, anticipating death cross prophecies foretold. manning then my battlestation, browsing tabs of information, suddenly a small vibration, coming from my phone in gold. unknown caller, cant be bothered, i silenced my phone in gold. privacy my right to hold.in laser eyes peripheral, i noticed something visceral, alarms flashing, charts were crashing  knives falling on bitcoins of gold. checking out the price per token, reading rumors harshly spoken, rumors of a system broken, of our founder dumping gold. could it be a trick by odin  the zero block dumping gold?

assets such as ohm and time defy btc and seem to make out a profit during dips, often counteracting price action entirely.if everyone is scared of a bear market, people get scared and are more reluctant to invest when it might all come crashing down. and the harder it dumps, more people sell. but what if this is only sentiment causing dips? what if people stopped believing in the possibility of a bear market, what would happen then? /ENDPOST/ *original post removed, reposted with new flair and added perspective*what do you think the attitude of gen z kids will be towards crypto when they grow up?

will it just be regarded with the attitude of a meme? what do you think? i am genuinely interested. /ENDPOST/ remember that blockchain engeneer reddit hired recently to work on the community points tokens project?well, he's been asking some interesting questions on twitter recently.i quote:"want to do some research in those protocols where governance tokens actually get a portion of revenue directly. i know@makerdaois one. any others?"source:https://twitter.com/iamrahul20x/status/1463657579121369094?t=tjiv1_iwyzvkdd1ze9552a&amp;s=19i speculate, they might be looking into a way to share the ad revenue with us, governance tokens holders.thoughts?

a hardware wallet.i was wondering if i could receive advice on comparing my current (or any other) options in terms of a ledger nano s or trezor one (needs to be under $80).i am leaning to the ledger as ledger live seems to support most of the coins i'm keen on regularlying buying and staking (btc, eth, matic and cosmos) while i can use metamask for other nfts and random punts at future projects. i can see the nano s can support 3 'apps'; i assume ledger live and metamask would could as 2 apps (unless each coin i listed needs to have it's own 'app' which is quite useless!)any 'cheap' way to transfer my coins from the exchange to my wallet to exchange would also be helpful, i was thinking of converting it all to usdc or dai and then moving it across to re-exchange within ledger live?so, any pros and cons, or advice before i commit would be fantastic!&amp;#x200b;thanks! /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ i've been thinking about this a lot since getting into crypto.i know there's debate about btc being a store of value (sov) vs. a medium of exchange (moe) but in the united states, for law abiding citizens anyway, are we really supposed to track any time we buy something small with btc? or exchange it for something? or give it to a friend?and then declare that on our taxes? and owe taxes if we made a profit on that sale?to me, this feels like one of the biggest hurdles to wider adoption of using btc as a moe. even while more and more companies are accepting crypto as payment for goods and services.(personally, i'm a hodler so i'm not planning on selling my btc anyway or using it in that way anytime soon lol. but i'm just trying to understand how that would even work and why anyone would use it that way.)what are y'all's thoughts on this?**tl;dr - like the title says, if selling or exchanging btc is a taxable event in your country, why would anyone use it as a medium of exchange?** /ENDPOST/ i'm pretty much brand new to crypto, so i'd like to find out what your viewpoints are.given the current state of things, it seems like a terrible turn of events is about as likely as it has ever been in the past. so, lets say that an economic disaster rears its ugly head and brings the stock market to its knees. we're black tuesday levels decline. 50% losses in a month.if this happens in the stock market, do you believe the crypto market will collapse too?if so, to what degree?what coins do you feel are safest from going to $0? i'm more looking for coins that aren't btc or eth.thank you for your insights. /ENDPOST/ so bitboy

soon. on the other hand, george gives us more realistic view on that and says it could possibly solve sometime in 2022 as eos &amp; kin took approx. two years to solve. as you know, most promised eos back then &amp; kin are not doing well. do you think this is like a curse on xrp that it will follow the path of eos or would you say that traditional bankings are going to use xrp that it will

most discussions for your everyday crypto investor are around the coins themselves, which is warranted given this is a market that recently hit $3 trillion in early november, with the price of one bitcoin reaching $67,000. however, it is peculiar, that so often we talk about these coins, and rarely do we talk about the broader crypto landscape. what if we took a step back and thought about the cryptocurrency ecosystem and the entirety of its value chain  not just the coins themselves? this is the lens i look at this market through and it is why i am so bullish (and long) on gex management (otc: gxxm).**the real winners  the investors that understand the value of the pick &amp; shovel plays**the concept of pick and shovel investing derived from the 1800s gold rush. the discovery of gold in a locale triggered a frenetic scramble of miners who dreamed of great fortunes. unfortunately, mining led to disappointment for most miners.a few of the smarter, more business savvy individuals decided they could enjoy the sudden industry shift and immense tailwinds that came with the gold rush without the direct exposure:&amp;#x200b;* dont      dig for gold, sell shovels to the miners running for the hills.* the      secret to getting rich in a gold rush is selling picks.during the california rush, mark hopkins, piled up a $25,000,000 fortune selling picks to miners running for the hills hoping to strike gold.today, the modern day gold rush is the cryptocurrency rush. in 2021, we have the powerful tool of technology, and the flexibility / scalability that it brings creates a plethora of modern day picks and shovels that sophisticated institutions and retail investors alike should be evaluating. im choosing to not be the miners, but rather the mark hopkins, william drurys, and levi strauss during the rise of cryptocurrency era.during the 1849 gold rush, those who made the most money sold picks and shovels to miners - green bay press-gazette.**gex management (otc: gxxm)

than $10,000 in cryptocurrency will have to report their transactions to the internal revenue service (irs) under the proposaltoday, tracking profits across multiple wallets and exchanges is difficult and may create future issues as reporting ramps up. per shehan chandrasekera, a cpa and head of tax strategy at crypto tax software company cointrack.io *one of the biggest challenges for cryptocurrency investors is tracking gains and losses, said shehan chandrasekera (cnbc article). thats because many exchanges wont send form 1099-b detailing annual proceeds, forcing investors to calculate annual profits or losses on their own.***valuation:** trading at a discount to other cryptocurrency pick and shovel players with a similar early mover advantage**platform:** strong

decided to make this non educational post on reddit .friendly wager ? dinner for anyone in ny area . etc. i am willing to bet that btc hits 15k before 100kenjoy your day :) /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ last week, black friday hit stores and e-commerce websites worldwide. and while people all over the world scurried to get their hands on cut-price goods and services, bitcoin offered a black friday deal of its own, dropping by $5,000 to give traders and investors a juicy buying opportunity right on cue. however, analysts were quick to point out the unusual nature of the drop; the bitcoin price has an inverse correlation with the dollar but last week, btc followed the usd downwards.on a positive note, btc price action seems to have steadied owing to strong buying support at the $53,000 mark, an area that corresponds to the $1 trillion market capitalization. regarding the black friday drop, history repeated itself; in november 2020, btc dipped to around $16,400 before igniting a historic rally in the ensuing months. could we see that this year as well? /ENDPOST/ major crypto exchange binance has announced that dogecoin (doge) withdrawals are fully possible again. users were unable to withdraw doge for 17 days."you may have heard the news already, thanks to some friends on twitter. hi elon. hey cz," the announcement read, alluding to the conversation between the two ceos.last week, tesla and spacex ceo elon musk accused binance of not being transparent with its doge customers and called the situation "shady," which led to a debate with binance ceo changpeng zhao (cz).earlier, on november 11, binance announced that withdrawals from the doge network would be "suspended for the next 10 to 14 days" due to an issue that occurred after an update. binance shared more details about the issue, saying that "a combination of unlikely factors led to an unforeseen problem that ultimately only affected binance."the exchange stated that only platforms that had doge 2019 version 1.14.0 listed, had transactions stuck in the wallet, upgraded their wallet to version 1.14.2, and then to version 1.14.5 were affected by the issue - emphasizing that these are the facts, "no shading intended."the team noted that they had resumed doge disbursements on saturday, november 27, and everything was being "quietly" tested to ensure there were no further problems.in an earlier update, cz said that "meme coins and those who support them are an important part of the crypto ecosystem."source. crypto-news /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ hi everyone! im curious to know if there is a website that has basic information on crypto currencies in a .csv format (or easy visuals in table format) to basically see the country of origin of the coin (i.e. development), launch date, market cap, trading volume, total circulation, etc. i tried searching around but didnt quite see anything like this. i know some exchanges have extensive lists, but they are not in table format and its difficult to search by clicking on each coin. if anyone has any sites to check out, that would be great. thank you! /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ never mind

trading venue six digital exchange (sdx) is contemplating, after a seemingly interminable wait for licenses from swiss markets regulator finma.convergence between the new cryptocurrency world and traditional finance isnt exemplified anywhere better than sdx, whose parent company is six group, the operator of the swiss national stock exchange.in the short term, theres a pipeline of tokenization products that can be launched relatively quickly, zeeb said, including some interesting new listings in the equities space, targeted at digital-savvy investors looking to benefit from the liquidity and price discovery associated with being on a full exchange.weve got a lot of private market stuff that wouldnt have the liquidity, zeeb said. so, its promissory notes; its art funds, that, as you would expect at the moment, has the whole nft piece as well.while zeeb wishes things could move forward a little quicker, he accepts swiss time is relatively fast in comparison to other countries crypto roadmaps.probably not many swiss people would agree with this, zeeb said, but we have the benefit of having a fairly enlightened government that said pretty early on, we need to have a digital strategy. and its a small country. so, you can define the requirements and then let the commercial guys run with it. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ you can see the data here at

experience to draw on.according to kusama, the finished game will be licensed exclusively for use on shibarium. shibarium is the second-layer blockchain of shiba inu.but that's not all, shiba inu is also well prepared to enter the metaverse."*however, i believe that a "metaverse" needs to be more than a bent infinity symbol and a way to extract data. it needs to provide real value to users. to do that, there needs to be a certain foundation that is created before the technology is released*", kusama explains. the "bent infinity symbol" is, of course, a reference to mark zuckerberg's vision and the importance facebook is expected to play in the metaverse. kusama contrasts this with the shiba inu variant of the metaverse called oshiverse. the shiba inu development team is working at full

manipulating the market anytime a trade hasnt gone our way. but this isnt intended to be a rant post. im going to make a reasoned argument about why this mindset is extremely detrimental to your success as a trader/investor, without saying manipulation isnt real. ill try to explain that even though im willing to stipulate to the claim that manipulation probably does occur, its not whats ruining your trades on a regular basis.the number one reason that manipulation should not be in your toolkit of rationalization techniques is this: its unfalsifiable. in other words, youre choosing to take an approach to trading that places you in the category of always right. every single thing you identify as a gem really is a gem, and the only way it can go is up. if it isnt or it doesnt, it was manipulated. every trade setup you identify is a good setup, and if it doesnt work out it was manipulated. there are two logical conclusion to this approach.the first is that if you are already inclined to deny responsibility for your own decisions, it probably means you also ignore a lot of vital information prior to making those decisions if its not what you want to hear. and your refusal to accept being wrong probably means that you hold onto losses way past the point that you should have cut them. because you cant be invalidated, you hold your losing trades into the ground.the second is that you will never gain the knowledge and experience necessary to become a better investor because you think you are already perfectthey just arent letting you reap the rewards of your genius.okay so, thinking this way is cancer to your portfolio. i cant tell you the number of times ive seen people accuse them of manipulating an asset that i could have told them weeks prior was showing red flags. and they could have known that too, but they had found a gem, so.on the pumping side, spending just a little bit of time and effort learning about extremely basic market indicators can save you from most garbage purchases. rsi (primarily being able to identify critically overbought readings), support/resistance, breakout patterns, fear and greed indexwithout too much energy you can pretty consistently predict if something is about to run out of steam. in other words, how is it manipulation when i can tell you the dump is coming? when youve likely heard warnings from other traders?for example, i have a family member who bought shiba early enough to get like a 3x. and only once it had done that and was going parabolic did they start shilling it to the family. they were like wow i need to look into that. i felt obligated to warn everyone it was grossly overextended and that the time to buy had passedalso urged the first relative to take profits. he was like nah, do some research on this one man ;). following week, shiba is down 50%. been in a downtrend ever since. predictably, this relative attributes the dump to manipulation. like, i said it would happenand its not a brag, its not hard to do. figuring out what/when not to buy is fairly simple relative to figuring out what/when to buy. and the faster something pumps the more confident you can be that its about to get manipulated.speaking of what/when to buy, lets talk about when something isnt pumping or has never pumped at all. if you identify one of these as a moonshot and it doesnt happen, it doesnt mean it was manipulated. there are a lot of reasons things dont get traction. bad marketing, trash tokenomics, sell pressure from staking rewards. but probably most of all, this market is just driven by narratives. for example, if you were ahead of defi, metaverse/gaming, nft marketplaces, layer 1s, dog coins, your bags are getting literally all of the attention this cycle, at least  they did at some point. does that mean everything else is manipulated? nah, it just means it isnt hot right now or never was. notice i dont distinguish between good projects and bad projects. bad projects pump all the time, if theyre in-narrative.as a final message: if you really believed the market was substantially rigged against you, it would be irrational to participate, right? so assuming youre not that dissonant, the reasoning here is that youre simply too greedy to know when youve won (so you lose), or youre so averse to losing that you have to blame someone else. no matter which way youre losing, attributing it to manipulation is doing you zero favors. and given that youre playing at all its unlikely that you fully believe it anyway.approach this market as though its the oppositetheres no manipulation (even if there might be) and your results will dramatically improve. because youll be forced to learn other theories about why the market moves the way it doestheories you can actually apply. theories that can actually yield falsifiable predictions. and when your predictions can be invalidatedwhen you can be wrongyou will actually start getting better as a trader by leaps and bounds.cheers /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ our client is a bold new game studio with a mission to build cutting-edge aaa entertainment for the 21st century. the founders are

kucoin would not permit me.this is patently illegal. when you short-you borrow the asset from another person, not the exchange! here kucoin is interfering with both of their client's trades, (the short seller and the coin lender).**so in effect, kucoin has stolen \~$32,000. from me, and will not give it back.**when i went to cover this short yesterday in profit as intended, it would not take my cover order.

however, there are elements of story-telling and world-building that require quasi-dictatorial (or even godlike) control, at least in part. am i even using "semi-decentralized" in a logical or understandable fashion, or is this ruining the concept, or is it even possible?cryptocurrency - rose-gold (rau): in norse mythology, odin is gifted "draupnir," which is a gold ring (or armband) that drips 8 new and identical rings every 9th night. in my world of frostheim, it is a rose-gold armband that loki devises to consume and destroy the realms of yggdrasil via infinite propagation. it is valued because of its properties, beauty, and artificial scarcity, for the original "gift of loki" is maintained by the rose-goldsmiths of the queendom of koralia. in this way, users who are citizens of koralia and are nominated by the community into the position of rose-goldsmiths would ultimately decide not on the creation of rau but rather on its destruction. is this crazy, stupid, impossible? would a "semi-decentralized" (or, rather, "semi-centralized") author create too much fear, uncertainty, or distrust? would the community--or could a story-teller--trust a handful of rose-goldsmiths to regulate possible exponential growth in rau?&amp;#x200b;i have so many questions and appreciate anyone who read any amount of this. i will be adding more content to my profile in case anyone is interested in the world of frostheim. my map will be one of the nfts that i make available eventually to raise funds. if you are interested in helping, joining, consulting, or anything else, please reach out!&amp;#x200b;tl;dr: you are awesome! /ENDPOST/ i'm seriously considering closing my little soap business. it's nice to get a little check every month but my supplies just never go down in price. i also have stock made that has not sold that i will probably end up donating to the local food bank.it's fun but costly and i think that i would be better off making crypto investments. i'm going to have to up my commitment to research and study with all the crazy crypto flooding the market and mudding up the waters.i'm 67 and banks don't make sense to me anymore. i don't have a problem with self directed investments in stock, but the crypto market is getting crowded.oh well, time to adjust /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ what are everyones thought on vgx and the 9% annual rewards debit mastercard? are you getting it? any reasons youre skeptical?((for anybody who doesnt know, the voyager exchange has offered a no annual fee, 9% cash back debit card linked to usdc in your account))vgx is still relatively small too, with just over a $1b market cap. i see a lot of room for growth with the adoption of the card and the amount of people it will bring over to the exchange, considering the next closest similar card i can think of off the top of my head is the coinbase card with almost half the annual rewards. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ our client is a unique emerging quantitative crypto hedge fund with aum in the top 10% of crypto hedge funds;

(i didn't know that term at that point) a friend of mine talked me into buying ada and after some research, i thought this was a reasonable idea. so i put a small amount into it. after a few days not really caring about my investment, i checked my balance and lo and behold: ada was acting like a stable coin (another term i did not know about at that point) but i was promised fast &amp; easy money. (i won't lie: i just want some quick cash)at this point, i decided to look around for a more adventurous option. i sold my ada and redistributed my crypto funds into chz which was pumping at that very moment. little did i know about pump &amp; dumps at that point but i was intrepid.a few hours later, i checked my portfolio and i was up 50% and felt smarter than warren buffett. high on dopamine i put even more fiat into chz and again after a few hours, i more than doubled all of my investments.now comes the really clever (in hindsight) move: i cashed out my initial investments plus some profits. i left the remaining tether on the exchange to earn more. at this point i was like "ten more of those runs and i never have to work again" and started to really dig into everything crypto. i read articles, books - watched videos, followed people on twitter and got a good feeling for the market.this was the tipping point - from here i started to become cautious - i've read about people selling on the top of the pump and losing lots of money. i don't wanted to be that guy that falls for scams, rug pulls, shit-coins etc...so i invested in projects that have an actual purpose but only got very moderate gains. i became reasonable on my investments but remained impatient. i was looking down to all people investing into meme coins, thinking what they are doing is dumb af.so i started looking into futures. (lol) long story short: i lost all of the remaining profits and called it quits on crypto. fast forward to the last weekend. i had some spare fiat and invested it into qi for no particular reason, other than it being a new listing on binance and having a low mcap. after a few days it had a 100% run again. i sold at the top and called it a day. now the same thing happened - i started to do research again and became more cautious. i figured rose would be a good investment... well - today i cashed out everything after losing half of my profits...if i would have investment in some stupid dedicated gaming coin like alice, i would be better off (in the short term). i mean - the game is probably shit from the looks of it.now i have come to the conclusion that i have to embrace the chaotic nature of crypto if you want fast and easy money. it's kind of a gamble at that point but for every reasonable decision you have to also factor in people with large followers spreading rumors/shilling which then turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy. you have to take risks by buying into meme coins. all those people that don't care about the purpose of the coin they are buying - they are also part of the market and for every ta you are doing, you should also look at the current flavor of the day.also: check twitter for major announcements and act immediately.so on my personal reminder it reads:\- follow the hype\- take profits every once in a while\- don't be too cautious\- follow projects on twitter and watch out for news and announcements\- people that are not doing their own research are also part of the market - make use of it /ENDPOST/ so, i have some questions regarding this strategy which i feel i put at reasonably safe parameters.1. lets say a black swan event happens, ust de-pegs all the way down to 79 cents and i get liquidated (never gone that low before but i of course know anything is possible) i would be left with my roughly 18,000 mim minus their 5% liquidation fee (1000) so about 17,000 mim correct?2. what happens to that 48,700 mim in the event of liquidation if i have it invested somewhere else?3. just to clarify my 20,000 does not turn into 48,700 mim after one year right? thats just the amount i can borrow? my 20,000 turns into roughly 31,200 (56%)?4. when i want to cash out from this what do i give back and what do i get? give back the 48,700 mim and i then have 31,200 ust? (1 year)i'm not a full degen yet but trying to learn so bear with me here on my basic questions.from what i can tell it would be best using that 48,700 mim to swap for ust and then stake on anchor for added return no? giving me roughly another 10,000 turning my 20,000 into about 41,000 after 1 year (best being safe while leveraged no?)anyways let me know if i am completely off

/ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ i joined crypto in 2017, made massive unrealized gains, failed to sell, and that was a major blow to my mental state for many years. still bothers me sometimes but i'm beginning to move on.so, now in 2021, the market is much higher than when i first joined, and even higher than late 2017, early 2018.i'm wondering if you believe that there is still the opportunity for high risk/high reward gains like we saw then.i feel there is. but a big crash is coming. and it will go back up after that but it will be a multi-year process from investment to gain.i'm currently looking at coins again for those instant 10x pump and dumps. that's mostly a random and impossible to time thing. but usually when the market moves, those small cheap coins move too and hundreds of thousands or millions can be made overnight. /ENDPOST/ this is just to show how we have come a long way from 2013. or have we?not all of those who were "early" knew what the future would bring and there has always been a huge amount of uncertainty around. i wouldn't even dare to amount the people who have lost their keys during this time. it seems that even when you are uncertain of things you should never burn all of the bridges.&gt;but in the end, the answer was obvious. the world's most popular digital currency really is nothing more than an abstraction. so we're destroying the private key used by our bitcon wallet. that leaves our growing pile of bitcoin lucre locked away in a digital vault for all eternity  or at least until someone cracks the sha-256

relatively new to crypto. i know what a stop limit order and a buy order is, and i understand to not try and time the market, but some apps have bots, they supposedly offer passive income, and the top performers offer crazy apr%. has anyone here used any trading bots, and how does that work because the instructions are kind of unclear. the bot warned against using the crypto as currency to feed the bot? is there a reason why? also, i wonder if there is a minimum amount required to generate any real returns.i know it seems too good to be true. it would just be really kind of nice to have that kind of thing set up to make passive income. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ thats actually triggering. i mean i genuinely believe that polygon deserves more love. polygon is one of the most reliable

internet dont give it enough praise.its not only about matic by the way. i mean yea, matic is obviously underpriced, but thats a result of individuals not giving polygon its right share of praise as a project. polygon has been working endlessly on upgrading itself. their main focus recently was on expanding their range of zk products, and theyre doing more than great with the launching of miden, which took place about 2 weeks ago. polygon even hired facebooks winterfell, which is facbooks zk team. i mean what more does it need to do to show that its a leader in the open source zero knowledge?what triggers me is that most individuals, or at least the new ones, dont really believe in this project. i mean ive seen numerous traders talking sh\*t about matic, just because it didnt appreciate in terms of price. i mean if youre an investor, you wouldnt be minding the daily prices right? matic is surely a great investment for the upcoming years. itll surely be doing more than great, but people need to give polygon is right.another thing that im surprised nobody is talking about is polygons contribution in the metaverse. i literally havent seen anyone talking about what matic is delivering to the metaverse. i mean there are more than 10 metaverse projects on polygon, including decentraland, sandbox, real, etc but you wont see anyone talking about that, and i honestly dont know why.and recently the news telling about the will of uniswap to migrate to polygon shows the importance and the strength of this chain, right?i believe going through all the announcements, deals and everything polygon has announced in the last few months would let us know that this project isnt playing around. in addition to all its contribution for the defi and nft scene. its one for the future for sure.ps: no, polygon wont be affected negatively by the arrival of eth2.0, and i dont think we even need to discuss why. /ENDPOST/ recently u/plurbuddha posted a great tldr but some people were complaining that it wasn't short enough so here it goes.i'll try my best to explain, but i advice you join r/nervosnetwork if you wish to know morebasically, nervos aims to be the first universal interoperability utility token; the foundation for web 3.0 where all tokens integrate seamlessly and programmers can deploy an app to all bridged cryptos at the same time(currently bridges with ada and eth exist).also, it is important to mention that the project is backed by bsn (china) and sequoia vc.the concept behind ckb is quite interesting as well since on its l1, 1 ckb will be equal to 1 byte of data. meaning that owning ckb will be akin to owning a prime parcel of land where dev teams will be looking to build dapps. in this sense, only the most important projects will be built on layer 1 for security and the rest will live on layer 2, which is infinitely scalable.this allows for 2 things to happen.1. optimization: only the best apps will take up space on layer 1 and they will optimize for size.3. trilemma solution: by having a layer 1 focused on decentralization and security you can leave layer 2 for scalability.the community also speculates that eventually you will be able to rent out your ckb to dev teams for them to test dapps. ckb is a pow for security (only applies to layer 1). like bitcoin, ckb will have halvings, the first one being on 2023. all in all, the tech is insanely promising and the tokenomics are very well thought out.why buy? imo because the team has been so focused on delivering that they have neglected marketing, so the project is undervalued. recently they launched the first nft marketplace (kollect.me), evm, insane collaborations with many other blockchains and are currently working on a dex called yokaiswap. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ opacity (opct) - highly undervalued smallcap with huge upcoming releases.**introduction:**i'll start off with the disclaimer that i've been invested in opacity for a couple of years now and i wanted to share why i'm still in it and why i believe in it. it recently reached a new ath, but i believe that it can still grow much more, especially as i'm in it for the fundamentals. i believe that online privacy is more important than ever right now with tech giants like facebook and google having no respect for people's privacy.opacity is a private and anonymous storage provider, where you don't even need an email address to set up an account and your uploaded files are encryped client-side and chunked, so that not even the opacity team knows which files are yours or what they are. ease of use is the other main selling point of opacity.**current state:**the most up to date and easiest way of using opacity is by using the webapp that reached version 2.0 earlier this year and it's very user friendly.the current downside is that opacity is not decentralised, but sia will be added very soon as a storage provider and as a stepping stone to full decentralisation. as a long term goal, opacity aims to become a gateway for storage providers, including both large enterprises like amazon's aws to sia's or storj's network, with the main added benefit being the privacy and anonymity layer.each opct is currently worth 64gb, but that will change as soon as full decentralisation kicks in, since anyone running a node will be able to charge what they want for their provided storage. with decentralisation it will also be possible to stake your coins.due to current issues with ethereum fees, opct is also available as a wrapped version on the polygon network. another small, but important point is that opacity has a hardcap of 130 million tokens with all tokens having already been distributed.**coming very soon:**there is an upcoming mobile app which will be released very soon (currently in the last stages of beta testing), which is huge because it targets a much larger group. the sia node development is currently being worked on and should also be released soon, which means that opacity will very soon be decentralised.an ama with ceo jason coppola that will be hosted by polygon is scheduled for december 9th.**market:**opacity currently has a market cap of 60 million, which compared to fil's 6 billion, leaves it with a huge amount of room for growth. how many other smallcaps with a working product are there even out there? that's one of the many reasons i believe that it's still hugely undervalued.**op** /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ hi my fellow crypto friends,i'm not a massive social media guy. obviously i have reddit and have found it very useful in the past thanks to you guys! but i am also looking to add twitter to my list of social media accounts!is there accounts that anyone could recommend to me, for news etc. (and obviously calling the moonshots before they happen!)i figured you guys would be the best people to ask as you are real people looking for the same things as me!i appriciate any suggestions at all!also any youtube accounts? i already watch coin beauro but looking to broaden my horizons there too! thanks!! /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ it's about time uniswap hopped on the polygon train. it seems like all the og ethereum dapps have made the move. for good reason too, polygon is an immaculate ethereum scaling solution that no other l2 or any l1s for that matter are going to compete with.the proposal to get uniswap on polygon received 7.79m upvotes, 7 million people want this to happen. this is massive and i predict that polygon is going to be seeing a 15% price increase if this bullish sentiment continues.we all know ethereum is plagued by gas fees and this was frankly the only thing holding uniswap back, the only reason i think a lot of us would use something else is because of these fees. them mitigating to polygon means that uniswap as well as polygon are going to explode.i don't know about you but this puts any polygon fud to rest in my eyes, i truly think this scaling solution is unbeatable. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ i was looking at liquidity providing on uniswap.  i understand the idea of impermanent loss that if the value of one of the assets in the pair rises more than the other, then you will miss out on part of that gain.  however, if you add liquidity at a peak in the market and he value of he assets falls, will you benefit from that more than holding the assets outright during the fall? for instance, i used an impermanent loss calculator with an eth/usdc pair for instance.  obviously when the prices increase i will lose some eth, but redeem the same value (in dollars) as i originally locked.  if the prices fall after i add the liquidity, then the calculator actually said that i would be able to remove more eth than i originally added.  so does this mean that adding liquidity for the bear market could actually leverage the amount of assets you have? as you can see in the picks, if eth fell 80%, you would still lose money in the pool, but you would more than double the amount of eth you own in the pool. /ENDPOST/

wrecked.heres a little checklist to make sure your crypto and online accounts in general are as secure as possible:- check recovery phrases using ledger / trevor official apps you may not have used in a long time. make sure youre using the official apps and only entering the phrase on the hardware device and not online. even if you lose your hardware wallet your seed phrase can recreate your wallet.- write recovery phrase/s down using pen, paper and store in a safe - or buy a metal tablet style phrase holder. never screen shot, store in a text file or store digitally.- move long term hodl funds off exchanges/software wallets to a hardware wallet like trezor / ledger.- write down authenticator backup  codes in case your lose your phone or account access (important not just for crypto).- make unique passwords for every account that uses your email. strongly consider using a password management app and have a super strong master password and 2step authenticator.- consider having unique emails/browsers for crypto related accounts eg .coinbase, cdc etc- add a sim pin to secure your mobile number- ensure two factor auth (or more if possible) or email, exchange and software wallets.- shouldnt need to be said but never share your recovery phrase with anyone.interesting fact: the paraphrase recovery words have been chosen to not share the same first 4 letters.please feel free to add your best practice tips - stay safe! /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ i have found this to be a very helpful thing when it

if you are like most of the people here your first thought will be, shit i have to buy this before it goes 100% up. you buy. 10 minutes later it is already 10-15% down. 1 day later it's only 5% up from its previous price. you are stuck with a bag.the opposite situation, omega covid strikes, we are facing 75 years of isolation and restrictive measures - markets go down 20%. your first thought, shit i better sell, it will go down more, and i'll be smarter than the next idiot and buy much cheaper. you sell. 1 hour later it turns out omega ain't that  alpha strain, we'll only be stuck with it for the next 5 years, staying home watching netflix isn't that bad, and yes, the market is already 8% up. you screwed up again.third situation, you have a sizeable bag of a decent coin. it randomly starts pumping 10,20,30,40% up. you rub one out watching those sweet green dildos. you don't get the post nut clarity because you are still mesmerized by potentially even greater gains. shit, this may be my ticket to retirement. you don't take any profits out, but then again you don't take out your girlfriend either, so it's ok. 2 hours later you are stuck with a limp dick in your hand and a coin that has returned to its previous price because it pumped off fake news. quote clay davis: shiiiiitwhat if you did the opposite for once?if you just hodl, dca and don't get moved by market ups-downs,

if you will buy it. or even buy at ath and will be at loss for few weeks or months.every time someone advice you to buy something, every time people shill some coins or brag about their portfolio they do marketing  for their projects even if they are not aware of it. most people most of the time will not brag about coin if they don't have business in it. if coin is good they hold it. if it pump they want it to pump more so they talk more and more to create hype.i am not saying never trust people advices. but treat them only as advice, nothing more. dyor and then decide. you will get less good advices about coin that pump now. everyone is bullish, but ask yourself if they would say the same few days ago before pump or if they will say the same next week, when pump will end? in most cases not.  best advices are those made before coin pump. see difference between: " look at this coin it have potential to pump in future" or "it is great coin, it pumping now". of course always dyor, but long term advices are usually better than short term advices.everyone want to get piece of cake. coin pump naive people fomo. smartest people bought much earlier, smarter bought before you. now you need to wait for someone dumber and more desperate than you to buy at even higher price. at some point correction will happen and people that bough last will be at red. no one can time market. you are not exception. if some coin pump, make a tea and look at all those fomoers with pity and buy something that haven't pumped yet. /ENDPOST/ note i think down the road there will be more ways to make money in and around the metaverse, and there maybe some ways i missed. if that is the case then leave a comment.anyways, these are the ways i can find currently how to make money with the metaverse.active:1. normal crypto trading. trading metaverse coins.2. play to earn. note this might sound like a great thing, but realistically you're very very unlikely to make a living in a first world country with this method. in fact, it is unrealistic this will even pay for a hobby. at least with current play to earn models. this might change when companies find a way for you playing they make real money and there will be a reason for them to pay you more and more.3. do services or other things within the metaverse. so for example, if you're a teacher and you use the metaverse to teach your students. back in the day on second life there use to be some that made a little money in this. normally what would happen is a place would hold an event and you would be paid to do stuff at the event.4. land - hold events. this normally takes the same skills as in real life.5. land - trading. this is the normal buy low sell high.passive:1. if there is any staking or mining. i don't know of any that does this. but if there is one, just like normal staking and mining it is pretty passive.2. land - renting. you can rent land in the metaverse and payments will auto come in. unlike the real world things don't break and when they don't pay the software kicks them out. also many times the software will take care of it where if others want to rent your land.3. land - gambling. note this might require a real world license in many areas, and this takes a bit of upfront cost. but it's very hands off since all but things like poker is hands off. and even then it's hands off since that is other players.4. selling nft (art or items). basically, the active part of it is making and listing. but you can setup shops in or around the metaverse which allows the item to be sold. you can set it up where there is only so many copies, or you can set it up where people can keep buying. so like if you made a car to use in the metaverse. you could then set a limit of 100 of them or just let it keep selling. but after the making of the nft and listing it. it's all hands off. and btw i think this is where the real money is at. even more if you can put your models in many games as possible. note in some metaverse you will need to have land to do this. but many you don't. but also you're pushing your stuff out in a nft market that is over flooded already.5. make games or other things that take care of itself. it is like the event, but instead of it being a 1 time thing. it just keeps going. after it is setup, there is no hands on.6. ads. based on the traffic on your land you might be able to show ads on your land.&amp;#x200b;realistically, at this time the only way to make enough to live off of at this time is owning land and doing something with it, or normal crypto trading.

syndrome is the situation where people focus all attention on something that is new, current or trendy, yet drop this as soon as something new takes its place.how does that apply in r/cryptocurrency?1. some currencies experience significant rallies, they shine.1. some people fomo-in at different times in the rallies, especially by the end, near aths. as the currency appreciates, the same number of tokens implies a larger volume in fiat.1. hodling a currency that has experienced a significant rally, and has limited, none, or negative price action, hodlers have three options:1. sell, possibly at a loss. sell low after buying high. you may see mentions in the comments, but not much, it is a fairly quiet group.1. hodl and be quiet, as most people do, i am sure.1. hodl and shill. as [choice-supportive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/choice-supportive_bias) kicks in, some people decide that _they are still early_, and that the rally will continue, if people just realize what a bargain their chosen currency is! so they shill it, and become very visible in the sub, at some point it may seem that half the sub is shilling the last currency that experienced a significant rally and then a big red candle or two. obviously, they also have an economic incentive to do that, it should not come as a surprise.now you know:1. why the sub moves from hating something like centralization to loving a currency that displays a high level of centralization.1. moves from hating a new currency that threatens their latest shiny object to loving it after they adopt the new currency as their new shiny object and swap their portfolio towards it, buying it high.1. occasionally moves from loving a currency to hating it, possibly after selling it low or shorting it.1. why the "hive mind" of the sub seems to be bipolar, moving from some kind of ocd towards a currency to postpartum depression and rejection to their once beloved baby, and even an us-vs-them hate when there is a new rally.considering how predictable this behavior is (just after a big rally and one or two bad candles), the flood of posts about one or another currency should not be a surprise for anyone. we have seen it many times, we will see it many more.advice: noisy does not mean important, most often it is the opposite. ignore the noisy groups of people. they do not give information about the future as much as about the past.hth. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ im curious to see what are some prices people have joined in at seeing that theyre people who have bought in

is a circulating supply of 3.5 billion and a market cap of 367 million. a fully diluted circulating supply is 10 billion and market cap of estimated 1 billion.what's the future of alc?well they just announced a partnership with visa and mastercard in august https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alchemy-pay-launching-virtual-crypto-181925096.html they are also located in the same place as cro who coincidentally uses... visa as their card service provider.well that's coincidence right?https://www.bquayartgallery.com/crypto-com-cro-partners-with-alchemy-to-facilitate-application-development-on-its-blockchain/cro and alchemy have worked together before back in january.&gt;alchemy will provide a full suite of tools and services to make it easier for developers to build applications on the crypto.com chain, the companys blockchain.&gt;this partnership will reduce operating and maintenance costs for application developers , who would otherwise have to host full nodes themselves, improve the competitiveness of partner products, and increase overall accessibility of the crypto.com chain.this part is huge imo. alchemy helped cro get going and now is the token used by the card service that cro uses.tldr: alchemy (may) be the token that cro/ visa/mastercard use for fiat to crypto transactions and they have a history. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ question:ispos in cardano: are you in any?what is ispo?initial stake pool offering.as we know, cardano (ada) is very solid in terms of staking. as shown on stakingrewards.comnot only you can stake to a pool and earn ada but also you may stake on a project pool and earn in return for that staking some of their future tokens/coins too.some dexes (decentralized exchanges) have done this, like meld (meld) which has already closed ispo.some currently have ispo open like mirqur.io and you can earn mqr or xxrraayy.org (ray network) and earn xray i like this last one because they have a nice implemented rewards dashboardyou collect some tokens each epoch (each 5 days) and whenever you want you send 2 ada to the claiming address and get back like 1,5 ada and collected xray reward tokens.more info on their page.also i am participating with flickto.io which has now going an ispo that will have automatic rewards from feb to june and after that until a given epoch has to be then manually claimed, this project is not a dex its a way to fund media like films series etc through crypto, you vote projects if they win you get % of them if not, nothing happens.so yes, pretty things coming for cardano ecosystem, and this is a way to join before hand.i like ispos, what about you? have you done any? /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ polkadot is a bit strange in many ways and most of it is not explained in a way that is obvious to non-programmers.(for example, i could not figure out why i couldn't see my funds in my wallet until someone explained to me the difference between polkadot. js the app/site and polkadot. js the extension. this was not explained in the official documentation, which shows how to set up the extension, but doesn't mention that it is not a full wallet, like metamask, phantom, temple, etc.)but the "feature" of reaping deserves special attention and should be understood by anyone (potentially) involved in the dot ecosystem:**if you have less than 1 dot in a wallet all the coins in that wallet will be burned and gone forever.**this means that if you have alt-coins in that wallet as well as some dot and you decide to send that dot to an exchange for trading, you will lose all your alt-coins, no matter what they are worth. unless you leave at least 1 dot behind.just something to be aware of. /ENDPOST/ hello! i'm researching all the various organizations that play a role in the crypto market.for example, in the beginning, we've had mining manufacturers and exchanges. now, we have daos, nft marketplaces, and et cetera. so i wonder just how wide is the market and how we could group them all by the same definitions/categories.here's the list of all the possible categories i could come up with:* cryptocurrency* blockchain network* mining hardware manufacturer* mining hardware retail* mining pool* crypto wallet manufacturer* crypto wallet retail* online wallet service* cloud mining service* cryptocurrency exchange* decentralized exchange* defi protocol* decentralized app* dao* staking service* analytical software* nft project* nft marketplace* blockchain video game* play to earn video game* financial services* development studio* marketing services* mediasome of them may be the same thing or be a part of another.are there other categories that are missing? can some categories be confusing? what do you think about this? /ENDPOST/ i saw a post here saying: "i am happy that plan b is wrong this month." well, not so fast, we still have 1 day left till the end of the month to it 98k.if we just print a 30k candle from here, we can still easily hit it, right? don't lose hope so fast, this is crypto, not the stock market.probably i am not even bullish enough, i think we can easily hit 200k by the end of the month. i like to stay conservative, because i don't want to become disappointed. so if we go higher than 200k, it's also fine, but at least i won't be disappointed.if we just quickly convince warren buffet to buy a bunch of bitcoin - because we know he's a big bitcoin fan - then we can easily hit 98k. i don't understand why you guys lose hope so fast. this is the month where we're all going to be rich.trust me bro. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ it's been 4 years since bitcoin broke 10k and it's nostalgic to think about all the bitcoin to 10k memes and the memes when it finally broke 10k. prior to that bitcoin took 3+ years to go from 1k to 2k and after it reached 2k it was just a matter of months to break the 10k. this was a great time for many who invested and many thought that it had reached it's peak. as time progressed and the price started to drop people though that bitcoin was dead then came the bull of 2020. this was one of the greatest pumps of any investment that anyone every owned before.ever since the pump of 2020 people have become so hopeful that their great project would achieve the same pump and status of bitcoin. people have been investing with the hope of those x1000 gains and when their investment shows any form of stagnation it automatically become a stable coin or failed project.people need to remember that prior to 2014 it took bitcoin 5 years to break the 1k barrier. if you invested in a project after proper evaluation and it hasn't pump just be patient. if the project has utility it will pump someday no matter what.many project have pumped and people are saying that it has reached its peak the same as when bitcoin reached 10k and started to dip. this serves as an example that even though the general public thinks that a project has reached it's peak they are just assuming and once it has utility it will grow even more.we are still early..... /ENDPOST/ one thing i have learned is that most of the time when this sub is full of posts from one coin and the last come out of their corners and shill their coins "this is just the beginning, see u at the moon", the hype is probably already over and that is the first sign to think about taking profits.the greed of people is immeasurable and i don't want to exclude myself here, be smart and learn from my mistakes. we tend to think that nothing can stop us when we see green waves for days, but then after a few days comes the bad awakening.you know how it is, " could have, should have, would have...", but you know what, it doesn't work that way.you should have an exit strategy and i know that's often said but it can't be said often enough. however, if you are here for the long term dca and hold. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ i understand the relief it gives to have a guaranteed "no loss" if you take out your initial investment.but, i dont see how that would make any sense financially. if you put 1k and price rise to 5k, why would taking out 1k put you in any good/better position?you had 5k and you can decide what to do with that, either keep investing, take out half and keep half invested, take all out and invest in something else, take 4k out and keep 1k invested, etc etc.in all these situations taking your initial investment out makes no sense at all.if anyone has something else to add to my thinking, please add. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ it is as simple as that, if they had a secret method to making millions they would keep it to themselves. all of these youtube and telegram tip channels are simply pump and dump schemes where they buy into a token cheap and then shill it to their followers so that they can dump their shitcoins at a profit.the old saying "if its too good to be true, then it isn't true" applies 99% of the time in crypto. there are a few individuals out there that do share their genuine knowledge but they are far and few between, dont get suckered into the biggest and most prolific scam in crypto! /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ we've all seen the stories, in this sub as well as in the legaladvice and personalfinance subs, about people having their entire bank accounts "transferred to the us government" because they got flagged for potential money laundering. this is a us thing, it doesn't seem to happen very often, but it's terrifying and fucking heart breaking to read the stories. quite often it's someone's life savings and it's questionable if they _ever_ get it back.i'm thinking of putting together a website where people can share their stories, and have them organized by bank and country, so that users can get an idea which banks might be "officially" ok with crypto but have extra touchy aml procedures that might put you at risk.i'd also have a section for banks that have never had a crypto related complaint and thus can at least anecdotally be assumed to be more crypto safe / friendly.would this have any value to you guys? and do you worry about the safety of your fiat as much as i do, in large part because of coinbase (or other) transactions moving in and out of your bank account? /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ hello mooners,as you already know, we are working on rcpswap - full dex that will allow you to swap between reddit community points.everything will be powered by smart contracts meaning that to swap, you will need to interact with the smart contract (metamask) via the interface on rcpswap.com (will be deployed on launch)on launch, moons  bricks  and moond will be available for on the dex (moond is originally on bsc network, to get it on reddit arbitrum you will need to bridge which is simply sending tokens to smart contract - more info on launch).we would like to have a stablecoin on rcpswap and we need your help to see which stablecoin is used the most.we thought busd bep20 is great but not all exchanges supports it.remember that it should be low fees to transfer so we are asking more for network to use rather than the stablecoin itself (like layer 2 arbitrum network or usdc on sol) /ENDPOST/ the majority of you all have probably realised this or at least made a similar mistake once but i cannot stress enough that when setting up 2fa read about it first, find the best 2fa app and make sure you know exactly what you are doing before setting it up.i stupidly did not do my dd on 2fa and opted to use the google authenticator as a way to tighten security on one of my exchanges, upon completing this and then looking into how i could back google authenticator up i found nothing, so i did research into other 2fa apps and came across authy which you can back up.i now have to go through the painstaking process of trying to get google authenticator off the exchange and set it up with authy.so please, please do your dd and dont use google authenticator as for the time being my phone is now worth however much is on that exchange :) /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ my grandpa is an 71-year old retired physics and mathematics professor and crypto enthusiast. he bought his first 10 bitcoins (he told me he sold them just two years later) in 2013 after crypto got a little more traction in the mainstream media and ever since then he has been on about the mathematical potential of blockchain technology. he is not in it for the money, his retirement benefits are more than enough, but for the tech.since he was the only man in his age group invested in crypto i was curious how old crypto investors usually are.cryptocurrency buyers breakdown by generation:[source: https:\/\/www.stilt.com\/blog\/2021\/03\/vast-majority-crypto-buyers-millennials-gen-z\/](https://preview.redd.it/glriwv9e1k281.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ef650c255befa6db80258218dd263340ffb66ad)boomers (57+) are only 1,22% of all the crypto investors and the age group from 65+ are probably a fraction from that percentage. makes me think that older age groups are still not taking this whole thing serious and if they would, the market would probably explode (since they have a lot more capital to invest than millenials for example)interestingly enough "even though gen x buyers only make up 4.9% of all crypto buyers, they bought an average of $9,611 in cryptocurrency over 12 months, or:* 1.6x more than gen z buyers* 1.1x more than millennial buyersolder people  whove had more time to advance in their careers and who have access to large lines of credit  have more spending power and disposable income.how those individuals are spending that money on crypto  especially compared to younger buyers  is a bit surprising, though.as mentioned above, younger gen z and millenial crypto buyers outnumber older buyers  by \~15x. so, it would be easy to chalk this all up to older investors uncertainty about an emerging and potentially volatile market and younger buyers willingness to take more risk.but the data tells a different story.it shows clearly that, not only are gen x crypto buyers outspending younger buyers, but also that theres also a correlation between increasing age and bigger spending on crypto."

i have time. this would be a long stock for me. 5 years. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ crosspost from /crypto_com for exposure (and pressure on cdc).i know this is only the most basic fucntion of any exchange, but it would be great if cdc would spend less time post-bombing /cryptocurrency with hype posts, and instead implement easy money transfer from us banks to the crypto.com app.i use a major bank and it's a five step process just to pay off a coffee transaction from the crypto.com "credit card."i'm not trying to create a flame war with all the cro fanboys (don't worry, when you have an excellent product, your time will come). my only point is, that if they are trying to be the easiest and most omnipresent exchange, **you have to make the most basic premise (getting money onto the exchange) as frictionless as possible.**if you want /cryptocurrency hype posts every other hour, and 100% gains, fine, but i'd prefer a long-term working product that is superior to coinbase. right now, the slapdash "credit card" (and i use this term insanely generously) is the only thing cdc has going for it.coinbase makes it simple.cdc requires work-arounds for almost everything.this is factual, and hopefully with a little more dedication to project, and less to viral marketing, they can get there.nothing about cdc is easy right now. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ the british treasury last year announced the launch of a new 2% sales charge on online vendors, search engines and social media providers with global revenue of over usd 666.4m and domestic sales above the usd 33.3m mark.telegraph, the tax office has informed crypto exchanges that they are subject to the levy, which was created in a bid to make sure the likes of google and amazon who have been criticized for finding tax workarounds in the uk  contribute more to the treasury coffers.the same media outlet noted that although coinbase uk operations had reported sales worth just under usd 24m, the company recently reported that global revenues had quadrupled, meaning it is likely to pass the uk threshold in 2021.however, the tax may be short-lived, at least in its current form: earlier this year, the g20 agreed to create a streamlined tax essentially aimed at global tax giants. the measure will force some of the world's biggest companies to cough up some usd 150bn in extra tax revenue each year.last month, the bbc reported that g20 chiefs had agreed to create a global minimum tax rate of 15% for large companies, and would enforce the measure starting in 2023. /ENDPOST/ the bitcoin white paper was released on oct. 31st 2008. on may 22nd 2010 the first bitcoin for goods transaction happened (one pizza for 10k btc). you're not early in this game, if you've just learned about crypto and entered the market. i wasn't early either. but you know what? that doesn't matter at all. sure, you're not gonna make that 5000x with btc anymore but, look what happened until now and imagine how powerful the crypto space will look like on october 31st in 2038. crypto is here to stay, things that we can't even think of right now, are going to be built, changing what we've been taking for granted, all having their roots in satoshis white paper. and we all have the chance to be part of it simply because crypto is permissionless.so who even cares if someone is earyl or late in this game?

we basically send money to the seller directly through bank, the crypto app (binance, for example) has no connection to the bank. i think it's extremely difficult to track down crypto trading. what do you guys think?are there any people here who trade crypto even though it's not legal in their country? /ENDPOST/ hello, basically what the title says. i won't name the token i own since i don't want this post to come off as me shilling a coin.anyway i have a hefty amount of them and want to make a plan on how to sell them eventually.i can swap the tokens to erc20 but i don't want to do that because of high gas fees. fees are much lower on the binance smart chain.so what is a good course of action? should i swap the tokens for a stable coin then send them to a centralized exchange to sell for fiat or convert to another coin/token?i'm not too familiar with dexs yet or the many swaps like pancake swap, sushi swap, etc. if there's a good way for me to dip my toe in, i would be open to that too.whats a strategy that has worked well for you? thanks in advance for any advice and good luck to all! /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ hi everyone ! after a lot of pressure and advices from my friends i'm finally investing a bit in cryptos.i'm not understanding everything yet, and even if i'm trying to learn by scrolling here it's a bit hard sometimes haha.so if you're okay with it i'd love a piece of advice. like what to know absolutely, where to invest, and why ? (i dont understand every crypto yet, so many acronymes and no explanation hahaha)my main goal is a long term investment, since i'm not scared of dips or shits like this (i have money invested on safe places to back me up so no worries) and i already put 3000 on swissborg (like 1500 on ethereum, 750 on poly and 750 on chz, on my friend's advice) and i still have 2000 to invest but i dont know where.was thinking about like 1000 or 1500 on bitcoin but what about the rest ?thanks for your answers (and sorry for my english, not my main language) /ENDPOST/ on 11/10 binance updated their systems to dogecoin core 1.14.5 which reduced fees from 1 doge to .01 doge per kb.[this resulted in a ton of locked transactions (due to insufficient funds to get processed).](https://twitter.com/dogecoin_devs/status/1458868925039464451?s=21). these transactions were previously processed via a reissue but the locked transaction were never removed from the binance mempool. as a result it is estimated up to 1b doge was burnt/sent to old users [by replicating old transactions from 2019 of 1,674 users.](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/community/doge-update-working-hard-to-reopen-withdrawals-421499824684903084)[binance originally estimated withdrawals would be frozen for 10-14 days but updated their estimate a further 10-14 days from 11/15.](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/7602e2790f3c444d8d6ed47d6954bcef)as you can expect binance had not publicly disclosed the true value of the loss or how much had been returned by their users. however binance was expected to eat the loss and repurchase the unreturned doge on behalf of their users.[earlier this morning binance released a blog relating to the issue to say, no single entity was at fault, neither binance nor doge network had prior knowledge of this rare issue. they also said doge withdrawals are again fully open.](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/community/the-inside-story-on-doge-withdrawals-421499824684903102)-fun fact: [a week after the incident on 11/17 cz was publicly stating that crypto should be regulated.](https://time.com/6120519/binance-crypto-market-regulation/) you can reasonably assume they thought it might have kept them from eating some of the losses they incurred. /ENDPOST/ is there somewhere to look up which network version of each coin is on each of the various exchanges? i havent found much at all on the exchanges websites saying which version of each coin they support. i am worried about mixing it up and sending the wrong version to the wrong type wallet address and potentially losing my coins.example: chz on kucoin looks to be bep2 but erc20 on other exchanges. fantom has an erc-20 version and i believe the opera chain.any type of resource or place to get started would be helpful. thanks in advance. /ENDPOST/ the world of streetwear, fashion, and sneakers were met with the shocking news of louis vuitton's virgil abloh's passing away. virgil worked with nike; spear headed his own brand off-white; and as recently reported, worked as the lvmh designer.in january, 2021, virgil created this iconic 3d "skyscraper" jackets for louis vuitton fall/winter 2021 show. looking back, it is clear that he had other ideas in mind- which is affirming that the digital world would soon be, or is ready to be merged with they physical world.&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/8m8aw3kcqj281.png?width=370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb27e83c7608e2255f66876d2c9beabeb0e0d827about 12 hours ago from the posting of this post, a [tweet](https://twitter.com/fehrsam/status/1465173368999583752?s=20) by fred ehrsam (ex co-founder of coinbase, and now with paradigm) shared the drafted vision of virgil known as "skyscraper." this file had ever since been taken down for an undisclosed reason.briefly in 25 pages, virgil shared his vision of web 3.0, nft, and dao.this was the line explaining "skyscraper"&gt;"what i have been running in my head is to start a real-life, digital museum. for it to become an institution where the currency used in that space is my unique social token. inside the space will be my work, but also the work of a community of adjacent artists operating on a token of the space."the project was supposed to have 5 core 'path of development.' this is from building a corporate structure, designing original nfts, partnerships, cultivation of artists, and "skyscraper" to be both a digital space with a physical feel.in his vision, he shared how in the past, digital is its own entity, but now, the physical world is inevitably tied to the digital world- in simpler terms, the metaverse of a digital 'building' with brands from the very top to the newly budding talents.&amp;#x200b;in his words;https://preview.redd.it/b9zj0bj4sj281.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb1f2f4ca1d1a65cae61ae90f69a345bae47936&amp;#x200b;brands such as lvmh is no stranger to nft. they've been investing in several entities such as arianee previously, and now exploring to launch nfts via aura luxury blockchain. this will enable buyers to have access to the product history and proof of authenticity of their purchased luxury goods  from sourcing to sales, all the way to second-hand markets- via nft.virgil's first nft was known as "self potrait" and he had envisioned how his idea of "skyscraper" dao would be smashing through louvre.&amp;#x200b;[virgil abloh's \\"self potrait\\"](https://preview.redd.it/vfcmxa3urj281.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46e1aa0fe939499c3309dffe0adb5df646564439)in a way, it represents the current generation smashing through the expectations of the high barriers to entry for a 'museum.' some would say, it is to liberate the pieces that's held by a museum which isn't supposed to be there. the power of the people shall return. the idea isn't something new, but i would've banked on virgil to be the one to have executed it perfectly.i got a lot of respect to the works done by virgil abloh, and it's bitter sweet seeing "skyscraper" may launch without the man, himself. but one thing for sure, the future will see blockchain being a major part of it. that being said, the world has lost one of its brightest stars but his ideas will live on.rest in power, virgil abloh. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ at one point, i had optimism for etc.  "code is law," it seems, was an excellent concept.however, the etc community is a shambles, and growth appears to be stalled and split.  there are also better evm implementations. so that's out of my portfolio.however, after i understood more about bch, it was clear to me that its bad connotation was unwarranted and that the currency itself was undervalued.it appears that bch is the target of an intensive disinformation effort.i'd even say both bch and btc, in my opinion, are the actual bitcoin. the goal was to create a decentralized currency that could be used to transfer funds and was built in such a manner that development could be done openly. this is something that people frequently overlook.bitcoin has achieved its mission since it can fork whenever it needs to in order to achieve the goals of whatever developer. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ there seems to be alot of talk about how cardano is slow to build traction. i'd just like to share one of the projects being deployed right now with real world benefits to (soon) millions of africans. below is a quick snapshot of how it works (world mobile token is built on cardano)&gt;theres a lot of fiber optics that have been laid throughout the continent, and we pick up on the last mile of fiber and use alternative spectrums like free-space optics, or other radio spectrums that do not require licensing, world mobile group ceo and founder micky watkins told techcrunch.&gt;&gt;watkins said that because they do not require licenses for these alternative spectrums they get a massive tax saving, which translates to cheaper internet for users.&gt;&gt;we use these alternative spectrums to build the backhaul (connection between an access node and the core network) and then create a device (node) that people can use to pick up from that backhaul, said watkins.&gt;&gt;for sustainability, the air nodes will be owned by private entities, through a one-off fee of about $7,000 that they will recoup over time by earning income or rewards in the form of world mobile token (wmt), the operators cryptocurrency, as people connect to the internet through their access points.https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/world-mobile-group-bringing-zanzibaris-online-through-mobile-network-built-on-blockchain/so real world use case of cheaper internet infrastructure funded via crypto powered by cardano. isn't this what we all envisioned as one of the millions of use cases for crypto to be able to accomplish? gives me some sense of accomplishment/contribution to stake cardano. /ENDPOST/ i got tagged in a reply to this post

was a bit late getting back to op but figured it would be worthwhile to share my response as a regular post to help others learn more about nervos. also here are links to articles providing information about the functionality of nervos. enjoy!nervos team:

party but here goesi made this in response to a tokenomics question awhile back.thanks for asking man. this is probably one of my favorite aspects of nervos and one that also gets over looked quite a lot too. first here is the [cryptoeconomic whitepaper](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0015-ckb-cryptoeconomics/0015-ckb-cryptoeconomics.md). second some quick facts: 1 ckbyte = 1 byte so 1m ckbytes = 1mb of space. all ckbytes turn into cells when data is stored on them, they return to coins when the data is destroyed, coins can only turn into 1 cell at a time. a coin with data currently stored on it is called a live cell, destroying that data and returning the cell into a coin means that ckbyte is now a dead cell. it's coin functionality is not disrupted when it is a dead cell.so beyond all the great technology that is being innovated and developed on or by nervos, it is maybe the most well thought out economic system for a blockchain.to start we have the genesis block which is currently being mined, and holds a total of 33.57b ckbytes. upon creation 25% (8.375b) was "burned", it wasn't actually destroyed but stored away as an emergency fund that can supply the secondary issuance for up to 4 years. it can only be accessed if the circulating supply hits 0 and the network is unable to pay miners and dao holders. only miners get rewards from the genesis block (base issuance) which halves every 4 years like btc. this keeps miner compensation stable with incentive to continue protecting the network, when the block is fully mined this incentive pay will stop.secondary issuance is an annual inflation of 1.344b coins added into circulation. this inflation is an added tool to control network bloat via state rent for all users with ckbytes stored on the common knowledge base that are not locked within the dao. it also guarantees that devs will have new coins for data storage as live cells. secondary issuance is only paid out to miners, nervos dao, &amp; treasury.* miners receive compensation equal to the percentage of data occupied ckbytes* nervos dao recieves compensation equal to the percentage of ckbytes deposited in the dao* treasury recieves compensation equal to what is left over. currently the treasury doesnt exist and the remaining coins are burned for real each year.so if 60% of total supply is stored data 60% of secondary issuance goes to miners, 35% of total supply deposited in dao 35% of secondary issuance is issued to dao holders to fight inflation. that remaining 5% would get deposited into the treasury once it exists. so far there has been an issuance for three years '19,'20, &amp;'21, originally secondary issuance was only supposed to come after the genesis block was mined but the dao was needed to lock up coins. i'm also not entirely sure if miners are also receiving their portion from the issuance or if that too is being burned along with the treasury share. secondary issuance is also necessary so new coins can be used to create live cells and the network can grownow with such a high circulating supply and annual inflation it would take forever for ckb to increase in price and its only value would just come from nervos saying look it's money use it as such. this brings us back to ckbytes data storage functionality. since every byte of data consumes 1 ckbyte and every function on nervos requires ckbytes, constant use of the network will consistently decrease the circulating supply. this allows ckb to become a sov rather than a basic currency, this makes ckbytes like land giving nervos value from storage space rather than a basic claim that the coin is money. if the genesis block is fully mined and the only amount of secondary issuance being pushed into circulation is miner's dues as they would be the most liquid after issuance then market cap/circulating supply &gt; market cap/total supply.for example: lets say btc's market cap is 1t and nervos somehow matches that.* $1t/33.57b=$29.788 per coin - if this was a regular coin this would be the max price the coin could achieve at this market cap with the added inflation the value would constantly deplete each year.* now lets say 60% of issuance is all that gets added into circulation and the market cap is still 1t. 1.334b/60%= 800,400,000 ckb  1t/800.4m=$1,249.375 per coincurrently there are 11.01b ckb locked in the [dao](https://explorer.nervos.org/charts/total-dao-deposit) (1b = 1gb) with a [circulating supply](https://explorer.nervos.org/charts/total-supply) of 27.75b. that's a 39.65% [deposit to circulation ratio](https://explorer.nervos.org/charts/circulation-ratio) which will be taken from the next issuance in '22there are a total of 11.7m [cells](https://explorer.nervos.org/charts/cell-count) on the ckb, only 456,580k are live cells. the number of live cells will increase as more projects develop and run on the network, this is what determines the miner's dues from secondary issuance.lastly liquidity &amp; lending, which keeps the whole system flowing. while this hasn't been fully implemented yet, there has been a clear goal by nervos since their whitepapers to allow ckbyte owners to rent out their coins to developers or others as storage space becomes more and more scarce. the biggest issue with this entire economic design was the poor liquidity that was developed especially early on. unless you own a mining rig the dao is the only manner in which you can "stake" to earn coins. you can only withdraw once a month from the dao so this creates low liquidity. [sudt's](https://talk.nervos.org/t/nervosdao-derivation-token-for-staking-dckb-version-2/5248) were conceptualized which helped to create [dckb](https://talk.nervos.org/t/break-the-liquidity-limitation-of-nervosdao/4653) as a manner for locked up coins to be usable and liquid. they function exactly like a normal coin but with a smart contract that destroys the corresponding ckb thats earned under dao compensation. this would allow devs to rent a portion of ckb that is earned while stored in the dao, successful projects can then repay their loan + interest using ckb or dckb in either case the native coin will be transferred or burned accordingly. dckb will see a lot of use on layer 2, defi, and smart contracts that recognize dckb as an asset.ckb-vm uses risc-v as its operating language. there area few reasons for doing so first is the fact that it is a hardware emulator making it the lowest level software in the stack. this allows the vm to process tx and blocks based around cpu cycles keeping things as small and efficient as possible. secondly, its an assembly language so updates don't require hard forks to the network. extensions can be added allowing the vm to actually grow with the network and adapt as is needed with new governance rules. third, unlike solidity and web assembly the risc-v software can replicate a full computer allowing any programming language to run on top of it. uniquely any other software actually runs inside of the ckb-vm without any disruptions to its native functionality.\#3 should be enough to make anyone bullish, this means programs from web 2.0 can be easily adopted onto web 3.0. think along the lines of using adobe ps on a decentralized network which is huge for mass adoption of crypto in general.abstraction within nervos is also amazing. they have pushed token and nft standards to be used as more than just a currency that functions on the network and unique artwork.* simple udt (sudt) is the token standard and is named because the coding for the token is simple and a few lines at most.* extensible udt (xudt) builds on top of sudt to come with regulation compliance and the ability to even stop or detract a payment if conditions are not met.* compact udt (cudt) allows for xudt to shrink and become more efficient for data heavy assests.nft's have been pushed to include decentralized identity, dynamic interactions, and again includes a compact nft variant.security is pow and uses nakamoto consensus-max a modified version that allows the btc native consensus to remain impervious to attack without the cost of network throttling.layer 2 is godwoken which is a rollup framework it currently runs optimistic rollups and is in the process of supporting zk rollups with plans to support other rollups after that. that means nervos is already running eth 2.0.lastly there is forcebridge which allows nervos to be connected with other blockchains. since the vm is risc-v no matter what the native vm is for a blockchain nervos can interpret and run it. this is also true for the reverse since risc-v can function with any other language. /ENDPOST/

learning the inner workings of ethereum and the various level 2 blockchains. with such a vast array of platforms out there it is hard to know where to start when approaching the ecosystem. from the outside looking in sol, polkadot, and cosmos seem like really interesting projects worth spending some time with, but i am curious what guys see as the most viable long term.i'm not too worried about the languages used for implementation, as i have had experience programming in multiple iterations of c++,  c#, java, and vb throughout my career. i am primarily concerned with finding a project that has an intuitive sdk and a strong developer community.  if you have had any experience building dapps i would like to hear about your recommendations for starting out with them as well.  any advice or personal preferences are welcome. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ this is my third post. the first two didn't go so well with most people not taking it very serious. i'd like to point out that since my first post casper has gone up a good amount. it has also gone up a good amount while the market has been down a considerable amount.here's my previous posts -here's a brief summary of why some people are very bullish on casper -one of the main guys at eth3reum was helping casper. big controversy came up over that. eth3reum had a scalability issue. they had a choice. either scrap eth3reum and start over or try to fix it which is almost an impossible task. they chose to keep it because their ecosystem is so big.casper has a guy who figured out how to fix the scalability issue. they use the same protocol as eth3reum which is why they like to say they are eth3reum 3.0. basically what eth3reum wants to eventually get to. the problem is eth3reum is having issues even with 2.0. it's going to be very difficult for eth3reum to fix these issues if not impossible. unfortunately for them they have obligations to early investors to not scrap it and start over.casper won't have scalability issues. they will even have predictable gas fees that you can set up. the team they assembled is impressive. this is a small cap ready to explode. only reason it hadn't yet was they were releasing a crap load of tokens to early investors the last few months. the token release has slowed since last month which is why the price is no longer being held back. there's been a lot of buzz recently from popular analysts predicting big gains and the token release had been holding this pent up interest down. now that the huge token release is over we are now seeing the price jump. this will be a top 20 asset one day. /ENDPOST/ ### hello, my friends!  this list features free-to-play crypto earning games for mobile (most of these titles should be either in the play or app store, or available in-browser on

[**binemon**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binemon)**, a pokemon-inspired crypto game, combines multiple elements, including collectibles, gacha, rpg, adventure, into one

maps and 100 levels to complete new challenges. in addition, players can earn the sparkpoint token to buy boosters to burst bubbles faster. the game is entirely free-to-play, although players will see advertisements regularly.### cryptopop - www.cryptopopcoin.comcryptopop is one of the best crypto mobile games for its simplicity. the game works essentially just like a candy-crush game. you can pop the bubbles to get some crypto. the more you pop, the more crypto youll receive. the game is a fun enough puzzler, and youre going to be able to do it without having to devote too much energy to it.the game will pay you out via coinbase, which is one of the safer crypto exchanges around at the moment. you can easily send it over to a wallet on another exchange following this. this is a blockchain game that pays out ethereum and popcoin, but they plan on expanding to other big tokens like litecoin and dash.### bitcoin bounce - https://thndr.gamesbitcoin bounce is a little different from a few of the others here, but it has a more direct system for rewarding you with crypto. rather than giving you a bit of crypto every once in a while, this app allows you to collect tickets to enter into a raffle for crypto at the end of each day. while this means you could not get any crypto as a prize, it could mean you get more. the game itself is a fairly simple platformer, youre just going to need to grab as many tickets as possible while moving from platform to platform.### bitcoin solitairebitcoin solitaire is one of the best crypto mobile games as it combines a game a lot of people like to play on phones with the ability to get bitcoin. this is a standard solitaire game but the faster you complete it, the more points you earn. you can then transfer these points into cryptocurrency via coinbase. this is a great game for mining crypto and it stands out from the crowd because of it.### crypto planet - https://cryptoplanet.gamecrypto planet adds a bit more gameplay other than just a small puzzler. this blockchain game has you explore a crypto planet and mine crystals. like other mobile games, this is one that is reliant on you letting time pass. you leave the digger running on a crystal for a few hours and return to collect your crystals. the more crystals you mine, the more space chests you can buy. these are the things you can actually get cryptocurrency in.this blockchain game has an in-game wallet where your coins are stored, but your crypto can then be moved to any other wallet. bitcoin bounce works well as it has different gameplay, and is very flexible on how you want to receive your crypto.### alien run - www.alienrun.comalien run deserves a spot on the best crypto games list for having a pretty different style of gameplay. in this game, you run through levels of platforming, like a traditional 2d side scroller. every five levels you complete can earn you a fraction of bitcoin! there are loads of levels here too, so you can earn quite a bit as you progress.unlike the previous titles, this game is pretty engaging and needs your active input a bit more. if you are not into solitaire or tile matching games, then this one is the right choice for you.### bitcoin pop - https://m.apkpure.combitcoin pop is a very similar game to crypto pop, but it is worth mentioning separately as it does have a different crypto on offer. this one will allow you to redeem bitcoin rather than other cryptos. however, given the high value of bitcoin it would take an excessively long time to get any amount enough worth transferring to your wallet. most bitcoin games here will only pay out small amounts of satoshis, but they do add up if you have an awful lot of patience.&amp;#x200b;please help me out by correcting any errors / omissions i might have made so that we can keep this fruitful for all members!  thank you again for your time, i hope we all moon asap! /ENDPOST/ hello all.so, the euphoria app  ([https://app.euphoria.money/#/stake](https://app.euphoria.money/#/stake)) offers crazy apy for staking wagmi (over 700.000%!!!). i cannot understand how this is possible, and something i know is that, if something looks too good to be true, it probably is.if i got this correctly, the stakers will have to maintain their staking for over 1 years in order to keep their benefits. that is okay, however, if the apy is maintained, every 1000usd invested will become millions of dollars after just a month! that's crazy, so i'm certain there is something in there i didn't quite understand.so... care to explain me what am i missing?thanks in advance. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ #libcoin-ieothe genesis allocation shown above will only be released over time.-all token except the ones offered in the ieo have a vesting scedule, ranging from 3 months to 3years.the circulation schedule below shows the maximum possible token supply that can be in circulation at any given time, which doest mean that all of those tokens will actually be on the market. for instance, a significant portion of the token supply is expected to be locked in the staking contract as soon as the govermance

dead. then we have the eth gas issues, apparently spending over $150 to mint a free nft is perfectly acceptable since eth gas fees will be fixed in a year or two. buy more eth, eth good, eth better than bitcoin.....am i the only one who is actually doing well by not listening to the majority of posts in this sub? i've made so much more on cardano, pancakeswap and most recently cro and vvs on cronos. while i do hold a bit of eth, it's all staked on an exchange right now because the gas fees are too much to do anything with it. this sub seems to be an eth cult where the more you pump eth the more popular you are. i'll keep using the blockchains and coins that don't expect me to waste profit on gas fees. /ENDPOST/ you know the saying: only afford what you can loose.but who here only invest what he can truly loose? does anyone do that anyway? i dont speak of loosing some, maybe survive the 10% dip for a week.i mean 100%, everything. to zero, nada, nil. your coins are lost, you got rugpulled, crypto just breaks.your portfolio is gone, reduced to atoms.i certainly cant. i probably not gonna starve, i certainly will not declare bankruptcy, but it would hurt *a lot.*so i surely cant "afford to loose everything".maybe we should change it to: "prepare to loose a big chunk of your money" ? wouldnt that be closer to the truth?nobody is actually prepared to loose *everything*. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ hey everyone.just wanted your  expertise in one things in the crypto world.im pretty new too the whole thing. and i have about 4 coins that im planning on holding with  dimon hand, as i believe in them long term.wanted too know where you go too find out about coins that haven't being released yet.how do you jump on bored with them, as i wanted to keep a eye out on some.i understand this part is more just gambling witch im happy too do, but more, get in, get out, and take my quick money if i make some.cheeres in advance. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ last week, as news of a new covid variant (omnicron) began to spread bitcoin dropped almost 10%. the rest of the crypto market followed.headlines ran blaming virus fears and the stock market slump (from virus fears) for the crypto crash  it wasnt a crash.were skittish investors selling because they wanted to bunker down with their cold hard cash to defend against the zombie apocalypse? was it off-risk investors who saw u.s. treasury bill yields on the rise? was it over-leveraged traders being liquidated (again)?fact is no one knows and it doesnt matter.markets dont go up in a straight line. they often dont behave rationally. and there will be more dips for any number of reasons. if dips cause panic, maybe rebalance risk.there are no guarantees, and thats fine too.meanwhile, the crypto market is recovering as omnicron is detected in even more countries. go figure. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ flair not: im not

3080 after month of just staying far away from it. i didnt have much interest in it until i learned how profitable it was. my hashrate stands at about 90 with about 380kh/j efficiency.&amp;#x200b;i currently have around $150 in a wallet on nicehash. as much as i would love to just watch it grow, i do need to take out some of it to pay for the power it is eating up, and also some spending money would be nice. now to my question.as a minor, i cannot make a coinbase account. my idea was using my parents or a relative as a medium. my main question is what is the legally of this, and what are the tax implications surrounding it. and also, would i even want to use my parents as a medium because of the tax bracket they may be in. not trying to be fraudulent in the slightest here, i'm not looking for some scummy workaround, i just want to sell my coin. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ not my discovery but i saw someone posted this on twitter and the

derived a simple strategy that will maybe help you to monitor the project you want to phase out.currently there was a lot of fud about ada, justified or not, i'm uncomfortable with the performance of the project.ada is currently 9% of my portfolio so i won't put more than 9% of my dca allocation in ada. i'm not doing this for every project, some have a fixed allocation and other will be monitored with this declining allocation.i'll keep the money to feed the btc allocation.&amp;#x200b;tldr: don't dca more than what a project represent in your portfolio if you think it is under-performing and will maybe not get you good returns. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ fear. uncertainty. doubt. all things that strike terror in the hearts of many investors. the

appeal of nft games from the developer's point of view. why would a f2p game go nft apart from hype resulting in lower cpi's?pay to earn concept isn't new and in many ways it has been a thing in different games.entropia universe is the first thing that comes to my mind, where players could play and earn money. the game was basically a very sophisticated slot machine with decent gameplay.also every big mmorpg/game with trading has a black market build around it, allowing players to play and earn, not legal and safe, but still.and if we look for example at any f2p gacha game - the player needs to waste a lot of rolls and money to get a good hero, why would a dev want to let the player sell it for real money and miss the opportunity to earn more from the buying player?what am i missing? /ENDPOST/ stop complaining about how rich people control the world. and stop acting like theyre aliens while we are just little slaves that do their bidding. whales are competing against each

and other digital assets will wrench global financial power from the hands of big banks, right back into the hands of the masses. regulation implies the exact opposite. therefore, all regulation is bad and a sure way to kill the industry. is this necessarily the case?**interest in crypto**after its meteoric rise in late 2017, it seemed bitcoin (and altcoins like xrp and ethereum) had exploded into the public consciousness as the zeitgeist technology for the foreseeable future. then followed the gloom of 2018, where the brutal bear market led many analysts to sound the death knell for the crypto industry.now, 2 years later, research shows that while the rumors of bitcoins death have been greatly exaggerated at times, its not out of the water just yet.a google trends search for bitcoin shows a dramatic drop in bitcoin-related searches by the first half of 2018. despite bitcoins surge in 2019 from $4,000 to over $12,000 at one stage, this has not translated into dramatically stirring interest back up. whichever way you want to spin it, this lack of interest in bitcoin does not bode well for the crypto industry and is a clear indication that it may be fading into irrelevancy.**regulation = regular**while most people attribute the 2008 bank crash to the greed and negligence of big banks, the truth is a little more complicated, and indeed has more to do with [unregulated loopholes](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/timothy-massad-its-time-to-strengthen-the-regulation-of-crypto-assets-2.pdf) that those in power exploited, according to timothy masad, ex-chairman of the commodity futures trading commission (cftc):&gt;*what some bitcoin enthusiasts fail to distinguish is that a primary cause of the global financial crisis was the growth of financial intermediation outside our traditional regulatory framework, rather than the mere existence of intermediation. non-bank mortgage originators, securitization, derivatives, and the government-sponsored enterprises all contributed to dramatic growth in mortgage lending outside of traditional banks there was, in short, no prudential regulation of the so-called shadow banking sector.*regulation = regular. its the antithesis of the chaos that virtual assets initially thrived in, and now seem to be bogged down by. regulations establish order so that a system can function more consistently, safely, with mostly predictable outcomes.this means that in a more controllable environment, cryptocurrencies can be seen as a normal, less volatile risk that can be managed with sophisticated technology and have better protection.**why and how can regulations benefit the crypto industry?**1. regulation creates binary virtual asset ownership2. regulation makes virtual assets easy to categorize and understand3. regulation gives fis green light to invest4. regulation puts an accurate valuation on a cryptocurrencys worth5. regulations will help transform cryptocurrency from purely speculative to usable assets6. regulation will make virtual asset ownership more secure7. regulation encourages investment into research and development8. regulation improves the efficiency of virtual asset tradingand most importantly:the stakes and rules are therefore very clear. **regulators are the gatekeepers to mass adoption.** if we want the crypto industry to keep growing and prosper, we need to ensure that a significant portion of the worlds population has access to and faith in it. to make this a reality, virtual assets like bitcoin must be viewed as secure, easy-to-use and readily available globally."source:

community shouldn't try and avoid regulation, but we should push for regulation that benefits us as early crypto adopters and subsequently makes it safer. i understand that this might be a scary prospect, as governments around the world are unsure of what to do with this emerging financial market, but there is also hopium: el salvador being the leader in mass adoption and now germany's new government eying crypto adoption and regulation.this can be a make or break moment, but i believe with the right ideas behind it, this has the potential to finally put crypto on the map for all and help the market. /ENDPOST/ wanted to share a scam that an indian crypto exchange wazirx is running. this morning i wake up to my funds randomly locked by the company with absolutely zero explanation.i

to be generating real revenue (ie. providing real economic value) from which the returns are distributed up and down the chain. who is that entity? for instance, when my bank gives me a rate of interest on my savings account of 1%, they take my money and lend it to a corporation at 2%. the corporations then uses the money to buy equipment and hire people to increase its revenue and profits by 5%. it is this corporation's ability to generate additional profits using the money it borrowed than enables the bank to provide a 1% interest on my savings account.for example [crpyto.com](https://crpyto.com), staking usdc with apy 12%, pay in usdc, but if you want to borrow usdc, you dont need to pay 12% interest in most of time. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed]

transparency repeatedly shown by those whom elevate themselves above the general public?what makes crypto attractive to you? /ENDPOST/ [removed][view poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/r4we2h) /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ i have been glued to my phone ever since i have started buying crypto. crypto isn't stable and we absolutely love it. the very fact that every time we open the app and crypto prices are not where  where they were when you last checked gives you a motivation to check it often.but most of us are long term hodlers. having an anxiety of short term price change is of no use if you are not going to sell. here's how you fix this:&amp;#x200b;**every time you have the urge to check crypto, do 15 pushups before.**make this a binding covenant. you **have** to do 15 pushups before you check your portfolio.(of course, you can decide the number of pushups according to how much you want; for me, 15 is enough)either of two things will happen:1. you will do way more pushups than you usually do.2. you'll stop checking your portfolio often, because you don't want to do the pushups.for anyone interested, this is called the *premack's principle*: an opportunity to engage in more probable behaviors (checking crypto prices/portfolio) will reinforce less probable behaviors (doing pushups).this will be your version of *proof of work ;)* /ENDPOST/

too much for some. they'll also face themselves on the journey. some will feel lucky, some won't even care... everybody has their own thing in their mind.and still, you'll witness many will throw away

newest variant of covid-19.background: on friday, a new variant of concern was identified in south africa. the price of most cryptos dropped 10% on the news. the world health organization named the new variant "omicron."details: coincidentally, there was a new crypto that launched earlier in november that also called itself omicron. it is a decentralized reserve currency protocol available on the arbitrum network, according to the documentation, and it is not a stablecoin.numbers: on saturday, one omicron coin was worth about $65. by sunday, the price jumped to over $620.final thoughts: while omicrons rise has been incredible, it is clear that this may be more of a volatile meme coin at the moment.hope you enjoyed this commentary. please subscribe to early bird, a free daily

like that to work, but there's tons of people on youtube or twitter drawing lines and what not and pretending to know exactly what the market's gonna do, heard stuff like we're pumping after thanksgiving because it happened in 2017, or if the eth/btc chat breaks this line we're inmediately going to the moon like that's a fact...don't get me wrong charts are very useful when trying to read the sentiment of the market and you could make some good calls by following it, but trying to affirm that you know exactly what's going to happen because the eth chart looks kinda similar to that of the btc in 2017 it's just bullshitnobody knows exactly what's going to happen guys, so stop believing everything you see on youtube, just because the guy uses funny words and draws a bunch of lines doesn't mean he knows what's going to happen. he's probably just baiting to get some views smh /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ every now and then, i see posts making their way on this subreddit saying "buying at ath is fine cause long term". although i understand and agree with this philosophy, i gotta say it should not be used to convince newcomers to invest. here's why:1: newcomers main concern is not losing their money. crypto takes time to understand and is not a conventional way of investing, which is why many invest in it not knowing entirely what they're doing.2: ath never last. which is why it will inevitably drop, sometimes for more than a month. newcomers are not accustomed to the volatility of the market, it often takes time and experience before you get used to it. which is why they often get "weak hands" and sell at a loss thinking they're about to lose their investment. it is understandable.3: again, ath never last. fomo gets the best of us but reality is: it's rarely the last time prices drop to x amount. which is why patience is often the key to buying at the right price. this is something newcomers should understand rather than being told "btc to the moon, 100k by the end of 2021 invest quick!!!"4: dca is king when it comes to reducing risks. the only advice i tell every newcomer asking me about crypto and strategy is: dca and don't fomo at ath.now, i'm not saying buying at ath is wrong. i sometimes do it myself to but only when i already have a good position with that asset.speaking from experience, all the newcomers i've personally seen investing at ath sold at a loss and it left them with a bad impression of crypto in general. which isn't what this community wants. /ENDPOST/ a lot of people are sceptic about cryptocurrency because they do not understand the technology behind it. people argue that the complex concept behind cryptocurrency and blockchain might be a hindrance for its mass adoption.i argue against it. i believe that you dont have to fully understand something to implement it in your life.moneyhow is money created? how is it distributed? who makes sure the right amount of money is printed? can't they just print trillions of dollar to solve poverty? what determines a healthy economy? what gives money its value? and so on...we all use money and these are basic questions related to money but i believe only few people have in-depth understanding regarding money to proficiently answer these questions.websiteshow is a website built? how is a website hosted? how do websites store our data? how do some websites crash? and so on...we all use different websites. however, very few have the right knowledge to explain them thoroughly.wifiwhat is the fullform of wifi? how are 2 computers in 2 different countries connected through wifi? what does weak and good wifi signal mean? what is the difference between wifi and internet? and so on...wifi is everywhere. but, a selected few would be able to answer these questions accurately.my whole point is not everything that we use we fully understand. so, crypto does not deserve the hate it often gets. the sceptisism is also valid but that i believe is because we are still early. because i believe in the next decade, cryptocurrency and blockchain are going to be fundamental to how we do things and progress in this technological era.what are your thoughts? what is holding crypto back? what can we see increasing mass adoption? /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ hi, i'm looking for a crypto offering high staking rewards which has a positive future outlook. if there is any please list them, would appreciate if you also say why it's good. i have been using plentydefi which is build on tezos, it's paying 84% apr but the price is absolutely garbage and has been hammered soo much, so i want to get out and looking for alternatives that have at least something positive going on for them.there are so many coins, i don't know where to start. i do hope there are some coins out there you guys maybe know about with high apr% and a more stable price than going down hundreds of % /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ something that  really needs to be looked at and revised is staking rewards, and token  reflections, regarding taxes. token reflections are so new, that the irs  hasn't even mentioned them. from what i have gathered, people are  saying to treat reflections as income. this is not fair because lets  think about this hypothetical scenario, using the turbotax taxcaster caluclator: a "hodler" in the usa is a  single person with no dependents and has a low paying job. they were paid  $25k a year from that job. this person also received $100k in reflections or staking rewards given in the form of the token they were holding, which is  valued at $100k for the tax year due to the time at which the token was  worth when they acquired it. currently the irs would consider that $100k  as **misc./other** **income**. the token crashes in value, and they sell all  the tokens that the irs sees as $100k in **income**. they sell all these  tokens for $10k. they had a capital loss of $90k, as they have been  taxed for the $100k as **income**. you can only offset and claim capital  losses of $3k a year. this low income person now owes the irs $20,289,  all because the reflections/staking rewards were categorized as **income**.  staking rewards and reflections should not be taxed as income, and  should only be taxed when they are sold. the cost basis should be $0. so  if this same scenario happened, this person would only owe taxes on the  $10k, the amount that they profited! /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ with so many news about projects being shared every day, i'm curios if anyone has a birds eye perspective on this. which blockchain / crypto team has been outperforming themselves? (and, who has not done so well). is there a summary anywhere?i'm keen to invest more in crypto, and an important element for me is also to back the team. a judgement on their execution ability says a lot and is worth noticing.i'm looking only at the last 2 years because it seems that many projects got quite serious then so i'm keen to see the progress since then.would appreciate any insights that anyone has. even it is personal insights. thanks /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed][view poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/r4vik5) /ENDPOST/ just because a govt cant control a growing market,it should not be the only reason to try to put a full stop to a rapidly growing industry.i.e. cryptopersonally i am of the opinion that all these efforts to stop crypto from growing by bringing new laws and regulations would be fruitless.this is the beauty of decentralisation.today i found out that, india has more crypto investors than the people actively invest in stock markets.100million people actively investing in crypto while 70 million in stock markets.the number is really impressive for just a decade old industry,while stock markets are very old.indian people are not famous for investing in stocks.but they are actively involved in crypto.i would say people really see crypto as a hope to have better life.,they might not aware of the technology but with time it will improve too.when you have population of over 1.3bn and less than 10% people pay taxes, then govt could have seen the advantages crypto can serve,one advantage would be to increase the govt's tax collection by taxing the gains from crypto,and just by making crypto friendly policies.imo,govt is really ignoring an opportunity to capitalize on because they can't control it., have any say in how it works.100 million is not a small number in any way.so many nations have less population than 100mn.(source for crypto investors number)

[removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ things are changing rapidly in crypto, today even faster than before. predicting which assests will emerge and be used by the masses before the majority is the way to make those infinite gains.obviously the first pick ever was bitcoin itself.then we had an era, first major bull, with tons of shitcoins promising to be a better bitcoin. people speculated and gambled on those.then we had an era of "eth killers" and general ico craziness, everyone tried to make quick buck of those. some of icos were great and those projects are here with us today leaving their starting prices by a mile. of course, faaaar more icos were a disaster, money grab and fails.then there was this period of aping into all sorts of defi left and right. again some succeded and more of them were just rug pulls.after that the nft craze came along, people buying all kinds of shit hoping it will be the next most wanted thing everyone else wants. nfts are still popular but aren't so much talked about because...we are now in the metaverse/gaming hype. people are now aping into anything that has "meta" in it's name. find a trash can and call it metatrash, you'll see money pouring into it. same with games, tons of money flowing into things that aren't even in alpha testing. again, some will succed tons will fail.but what is the next thing you think people will get hyped about and will ape into it without any thinking?short term i think daos are next or some kind of social media thing. maybe virtual reality projects in the future. /ENDPOST/ so i recently joined this sub and a few others to get to know more of cryptocurrencies and just for an overall "get to know each other", me and crypto.after reading so many posts, different opinions and various point of views i have to say i really do like this sub and everything going on here. all this mood swings, the hype and fear, the shared knowledge and everyone coming together to talk about something with an actual possibility to move the world.i sometimes think about the phrasing "too late to explore earth and to early to explore space" but i just can't stop thinking about that we truly live in interesting times and with the possibilities of cryptocurrencies in the future i think we live quite in a fitting time to be (not the early early adopters but) the spearhead of our time.just my thoughts i wanted to share.cheers! /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ in crypto it is said that whales are the one that move the market. however this doesnt mean theres a single shadowy guy or a group of people secretly plotting to manipulate the market to their benefit. its easy to have this simplistic view of the market but in reality the market behaves in complex ways that nobody knows what factory whats going on, hence the random volatility were seeing.instead the market is more complicated then that, with multiple whales competing with each other. even though its true a single whale can move the market a little bit, usually what happens is other whales react as well, either reinforcing the movements or going against it.for example, whale a bought a bag of bitcoin driving price up by 1%, 3 other whales saw this pump and bought their bags as well, causing bitcoin price to go up more, leading to more whale, along with us small fishes buying up more, creating a feedback loop to drive the price up until some whale decide to cash in on this price hike.lets not forget algorithmic trading as well. just like in stock where there are algorithms set up to react within nanoseconds a positive or negative news coverage, i would not be surprise if this is deployed in crypto seeing how prices overreact to news sometimes.what does this mean for daily average investors then? its simple, ignore the short term volatility with the prices and focus on long term solid projects. fundamentally what drives crypto prices is mass adoption. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ reflections are probably not new to you. the idea of buying into a token of this type can seem unflattering.imagine you could earn dividends on the crypto your invested in.through volume farming all hodlers will earn rewards in the form of similar tokens which in turn earns you even more profits.the token is new less than two weeks. the current market hasnt done it n e favors but the potential of this coin   (no crypto is complete without rockets and moons.)im not telling

why i was thinking of making a bitcoin cash version if there was a demand for it.i could put it together in a few days if there was interest.on the website would be 1 000 000 pixels advertising space available.1 000 000 pixels = 1 bchminimum order would be 10\*10 pixels = 0.0001 bchthe ads would be available while the website is still live.the proceeds would be used to maintain the website.i would only need to buy the domain address, so the website would be long-lived.what do you think of the idea? /ENDPOST/ i'm at the point in my crypto journey where i have made thousands of trades, and i worry that i'm going to eventually lose track of it the deeper into the rabbit hole i go. with tax time still quite a while away, i want to start putting a bit more effort into tracking my dates of purchase, buy prices, sell prices etc.as i use multiple exchanges, it can be difficult to check how much my average buy price is on a coin, or how much i'm down or up in total. i know it will be a lot of work to go back over the last few months and i'm willing to put the work in over a few weekends. once that's done, all i'd need to do is log each trade as i make them - and ultimately this will help me come tax time.i am dreadful at using excel, but i was wondering if perhaps there was a generic spreadsheet or someone could make their template available to help not only me, but i'm sure many other users begin to keep track of our trading.what tools do you use on the day to day to keep track of your folio? /ENDPOST/ you gonna need at least 3 or 4 bull markets to get your crypto goalfirst one you enter too late and make some loss. you probably heard about people making crazy returns on the news or from some of your friends and get very excited about the crypto world.second one youre still greedy and inexperienced. probably take profits too early or wait till its too late, dont know how to recognise a top or sub tops.third one you already enter with loaded bags from a bear market and take healthy profits along the way. you realise when the market is cooling off and exit accordingly.time in the market its everything to be wealthy in crypto world. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/

(probably) going to be wrong. not because i enjoy seeing people smarter than me be wrong about something but because of the healthy skepticism of predictions that this community very much needs. we all know the proverbial story of a dart throwing monkey who has a better prediction track record than experts. when it comes to predicting political events or economic forecasts, people accept that even the most qualified expert is not guaranteed to be right and often is not so its not a bad thing if the same holds true for making predictions about the crypto market. plus, its kind of ironic that a movement which emphasizes decentralization and individual autonomy takes so many peoples forecasts as gospel truth /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ new to crypto and looking at

has it any big name investors, good team working behind it? what's the bad points has it had any vulnerabilities bad news attached etc? saying its crap or its great isn't really an answer give your reasons why?thanks for all the advise i've received on other projects i've been able to take this away then do my own research. i've avoided a fair few bad eggs, but also discovered some awesome projects at the same time /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ i've been investing just a little each week in crypto currency since 8 months. the currency of my country is quite weak against usdt and buying usdt over p2p has been expensive (the official banking system on my country doesn't work on crypto exchanges), but i always had the hope one day crypto will make me rich and i'll be able to use that extra income for experiences i've never had.however, since the last 8 months of investing, maybe due to the volatility, maybe because of my poor research and terrible strategy, i've lost about 30% of  my hard earned money in cryptolast evening i put some money in btc-usdt futures and slept off, when i woke i had made 90 usdt- which i used to fund sand-usdt futures, since sand was rising. i was so excited, i had earned some money the first time ever with crypto! with sand-usdt futures, i lost not only what i earned overnight but also an additional 70 usdt from my futures account.i feel so angry and pissed at myself. i should have quit while i was winning, should have invested those 90 usdt in a nice metaverse coin, done better research and made money on swings.i've been sad all day. i know it was not money i needed immediately, i know it was my gamble money kept aside, i know $90 might be a small amount for those from richer countries, but i feel so demoralised investing in crypto now. /ENDPOST/ so many of us woke up the morning of black friday shocked to see markets had tanked. thanksgiving was a decent day and some likely even expected a little crypto spike based on people telling their uncles, cousins and maw maws to buy some bitcoin. most of us however were shocked to wake up to markets down substantially and the media took the opportunity to spew out a bunch of articles about how bitcoin was entering a bear market and how stocks and futures were fearful about this oh so terrible variant.here's the thing, the media is bullshit, they don't give the news they're essentially tabloits trying to get clicks through shock and awe, fear, or divisiveness.here's the thing about the omicron, it's not new, this variant has been around in germany, new zealand and other countries for months. as far as why south africa sequenced it first, no south africa isn't a dangerous country, they have one of the most advanced healthcare systems in the world when it comes to pathogens and diseases because africa deals with things like ebola and other diseases.also, while we don't know a ton about this variant yet, from what were hearing from medical professionals it leads to mild cases and from what we know about diseases in general they tend to get more transmittable but weaker with time.so why did crypto crash? was it following the stock market? was it based on uncertainty? was it whales taking an opportunity to drive the market lower to enhnace their positions?here's what it really comes down to markets hate uncertainty and while it's fairly certain omicron is a nothing burger, wall street doesn't know how people, governments or politicains will react to it so that caused stocks to dip lower and for whatever reason crypto followed.i think the fear here is that all it takes is one straw to break the camels back and this may have just been that straw to knock down an already over inflated stock market and overdue bull run, that's the fear and there is and was a small chance of that happening. with investing however we looks at odds and odds are this is a big nothing and a great chance to buy the fucking dip.wev're already seeing a market recovery, i think it will be slow and tempured and not a shot back up to all time highs but we will see a steady growth back there. you're not too late to take advantage of black friday sales, heck it's cyber monday. /ENDPOST/ https://imgur.com/a/umutndqhi fellow cryptonauts,have you ever needed to send or receive money abroad ?yeah, for a lot of people like me who emigrated to a richer country and send money to family, western union is the go to solution. however the fees are to damn high.i'm currently living in france for studies (i've got a scholarship). i'm earning a small amount of fiat () in my internship. i'm in a position where my 100 can help a lot my parents back home.however, the problem with western union is that you have to pay 4% in fees and then 30% in taxes. in addition in argentina you have two prices of american dollars ($):- the official price set my the gouvernement- and the street price that is double the oficial one.if you have never heard about it, yes it sounds insane but that's how things are back there.so the 100 that i send to argentina is worth just a fraction after :- wu's fees,- 50% is lost to the official exchange dolar/euro value- and 30% to taxes for the receiverwe just get fucked by all sides.. we get rekt.#the solution to this problem.obviously i'm talking about crypto, more expecially btc.that's how i've done it.1) i've bought 0.002 btc (~100) in cb pro2) i have an university college/friend (let's call him diego) that is buying btc to save up money and fight inflation. i just send him the btc to his wallet and he goes to my parents house and gives the money (local fiat) in person at the price of the btc-fiat.  yes it's a system based on trust..3) and voil. done. my parents receive money right at the doorstep. no taxes involved.i know that this is an "illegal" activity in the eyes of the argentinian gouvernement but i don't give a fuck. i'm helping my family and that is worth for me.the only thing that i'm concerned are the taxes in france. i don't want to do shaddy things here because i don't mind paying 30% in capital gains when i sell crypto-fiat.i have confidence in the french system and i want to stay here. when i'll fill my taxes,  i can just state the btc sent as a gift (because indeed i'm gifting crypto to my parents).take in mind that this was my first time sending btc for fiat. there may be cheaper ways, so i'm open to suggestions. i need to learn about the lighting network and find another p2p method.thanks for the read,have a good one and take care of your family and friends /ENDPOST/ [removed]

worthwhile to delve a little deeper into this. the industry is changing so quickly that it's easy to overlook the fundamentals of what makes up a cryptocurrency unless you're trading on a daily basis or working in the industry.there are numerous nuances that an individual must understand before entering the market. the market is rife with complex technical terminologies and concepts that are incomprehensible to the average joe. any seasoned investor in traditional markets  bonds, commodities, foreign exchange, or otherwise  will tell you that familiarity and understanding of the market they're in is critical to success.the cryptocurrency market is no exception. in a market filled with extreme sentiment and volatility, revisiting basic concepts can truly help you strengthen your market edge and manage your risks.due to their infancy and speculative appeal, cryptocurrencies are a highly risky asset class. investing in a cryptocurrency project entails 'betting' on the venture's success by evaluating various factors such as the strength of the team, the viability of the project, the achievability of the roadmap, the utility of the tokens, and many more. if we were successful, we would be ecstatic about the returns on our investment.the environment is changing. regulation is on its way. and, yes, there will be more trends  securitized tokens, for example.1. do your dd2. understand crypto /ENDPOST/ good morning everyone i have recently had an ar based gaming app developed for by a company in the us, as we want to keep control of the ios &amp; android developer accounts we need help from a developer locally who can assist with the final stages of the developer account creation, (most notably the creation of the games certificates / keys) and then launch the game for us. this may lead to further collaboration as we have plans to develop a crypto currency linked to the game. can anyone help or recommend someone. we are located in london. /ENDPOST/

give to those new investors out there right now?as new investors, there will be many that are kicking off their shoes and wanting to know the first steps to the blockchain system. some may even ask if bitcoin is currently a bubble... is it too late to buy right now...i just want to let the new investor know that at ever bear market, there will always be a bull market. it is an endless cycle of perpetual balance like the yin and yang. i belive that even though it is currently dipping right now, crypto in general is far from finish and the path to investing stands stronger than ever.remember to always ignore the noise and do not believe everything that the media and reputable financial sector preach about them. both of them make loud voices as well as lots of noice. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ with the recent dip i've seen lots of posts saying that the new omicron variant is the reason for the dip. this is completely unrelated, just ask yourself, would you sell crypto because of a new covid variant? probably no, since you're not using it as a currency, and just holding it as an investment. stocks will go down of course, because the companies are directly losing money because of the new virus. but there's not much connecting real world events and crypto markets. moreover, fiat is the one who's going to suffer from this, it's going to cause inflation and even more people will invest in crypto to protect from it. what we're seeing now is just regular market movement. bitcoin went down 5% for 3 days and then went back. this is almost nothing, it's just a (coin)cidence that it happend shortly after the announcment of the new variant. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ royalcrypto.finance is a smart contract-based dapp built on the binance smart chain that allows users to invest in cryptocurrencies. it just live today. the objective is to get the most out of the binance smart chain without investing excessive amounts of time and resources on it.the binance smart chain (bsc) has experienced a surge in its blockchain activity, including token swaps, decentralized applications, non-financial tokens, and decentralized currency markets. one of the most beneficial aspects of the bsc is that it allows for cross-chain atomic exchanges while charging gas prices that are over 20 times cheaper than those charged by other chains.because of its proof-of-stake authority (posa), consensus may be used as a high-speed infrastructure, beneficial for defi applications. as a result, it is ideal for widespread adoption. moreover, bep-20 tokens provide borderless defi prospects because once a token is released on the binance smart chain, it may be readily transferred between several blockchains. it also contributes to the simplification of interoperability across the whole ecosystem.features of royal crypto:with their deposits in royalcrypto.finance, the users can expect to earn reliable daily returns ranging from 7.8 percent to 17 percent daily. the smart contract allows users to start with as little as 0.01 bnb to get their profits up. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/

sold almost all of my etfs and put it in to the 21shares crypto basket named hodl. i know not your keys not your crypto, but these etfs were on a so called long term investing account (its a hungarian thing) where you can put in money only in the first year and then if you dont take out money for 5 year, then you dont have to pay personal income tax for the profits which is now 15% in my country,i thought that im young i dont need that money now so if a crash comes then ill wait it out but if in 1-2 or more months it climbs back to its ath and sold the initial investment , then its good money.wish me good luck! /ENDPOST/ i was looking for play to earn games lately i started playing gods unchained its completely free which is nice but i don't know how to play cards games so i don't

(hopefully) a lot of you already know this. if so, sorry for bothering, only trying to help/ teach people that don't know yet.let's say one of your assets drops 30% and you think "it will easily recover 30% again". even if it does, it doesn't cover the losses you've made. that's because the value of your bag is smaller than it was and therefore needs to "overcompensate" the loss. this really isn't so interesting for lower %'s, but get's quite scary with higher %'s:&amp;#x200b;\-10% needs +11,1% for original value\-20% needs +25% for original value\-30% needs +42,9% for original value\-40% needs 66,7% for original value\-50% needs 100% for original value (!)\-60% needs 150% for original value (!)\-70% needs 333,3% for original value (!)\-80% needs 500% for original value (!)\-90% needs

now and want to start dcaing in.  some questions about strategy...how do you determine the frequency and timing of your dca? do you just pick a day of the week to dca in?  do you still react to price fluctuations and buy dips even if they don't happen on your dca dayand they for dcaing out when prices are high, where do you draw that line?  did you just pick a threshold and decide this is where i will stop dcaing in and start dcaing out? /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ i work in cybersec for 5 years as a threat detection engineer in mssp soc. i love my current type of work, but sometimes i think about what will be relevant in the future. currently, my work mainly includes reviewing threat intel, testing exploits/exploding malware, data analysis and finally development, deployment and tuning of detection rules. i also do a lot of automation using soar systems and sometimes ir.that said, i lack hands on experience with any type of hardening, code reviews, pentesting, patching, assessments etc.as you can tell, my role is very passive - working with data only. i am afraid vendors will become so good with detecting threats that my job will go obsolete. also a lot of job offerings require knowledge of directly preventing attacks, not just detecting them.what do you think, should i be worried about the future? ultimately, i want to become freelancer, but there is no demand for my skills, which makes sense because the role is very operational, and freelance gigs are often one time projects. /ENDPOST/ obligatory nfa.btc/usdt pair 29-11-20211) weekly: btc continues to consolidate after a dip into 53,2k. rising volume and macd in bull suggest further recovery until ma7 (60,6 k), where it will encounter strong resistance.2) daily: after strong bearish action three days ago, and bottoming out on ma99 with 53.25k as the low point, btc has reclaimed ma7 (56.6k) as support, tested it, and is currently fighting resistance on 8-hr timeframe (ma199 at 57.5k). daily shows a falling volume, macd in weakening bear, and a clear ceiling with an ma25/ma50 death cross, which suggests more support tests will happen within the upcoming days. based on daily, there are two plausible channels at the time of writing: 56.6 - 60.7k (the bull channel) and 46 - 54.2k (the bear channel).based on daily, the most plausible channel for the upcoming 72 hours is 54,2k - 60,8k.3) 8-hr chart: btc has lost the 8-hr support on ma199 and after ma99 test on daily bounced to the nearest strong resistance, where it was rejected. it found support on ma25 on 8-hr chart and is currenty recovering. on the short-term, it is highly plausible btc will attempt another attack on resistance, and will get rejected on ma99 on the 4-hr chart (58,7k). the dip that follows rejection may take it to ma99 on hourly (55.7k)most plausible 12-hr scenario: bullish attack on 58,7k and support test on 55.7k.[daily

same as april's doji red candle, that would be a bear sign. healthy correction was needed.https://preview.redd.it/myox3oohsi281.png?width=941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=565e8509df0107547be3cddb80d815ee717d63ac&amp;#x200b;last april was the end of the bull run with a nice clear red doji candle announcing the trend had ended.doji candle is used to predict reverses in a trend, so if you look at the june doji candle was also another candle announcing the reverse of a bear trend.btc needs to close this month at this price or lower to avoid creating another red doji candle. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ so this weekend i finally went out partying with my friends after a prolonged break (yes i am double vaccinated and getting my booster next month). anyway, we went into a local club in which i had been multiple times before. after a couple hours and glasses of wine this group of well-dressed men (think of the american psycho business guys) invited us to their table after hearing us talk about crypto. now i am not an expert on the subject by any means, and neither are my friends, we were just discussing the most recent news about ada, xrp, doge and shib. these men, however, were very intrigued to hear about our opinions on the matter and what we thought were good investments. they seemed very well off, buying us drinks like it was nothing and promising to give us all multiple bitcoins as long as we kept drinking with them, which i took as a joke (obviously).after drinking with these men in suits for a while, having held a long break from alcohol consumption, i blacked out. the next morning i laid on my bed in an abysmal hangover for what must have been like three hours, trying to recollect my memories from the night before. once i got up and walked into my kitchen i saw a polaroid picture on the table, right next to my keys and wallet. it depicted a person in a freaky sonic the hedgehog costume wearing a harry potter school uniform. he also had a barack obama mask on top of the sonic head and some freaky brownish thing coming out the back, a tail i suppose. i had absolutely no recollection of ever having possession of this polaroid picture and i had never seen that weird image before. i turned it around and on the back it just said check your metamask wallet sir. i didnt have a metamask wallet (i only use coinbase and binance), but upon checking my phone i found a metamask app.i opened the app and it says i own 100 000 000 000 bitcoin. well, i figured there is no way they are the actual, real bitcoins. after googling how the app works, i went ahead and checked the coin contract on a site called bscscan.com. the real name of the bitcoin is fucking harrypotterobamasonic10inu. harry. potter. obama. sonic. 10. inu. what the fuck is this? who the fuck gives people (god knows if i myself paid for this shit) bitcoins that in reality are some abomination of a shitcoin? is this even legal? does anyone here know how i can get rid of these bitcoins? do they even have value??? picture on my post is the polaroid i found on my table.https://preview.redd.it/oyjqw4npsi281.jpg?width=723&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8bed49758fb5565bfa7f4e390b8d0edccc162dc /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ there is no type of currency more fitting for transactions in the metaverse than cryptocurrencies. paying in fiat or any physical asset for that matter, would be a huge hassle, especially because it's current primary users don't even hold a majority of their assets in anything but digital assets like cryptocurrency. most of us have seen major news media post articles about axie infinity and decentraland plot sales, most recently there's been an article about the luxury yacht nft from the sandbox being sold and the value is always written in usd (650.000 usd in this case), but it was in actuality sold for 149 eth and not fiat.many smaller gamefi projects like risingsun, already have their own ecosystems set up with interchangeable tokens that can be used for purchases or at the internal marketplace or to act as enhancing multipliers in the games. everything is handled in crypto in these projects and there is no room or use for fiat. that is why i think that the gamefi crypto market which is already lightyears ahead in terms of setting up infrastructure compared to facebook's version of the metaverse and the gaming industry in general in terms of innovation, will have a vast impact on many aspects of the industry practices and standards in the future and i honestly don't see fiat implementation playing a big part in it.share your own thoughts below. /ENDPOST/ can i please get a big round of applause for all of you that were able to survive the recent bear market caused by covid-19 omicron. ([source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/11/26/crypto-bitcoin-btc-enters-bear-market-on-new-covid-variant.html)i absolutely am amazed by all of your persistence for surviving this extensive bear market of roughly 2,5 days. i know most people gave up. but you were here and stayed.respect to all the hodlers.now let's watch the market blow up to 100k$ btc.congratulations on surviving the bear market. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ as the titles suggests, im interested in discovering some new crypto orientated podcasts.my personal favourite (and most likely an obvious choice) is the bankless podcast.the only small issue i have with them, is that theyre very eth forward (which isnt necessarily a bad thing) but i wouldnt mind getting some exposure to various other different viewpoints as well!drop your favourite crypto native podcasts in the comments below!and also maybe drop some background information or a quick overview on what its all about to help people sort through what theyre looking forcheers legends! /ENDPOST/ so, one incredibly unique thing about this market is it is a global 24hr system. stock markets close, where crypto doesn't.after watching the black friday sales come and go it occurred to me there may be a correlation in what is being bought and sold in relation to where it is daytime and what events have and are occurring. christmas, eid, bank hollidays etc.an example being, the sell off as americans buy online and have their holiday is bought by the se asian players while the americans sleep.it is something that a money market has never seen before.... anyway just a thought. /ENDPOST/ i am a 16 yr old from india. i'd really like to know ways to earn crypto, not alot but enough to get started. i cannot convince my family to get into crypto. can you people tell me different ways to earn some crypto that help me get started (0.5$-5$ /week).mind you i only have a mobile device, so mining and p2e games are sadly out of question. i've been looking into different project but have nothing to get into them with.it be great if i could find something that can help me get started. i've been looking cryptofaucets but after more than a month of constant grinding(+5hr daily) i've only made about ~0.4$. the amount of work i put in is not worth it. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ so i know wyckoffers get a beating for being absolute bears, but the truth couldn't be further.there is a theory behind market volatility at some points in time and an explanation to the moves we see in the market.there is no constantly bullish or bearish narrative, the wyckoff theory gies with the ups and downs.so getting this past us, there is the opinion (not so popular) that the feb-may action was the result of manipulation, specifically a textbook wyckoff distribution that started with a big rise, went on with boatloads of uncertainty and instantly shifting market sentiment.now i proposs that we are in the middle of a similar phase, judging from the sentiment this month (go check the fear and greed index, it's mad)and the price ups and downs looking almost identical to spring time.it doesn't seem like we've seen the top of this run yet, so there's still much time for green, but i think that we should keep the wyckoff distribution in mind and play carefully.im leaving [this link](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/btceur/infev6ef-rough-bull-bear-targets-in-wyckoff-scenario/) to an analysis that seems to play well, although it isn't particularly technical and is really rough, but i think it fits what we see.thank you for the attention if you read that far. may you only see green. /ENDPOST/ so we all know what happens when market goes -3% and fud posts flood this entire sub and vice versa after +4% there's posts "predicting" meme coins to flip btc.here's the reason why (in my humble opinion)so there some us who just hang out here (no matter the green or red day)but most of the users come and go depending on price and sentiment. as soon as market has correction and price goes down thousands (if not tens of thousands) of users rush on reddit to justify this "crash" and  let their anger and fears out.as soon as price goes up: they just leave. (until next time) and happy meme coin fun boys arrive with their "to the moon" shouts and screams.bit of a "no shit sherlock" post over here but what i'm trying to say is that we may not be as severely bipolar as it might appear. /ENDPOST/ green energy has many problems. first if very expensive, then it requires a big amount of land "adultery" to put the devices that produce itand considering the pos cryptos have proven that you might not need pow at all, means that electricity being used on crypto might be totally unnecessary, and it's an outright terrible way of wasting green energy that's hard to make.i'm totally not against pow, but pow cryptos only makes sense using nuclear energy (which i'm highly in favour of) where often you can produce more than what you can actually use and that energy could be diverted to crypto mining.nuclear energy is almost emission-free, it's safe and produces tons of energy. france for example has 57 nuclear plants, and often they even sell energy to neighbors.green energy is great, but only as a supplement, living 100% out of green energy is not a great idea, because human beings use too much of it. having our planet filled with acres and acres of wind mills, dams and solar farms isn't very green if you ask me.nuclear has residues that we have to dispose of, let's face it, the area of land needed to dispose of these resources is hundreds of times smaller than the are needed to fill with green energy sources. /ENDPOST/ hey guys, i hope youre doing amazing.crypto can be really stressful, and you can easily be caught up on the price checking mania. it happens to almost everyone i believe, and it can be unhealthy for your mental stability and health overall. even more when we are going through red days.but stay calm, take a deep breath, find things that can bring you up and put your mind out of stress. ive found many things that help a lot. like exercising, singing, studiying more and more about crypto and the history of money, and it can be an infinite amount of things that you can do. but first of all, you need to realize that crypto its not going to fail, this is the future, hands down. second you need to just stop checking the charts every 2 minutes, and then find something productive to do instead.so, what are you guys doing on these days, or how did you go out of the loop of chart checking? /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ a friend recommended me this new crypto app that let's you earn some coins through drawing on the screen. the concept seems gimicky but well thought, lmt uses human verification,  with the "excuse" of the human doing it creatively by drawing. at the end of the day, you can just spam lines with your finger and eventually get lmt's (actually the most profitable way), which makes me think it's also rather easy to turn into a bot.as i'm not very experienced with crypto in general, this sounds as a good idea that could turn into something big, as much as just a guy just trying to profit with a small app in the era of crypto-craze.do you think it has any future? /ENDPOST/ just my opinion. tether has a terrible image since the sec has questioned if every usdt is backed by a dollar because they keep it all in places like the cayman islands or somewhere with comparable financial rules.they might be investing that money elsewhere, which is extremely hazardous and would jeopardize the usdt's stability.even more significant is the fact that a second inquiry is ongoing, as well as some possible items involving evergrande debt, though i don't know much about that so dyor.we can no longer trust usdt since its entire point is being tied to exactly one united states dollar if tether does not back up every 1 usdt with a real dollar in its reserve. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ just 24 hours ago, people on this very sub were claiming that the bull run was over. the market was down quite far admittedly, but a great number of people were talking as if it was the apocalypse.now, we've had a small turnaround in btc and eth, which has caused a huge swing in sentiment. people are contemplating aths and are claiming the bull run is back on. the echo chamber nature of this subreddit causes all sentiment to be multiplied by ten, on the way down and the way up.my advice: don't pay much attention when the market is volatile. dyor for a diversified portfolio of fundamentally sound coins and tokens, so that you can ignore the cries of this subreddit and not make the mistake of buying high and selling low. /ENDPOST/ many coins have a lot of hype around them, high trading volume and a lot of shilling on this subreddit, but no actual purpose or great tech behind it.i think that the best example for that is **xlm (stellar)**. it's ridiculously cheap to use, and fast. and yet, it's not nearly as popular.another example of this would be xmr (monero). unlike other coins, monero has a non-traceable transaction history.**which other coins have great technological advantages that people simply not know enough about?** /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ we invest in projects solving real life problems with a product and a sustainable business/revenue model. nobody "invests" in an experiment.i see so many crypto projects worth multiple millions of dollars claiming to be "experiments" in blah blah... thus creating a backdoor or an excuse that they can fall back on when they eventually rug or scam you in some novel ways.afterall it was an "experiment". and we all know that experiments mostly fail until a conclusive model or solution is found.if they're running an experiment, then they should do it with their own or private investors money and wait until they have a conclusive business model before launching to the public.every project described as an experiment is a potential scam or at best a huge gamble on your part if you invest in them.if you decide to put any money into such projects just consider it gone forever until it returns. /ENDPOST/ i've seen a few posts lately saying airdrops aren't worth shit and you need to be super lucky.this is wrong.i'm specifically talking xrpl airdrops here as i haven't ventured into any other areas yet, but i have received a few nice ones, namely equilibrium games(eq) and elysian(els).these are not hard to get nor are they hidden, they are well advertised.there are 2 coming up vagabond and sologenic that should be good, but of course dyor.the reason i'm writing this is eq was .80c this morning, i got 5600 free a while back amd sold them at .18c.nice profit but should have been much better.so the advice is get the airdrops and hodl them.it's free money!!!! /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ these are genuine questions. i want to understand the project. there are so many projects at this point that i think it is healthy to have discussions about what competitive edge every project has over the existing ones.there is a lot of hype around avalanche but i can't understand what is exactly so special about it. is there anything that avalanche provides that ethereum or solana or binance smart chain or cardano doesn't already? what is avax's selling point exactly?isn't ethereum already addressing many of the issues avalanche is trying to address? maybe they're not implemented yet, but once they are implemented in ethereum then how exactly is avalanche going to compete?please change my mind, i really want to, but i honestly don't see solana or avalanche serious contenders for ethereum, the same way that cardano wasn't/isn't. i'm here to learn, so please discuss this with facts and don't turn this into a shilling thread because i'm really interested to understand the project. /ENDPOST/ i don't know about you guys, but todays market recovery feels super bullish. some people were expecting a further drop when the stock markets open up, but we recovered instead. after many ups and downs the last week the market as a whole seems resistant.there is no stopping this train now. at least not again until the next chinese new year and wall street bonuses. or am i just too high on hopium?i hope everyone had a chance to buy the dip now.this post was presented to you by my gut feelings. what are yours? /ENDPOST/ hello, everyone.i watched the rise of axia infinity happen without lifting a finger. i was busy with life, and now i regret that i didn't think i had an hour to spare now and then.but yesterday (yes, only yesterday, apparently i think very slowly) i realized there must be a bunch of other games based on similar principles. as far as i understand, theses games will probably be everywhere in a few years - so i'm asking you:**do you know of any games that are similar to axia infinity, but not as popular yet?** /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/radio-caca/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/radio-caca/) with 4.4m watchlists interest vs. 2.9m for btc how can anyone ignore this coin?! not much info around though...raca is the native token for the universal metaverse and the exclusive manager of maye musk mystery box nft. the universal metaverse (usm) is a 3d planet virtual world where users can own lands, build buildings such as stores and art galleries, create and play games. any further thoughts? /ENDPOST/ i got downvoted and berated for saying people should be wary in a post a couple of weeks ago. in hindsight i went over the top, my bad; lesson learned, but as it turned out things only went downwards from the euphoria of the middle of nov.this is not an 'i told you so', things could well have carried on upwards. i am just wary of all the china/india restrictions, the possibility of covid increases/market regulation/usa economy blah blah. there just seems such a lot of fud still around it can cause dips at any time. cryptos are marching on despite all of this and i want to be on board as much as anyone.just be ready for anything is what i would advise everyone. have a plan and stick to it. /ENDPOST/ hi,with the ever changing landscape of crypto and mindless shilling and bag holding i thought it would be a nice exercise to know cons of some coins which you might be interested in.i'm a cautious buyer and even though i believe in crypto i don't believe that large amount of coins which exist today will be able to survive in the long run. also, it is really hard to find negative aspects with the fear of bashing in this sub.hopefully, this will save people from investing into scamcoins and shitcoins. also, it can serve as one resource for your dd.i'll start off with a coin i'm interested in buying into at the moment. /ENDPOST/ just thought about how one of the best tips we like to give to beginners is to dca (*dollar cost average*) when building up a stack.to those who don't know, this means putting a fixed amount of fiat into coins at regular intervals to avoid buying the top, instead spreading out your investments over time to get a lower *average cost* (per coin). with a volatile asset like crypto, this makes a lot of sense and has been proven to get better results long term.when it comes to taking profits, we tell them to dca out. but dca is not the correct term for what we're trying to do.what we want to do when selling off crypto could be called *coin price averaging*, because we aim to sell a fixed amount of *coins* at regular points in time, getting a better average price.if you literally dca out, selling off say $100 at a time, you will get less for your money. at a lower price per coin, selling $100 worth means selling *more coins per dollar.* it's a great way to play yourself.obviously *cpa* is already taken, but is there a proper term to describe this method?

thats what happened in solona, it went  x4 quite fast, maybe more  almost in 4-6months.but in cardano aswell xrp this increase is quite few and slow compared to some other coins. why is that? it wents pump and dump, but after some pump, if you watch closely, it always moves in same prices. /ENDPOST/ there is a lessening of available buyees, you would think.  china outlawed it.  india considering strong regulations, other 3rd world countries don't know what to do, so waver and flounder.no problem.  we love it.  also the eu, russia, canada, australia.  is this a first world thing?

anyone else?to start always store your seed and pkeys (are within the wallet/seed grants access) store these phrases or alphanumeric codes on paper multiples of them make two or three copies you are responsible to keep your funds safe. so dont put on a device like in word, notes or other programs. if you want to print it you can but know that if you have a keylogging program (malware) on your pc or other device and its looking for seeds or pkeys they they will be found by someone. also when using internet i advise everyone to use a vpn more so if you are using crypto or any programs like exchanges even to look at crypto or even to earn tips make sure you use a vpn.need a free vpn? windscribe has 2gb a month no verification and 10gb for free for a verified email account.so make sure you have good security run it often and also use iphone if your using a smart phone. also. dont store the seed or pkeys or even passwords to the accounts or apps on any digital  file software like word or notes. write them all down when you get them. put it in a diary or a writing book or other notes. you will get a new seed every time you make a new wallet which will have all new pkeys for each chain thats  held in the new wallet. you need seed or pkey when you transact funds from your eg, trust wallet eth address being an address that is stored on the ethereum erc20 chain with a private key to the chain or the seed to the wallet required to move the funds stored there.i had more here that i accidentally deleted it and cant be un-done it glitched out and post writing is lagging hard. will write it up in  another writing app and put here. need to wash dogs and have dinner first. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ dear crypto friends,lets help each others to understand how much time we have to act.do you think it could be functional to move massively to decentralized platforms to be safe?if we shoot off their radars, we have won their control.we take all money out of centralized exchange platforms.and if we think tomorrow that we will have the possibility to trade again we are wrong, because we will not be able to do anything anymore.there is nothing new in this, but i put some useful infos together for everyone whom could agree with this thought.action:keep your cryptocurrencies on a private wallet and trade on decentralized platforms.not your keys not your coins (elon musk even said that).these are the platforms that can guarantee us the possibility of getting out of this nightmare.p2p platforms: (to buy or sell crypto-from fiat and vice versa)&amp;#x200b;1. localcryptos 	(no kyc required)2. localcoinswap 	(no kyc required)useful tips for use:&amp;#x200b;1.

(i.e. do i lose anything to impermanent loss?)* "all-in" value: how much would my original investment be worth if i had invested everything into the crypto instead of splitting it into 50% stablecoin / 50% crypto?

/ENDPOST/ so if some one needed a wallet for a little bit of crypto like maybe a grand or two and occasionally transfers from mining on 2 gpus what's better than coinbase. coinbase eats me up in fees when selling and transferring to my bank in the event i need it. i sold 100$ worth of one particular crypto, ended up with 94$ then transfered to bank and after that fee i ended up with around 89$ so this was a 10% cut.i'm not a rich crypto miner. i don't buy crypto as often as i wish i could afford but i'd love to be able to buy and sell without the fear of massive fees and maybe try to do some buying the dip action and selling at the peaks on smaller priced coins like shiba.i want to try crypto.  com but it seems worse than coinbase because they hold the 35$ in there unless i sign up for the credit card lol. and the fees look rough for transferring money.so tldr comparing fees, ease of use, time to transfer to and from bank [usd] and coin options what's the best ? is there one i should look into i may not know about ? i'm lookin to put a few bucks in and i really want one wallet that does it all /ENDPOST/ so majority of people here firmly believe the bull run is not over, not until q1 of 2022 (at the minimum). also, the majority of people hodl, and dca in during all times.and "suddenly", there's whale shennanings due to (most likely) options expiring, like there's every single month for the past half a year, prices come down a bit, and people go into the "this is the end of the world" shouting match with themselves, and start panic selling.i mean, i just don't get it. i don't blindly hodl, i'm not that strong. but most people here does hodl. most still think the bull run is not done. especially for people that dca, this is like a crypto yard sale, everything is on discount. most people know the prices will bounce back in a day, or a week, or a month. yet... some people panic sell.can someone please enlighten me? /ENDPOST/ ape here. i got into crypto at the very beginning of 2021. ended up investing way more than i was planning to. i just ran some numbers and learned i am currently +40% on the year. i realize that is not bad, but honest question, should it be better? i rode through the summer dip and in better shape now, but do you think 40% is below average for the year? my portfolio is a mix of btc,eth and a half dozen shitcoins. i'm still looking at some decent gains on shib from september (cb listing) but no other big winners to report. am i bad at this? not complaining, just curious. thanks. /ENDPOST/ it has been funny watching the sentiment change over time on cro since i first got in and started using my jade green card about 9 months ago. i just wanted to make a post to remind people why it is catching on and growing and is actually a great crypto project from a purist perspective, and no, the reason isn't matt damon.earlier this year cdc announced the launch of cronos, their decentralised mainnet platform. overnight they burnt 70 billion cro, with a further 10 billion burnt once they were released from a smart contract (80% of total supply)!!! this enabled cronos to be launched through a fully decentralised proof of stake consensus, i.e. the network is governed by decentralised staking nodes. it cannot be shut down, it cannot be overriden, it cannot be controlled.so when they launched defi, it was real decentralised financewhen they launched nfts they were real decentralised nftswhen they give you 10% staking rewards for the card, or approx 12-14% defi rewards, it isn't just being paid out of some bottomless wallet causing inflationary devaluation of the token, it has a genuine upward impact on the market price of the token.so look, the cards are great (i love mine), the marketing is great, the customer service is great, i'm partial to a bit of matt damon, but please let's remember that unlike many other platforms (not going to name and shame and start arguments but dyor) cro is the real deal of exactly what crypto was always supposed to be. not to be confused with the exchange, which is centralised, the token is decentralised, and that really matters. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ hard to explain in the title, but i want to set crypto alerts to know when the market is low. the problem is that all of the crypto websites/apps i find have alerts only when the price hits x. so if is at 57k, i can set it at 55k, for example. this is not what i want.first of all, i want a % not a specific value. some offer it and some don't, but of course, i could calculate the % manually, but what i want specifically is when the market drops by % against a benchmark of a previous price (last week, last month, etc). this allows me to know when the market is low (and i can define what i consider low) forever.otherwise, if i am stuck with the alerts that i am finding, i need to constantly reset the alerts depending on how the pricing develops over time. in the way i wanted, you only have to do this once.has anyone found what i am looking for? /ENDPOST/ a common meme is saying "buy high, sell low", which implies that both buying high and selling low are bad. even though this is a joke it can discourage beginners from getting into cryptocurrencies. only the combination of buying high and selling low is a problem. since the creation of bitcoin the trend of cryptocurrencies as a whole has been upwards. even if you happen to buy perfectly at the ath (which is unlikely), in the long run you will still make profits. just make sure to hold and don't get cold feet when it drops for a while.i dont want people to stop using the phrase "buy high, sell low", but rather encourage people, especially beginners, to get into crypto. you are still early and trying to time the market by waiting for a dip can make you miss out on significant gains.this doesn't apply to memecoins, as most are heavily inflationary and won't survive in the long term. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ hey, guys. please i am doing some research on the various crypto launchpads out there and how they work, and i need your input.&amp;#x200b;* what crypto launchpads have you used or been using?* what are their requirements and everything a first-timer needs to know about them?* what are the practical, step by step guides to participating in new token sales on the launchpad?&amp;#x200b;what's been your experience on this platform and do you think it's worth it for especially small investors or not?&amp;#x200b;i will be tipping the best and most helpful comments with some moons.&amp;#x200b;thanks for your responses. /ENDPOST/ dear all,i am currently discovering and actually using defi (really happy about it). i hodl'd throughout the beginning of the year, mainly btc and eth.but i am now lending out stablecoins (usdt, usdc, and would love to lend out dai but need to figure out makerdao for that), some eth tokens on aave (matic network). of course, i see wbtc on balancer and yearn with appealing apy/aprs and then i wonder: "what are the pros and cons of wrapping my btc and lending that out?" and after that the question: "how would i wrap it best and easiest?"these are the questions i have and i am hoping reddit brings users with experience in this matter instead of articles to help me out here.kind regards,herb /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ ive been peering though the crypto curtians for a few years now, going along for the ride mostly blind folded since 2017.  i have a small bag (dont know if i should say how much because of the internet baddies) of a few project i like from the little research i have done and just started dca weekly for btc and eth ($40aud each  week)i'm keen to learn the ins and outs of cypto as of recently quiting the unproductive scrolling of facebook and instagram and am looking for some good sources to learn from.are there courses anyone would recommend? are they a waste of money?how did you learn the world of crypto?videos would be ideal as i'm a visual learner but not a crucial.what advice has stuck with you the most?cheers /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ i recently saw a reddit livestream where the person was asking for help investing in crypto.  the very first thing they said was that they wanted to invest in shiba because they heard it would would be smart to buy a million shiba.  then if it ever went to a dollar they would be a millionaire.it was difficult explaining why a dollar would never happen. but i think explaining that it would have to have a market cap bigger than bitcoin helped. (after loosely explaining market cap)but it really made me realize how naive we all are when we start out here.  but i say, if thats what draws them in, fine!  we all learn very quickly robinhood is shit and shitcoins are even shittier.and in the end we start to understand the tech and how this is shaping the world to come.though we still dont mind the profits of course :)tl;dr - come for the profits, stay for the tech /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ ok so one of my earlier posts today got deleted for being low effort so im going to step this up a notch by bringing a random shitcoin into the limelight for discussion. this is high-effort, by my own low standards, so if it too gets deleted i will know this is a personal attack.when i first heard about verge (xvg), i knew it as dogecoin dark, and always liked the notion of privacy within the crypto space, which was the main reason i invested. monero (xmr) was also of huge interest, but naturally i focused my attention on this low market cap shitcoin because it was going to moon, obviously.shortly after buying a bunch, i then purchased a mining rig to start mining verge, as i had the opportunity to have the rig in a location where electricity costs were about half the local averages, due to the city having its own community-owned power company. this made it feasible to run 24/7 and was producing a decent amount at the time, although i dont recall the exact yield, the price of verge was around $0.02 at the time, much like where it currently is today.i watched xvg moon to around $0.28 and held onto those bags for dear life, never selling. all this to say, while i am still a believer that verge has some announcements coming that will give it some positive attention to push the price back up, i still wish i would have sold it all and put all that money into eth and btc back in the day, along with ada when it was priced around a penny. i knew better, but thought i could beat the market, thought i had found a hidden gem among crypto tokens.the only reason it still interests me is, aside from the size of my bags, the privacy aspect, which i feel there is still much room for competition within the cryptosphere. anyone else got xvg bags? /ENDPOST/ i want to share a small datat tracking of my excel, so we can put things into perspective with a zoom

friends,honestly i can't find a better place to ask for some genuine answers regarding this subject. i know most of you probably use hot wallets for long term deposits. i was researching on the internet and found about alot of those, like trust wallet, metamask, maiar, blockchain, exodus etc. maybe most of you will shill your current wallet, but what i am trying to look into is to what is most secure of them all.i will try and pick up the most voted wallet here. if you recommend, please write down pro's n con's of each wallet. i would personally avoid web browser extension wallets. it is really difficult to find a good one in this sea of apps.so to sum it up? which hot wallet in your opinion is worth keeping your funds safe (dont recommend hardware wallets) and what are the pros and cons of each?thank you for your answers! /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ i was hoping to take this opportunity to bet on new altcoins since the market's a bit wild right now. it's easier buying and hodling the hits. standard is btc/eth, and other popular altcoins like algo, ada, ltc and the like. but when i look at new altcoins, i can't for the life of me identify where to start lmaoi read that [panther](https://blockworks.co/panther-protocol-closes-22m-public-sale-in-under-90-minutes/) focuses on privacy/security, which is a good thing to me. i'm also checking out [harmony](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harmony/) and [pancake](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/) and even [aave](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/). i want to learn more about new altcoins tho because i know we might be overlooking some of them. not sure what they're doing wrong that's not giving them more attention though? how do you spot altcoins with potential?to those who were with us since the old days, what things should new altcoins do to get them more attention compared to big name altcoins? i want to know how to spot rising altcoins too lol /ENDPOST/ ahoy! yesterday i found out my boss invests in cryptocurrencies. normally i don't talk about any kind of financials, especially cryptocurrencies, but it was kind of nice to be able to talk to someone about the market and different projects.i don't ever hear people in public talking about crypto, but i also overheard some customers chatting about it as well earlier in the day. i can't help but feel that mass adoption is closer than we think.how do y'all feel about speaking publicly about crypto? do you keep it secret, for privacy, safety, etc.or do you try to convert the uninitiated? /ENDPOST/ hi, hope all are well!here is a crazy (and quite funny) story that just happened with me.so i decided to finally dive in on pancake swap and buy some coin, ore in this case. i've used trader joe before so pretty much the same deal, buy from fiat on cex and transfer in.so i transfer some usdt from coinbase pro to metamask (1st fee) and of course it goes to the ethereum main network.so i go to swap from ethereum network to bsc, and i need ethereum to pay for the cost to do the swap. \*sigh\* i wish they'd just deduct it from whatever i'm sending.so, i send ethereum from my mining wallet to my metamask (2nd fee), and now i'm ready to swap networks.i proceed with the swap and it costs, apparently $21(3rd fee) to "access" the transaction / funds, and then another $40 (4th fee) to actually make the transaction?! alright, fine. i should have my usdt and be ready to buy the coin i want.i go to buy the coin i want, and i need bnb to complete the transaction. i buy bnb from my preferred cex, paying a commission fee (5th) on the purchase, and another fee to transfer it again to my metamask wallet (6th fee)finally, i am able to pay the bnb fee (7th fee) to successfully buy the coin i want.it took a total of 7 fees to add new fiat and buy a coin. i had to pay to send fiat, then to send ethereum, then to conduct the network bridge, then to buy and add bnb, to finally buy the coin i want. as read, it was probably about 80$ in fees. kinda ridiculous. i mean it's fair, i like that miners make it, so i'm feeding our own ecosytem, but still pretty crazy.any thoughts? suggestions or alternatives? thanks in advance fellow traders! /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ the world of streetwear, fashion, and sneakers were met with a shocking news of louis vuitton's virgil abloh. virgil worked with nike; spear headed his own brand- off-white; and as recently reported, worked as the lvmh designer.on a [tweet](https://twitter.com/fehrsam/status/1465173368999583752?s=20) by fred ehrsam, he shared the drafted vision of virgil known as "skyscraper." briefly in 25 pages, virgil shared his vision of web 3.0, nft, and dao. you can find the document there, linked at the tweet.this was the line explaining "skyscraper"&gt;"what i have running in my head is to start a real-life, digital museum."the project was supposed to have 5 core 'path of development.' this is from building a corporate structure, designing original nfts, partnerships, cultivation of artists, and "skyscraper" to be both a digital space with a physical feel.in his vision, he shared how in the past, digital is its own entity, but now, the physical world is inevitably tied to the digital world.brands such as lvmh is no stranger to nft. they've been investing in several entities such as arianee previously, and now exploring to launch nfts via aura luxury blockchain. this will enable buyers to have access to the product history and proof of authenticity of their purchased luxury goods  from sourcing to sales, all the way to second-hand markets- via nft.&amp;#x200b;i got some sense of respect to the works done by virgil abloh, and it's bitter sweet seeing "skyscrapper" may launch without the man, himself. one thing for sure, it will be soon before we see commercial brands opting in the metaverse. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [this highlights](https://i.imgur.com/67fywas.png) how emotion can lead to significant losses. the word hodl is often used as a meme but holding is definitely the best bet for most of the people. i know it looks scary when every coin is dropping by 10% or more, especially if you are a new investor. but when in doubt, zoom out.10% or even 20% is nothing compared to the gains in the long run, especially with huge projects like the current crypto.com

chance that you are missing an opportunity is basically zero. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ gi think plenty of the cex tokens (**bnb, kcs, cro, etc**) have seen a huge increase in gain and there are plenty more gains to be seen in the coming years. some of the reasons for their success is that their tokens produce:1. discounted transaction fees.2. staking rewards3. continued increase in value intrinsically tied to the success of the exchange.the exchanges themselves also allow **a ton** of conveniences:1. pseudo-bridging chains together to allow users to use different layers, sidechains, or different chains altogether.2. hold all their tokens and fiat.3. execute trades efficiently and rapidly4. level of security and/or some insurance against theft.&amp;#x200b;so now i wonder: because the spirit of cryptocurrency is decentralization and trustless transactions, then these exchanges aren't exactly the embodiment. might there be an exchange with the underlying technology to offer such benefits without the centralization we see with these exchanges?it is interesting to see that the current big cexes don't plan on innovating into something along these lines. i have only heard whisper or rumours that there are plans for such an exchange built with certain other cryptos (**sol, lrc, algo)**.in my mind in the next few years, we will see a continued growth with almost all of the cex tokens. and then, in the further future there could be a new dex entering into the fray that will take a foothold and potentially the whole market. **the question is now: can we find it before it explodes?** /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ &amp;#x200b;[we know metaverse tokens are having a good rally for now, this is another one which we can keep for a watch axs\/usdt

(mostly metaverse) that haven't quite hit the mainstream yet. i've been using ftx us and [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) because i live in the united states and there's not much else to use (kucoin, binance aren't available in the us) but these exchanges don't add coins until its too late.  are you guys using vpns or is there another exchange i am missing? /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ i see they are two separate apps, but they have a connection. im trying them both and they have their own coins (bat &amp; pre). which one is better in your opinion? i want you to stay focused on actual security of the blockchain they run on, ad blocking and privacy. plus, if i need to do something in particular to store my rewards from using them, like downloading other apps or (?)i just dont want to use chrome anymore, i hate the fact that it always changes something in privacy whenever they want, and you have to accept in very subtle formats. i like the security these new platforms promise, and i would like to hear pros and cons of using them instead of classics firefox, google, bing etci think that this kind of project could be one of the very first crypto related revolutions that could involve general public, like google was for internet 2.0. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ does anyone have a post explaining all about defi and something about

having to pay back. you invite 100 people with your link and your rolling in metaphorical money for a year until you have real money(mine is 3555gbky). this is your sales pitch just send it to someone else. the  rewards for getting other people to join are ridiculous and these coins are just tokens with whatever value we decide to assign to them.note:not sponsored or anything i just think this will become the next thing. i have gotten $21 so far and i can withdraw in a year. i collect about $1.20 a day now before it was $0.73. the more people there are the more it goes up.another note:im also

of a defi currency, but imagine for a minute that something like btc was the currency of the world in mar 2020.finally, on dec 31, 2019, the world realized the evils of centralized fiat currency, and every nation in the world announced they were shutting down their currencies, and btc would be the only recognized legal tender, worldwide.we will set aside the issue with everyone having only this fiat currency as their store of wealth, and that there would be no way to convert fiat to crypto, because no one is going to exchange something that has no worth for something of value, so just ignore that for now.you did it!!!  you took down the centralized money system!  everybody gets a lambo!  you get a lambo, and you get a lambo and you get a lambo!  (invoke oprah in your head as you read).now, i'm sure everything is running smoothly, cuz without this fiat currency, everyone knows what 1 btc is worth, right, because it's not like the value of btc has been tied to how much fiat it can be sold for, for it's entire existence, right?but, wait...oh no.  a pandemic hits.  quarantine has been ordered in most countries, worldwide, and many people lose their jobs.  most people in the industrialized world live paycheck to paycheck, and have little savings.currency is no longer centralized by the nations, or regions (in the case of the euro and the eu), so these governments are unable to send money to their citizens, because they no longer create the money, which is now fixed in the total supply available, anyway.what happens?my belief is that in the case, more people die of poverty related causes, including suicide, than die from the disease of the pandemic.discuss... /ENDPOST/ i'm moving to germany in march, kln to be more specific.i live in argentina and we have quite an economic situation here which is pretty difficult to explain now. we do not make a bill of practically anything, to evoid crazy huge taxes and blablabla, we cannot (legally) buy more than 200 dollars a month in the banks, so we go to la cueva (the cave) which is a place where you can buy or sell any fiat currency (euros, dollars, real, etc) you want for the double prize that the bank does. so, i'm a common user of one "cueva" which allows you tu buy usdt for a 3% commission.my question is, international laws allow me to travel only with 10.000 dollars to europe. i'm planning to open an account on gls bank and or in revolute; let's say i've got 20.000 euros in binance and i want to withdraw them to my bank account. is it easy to do? do i have to justify were they came from? or something like that? any advices to add to my question? thank you guys! /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ since 2018 i've been working on the creation of a blockchain *protocol for* ***open source medical research without intellectual property*** *aka the* **etica protocol**.

debating about which coin is the next big one. i mean every day we shill the coin we want to see succeed and make our bags grow.currently there is a lot speculation on how big cro will be and if they will become the next biggest thing in crypto.i want to look at a few different things, throw out some ideas, and put my 2 cents on what i am banking on for investment / financial growth.first, time shows us the ups and down of crypto.jan of 2021 bnb was $40. it is used to pay for trades on its own exchange. if people were honest did they expect (not hope) that bnb would be sitting at $600 today?  were they expecting a 15x return? in may when it topped out at $690 did they sell off as the market dipped? happy to get whatever they could as the price went down? how long before people started being bullish on it again as it sat in that $300ish area for a while?seeing the current rise again what would most project it to rise to? not hope but seeing the market, the new players in the crypto market and the addition of cro.why mention cro now? we can talk again about the card they offer, the money back options, free spotify/netflix/etc as well as staking options.but what is it that they offer?apples to apples bnb and cro both provide a platform to trade crypto.crypto.com would be considered by many to be nothing special when compared to bnb until recently when they have exploded on the marketing scene.  now the boards cannot go without constantly singing the praises of their marketing, being accessible to the average person, all the card benefits and more.this leads me to my second thought.what are we expecting and hoping for from cro and its possible market price?imagine 1 year from now.  if it experienced the same growth as bnb the price would be $11.25. people will say but why not $200/$400/$600?obviously there is a difference in the circulating supply.  167mil vs 25bil is no small difference. trying to hit $200 per coin on a supply that large does seem impossible in a year.so lets play a fantasy game.  lets ignore all the marketing hype. lets ignore the hopium  lets just say both see a 5x gainso lets say you have $10,000 to invest.bnb $10,000 @ $600 a coin is 16.6 coins. when the price 5x you now have $49,800 yielding a profit of $39,800.cro $10,000 @ .75 a coin is 13,333.3 coins. a 5x increase is $50,000.  thus again a $40,000 profit.so neither coin created a magical gain. both were equal in gains.the next questions are: is $3000 per coin likely for bnb? is $3.75 likely for cro?bnb is still below its all time high. cro many would say has yet to really leave the gate in potential.so why is there so much hope for one and hate for the other?i will say that a large majority of my bags have shifted to cro because after dyor i feel one has a higher chance of success in the long term.cro i believe is the first crypto to really fire off the publicity cannons in an attempt to market itself to people of every financial spectrum.  their pr team needs a bonus for the buzz they have created, securing the crypto.com page, going all in on marketing sports and more.it took me seeing a stupid add for coinbase over 50xs a while back before i finally said why not.  now people watching basketball, f1 and more will see and hear that name and eventually many will say the same thing.so as next year is about to start, and many of our hopes of finding a coin to invest and diamond hold while it blasts off is on our mind i have found myself going all in on cro.im ruby card staked, getting that free return for holding, saving $ on netflix &amp; spotify, and enjoying the cash back  all while investing in a company and coin i feel will lead crypto to the next level.^^ends self shill^^im looking forward to hearing your thoughts on my thoughts. /ENDPOST/ i have recently jumped down the lex friedman podcast rabbit hole, and i was listening to his talk with sergey nazarov from may 1st (who i believe is associated with chainlink?).the one question i really had a hard time wrapping my head around was, if a trusted entity (i.e. the blockchain) references an trust-less entity (i.e. whatever database the oracle network references), does this not corrupt or dirty the original trusted entity?maybe the answer is to just go read a white paper about this somewhere, but i wanted to know what methods the oracle networks are implementing in order to bring trust to the system. /ENDPOST/ article

zhao, binance's founder gave an interview to 'les echos' a french economy newspaper, here are the key points:&amp;#x200b;* for him, crypto have changed:"binance has seen their customer base jump from 20 millions to 85 millions this year. since 2013 cryptos have gone forward thanks to more uses and applications (ico, nft gamefi sports token) on usages that can't be done in the traditional finance sector."&amp;#x200b;* advantages of being a big exchange:there are clearly advantages to operate a large platform. binance's worldwide leadership (70% of the market in front coinbase's 8%) allows us to invest hundreds of millions to get better infrastructures (securitiy efficiency  and customer services). investing on a big platform is less risky and cheaper for an investor.&amp;#x200b;*  about an european hq;we started as a decentralized organization but we need to realize it is not seen on a keen eye by regulators. our industry needs to be regulated and we are starting to create local, regional and worldwide headquarters.our priorities are to get authorized to create cryptos markets as there are not yet authorizations for these kind of activities, which means an authorization from each country. as soon as possible, france would be a natural choice for a regional or worldwide headquarters. we first need to get the psan authorization.* small points:france regulator seems to have

actually pretty simple. recently, i participated in a scavenger hunt hosted by ftx usa in which they gave everyone who was in the top 100 $50 in crypto. i completed the hunt several times with different accounts each. ftx usa plans to distribute the money via a person signing up for an ftx account with one of the winning emails and then distributing that money into their account. as you can only make one account per person i'm trying to sell the remaining emails here for below their actual value. i have 14 accounts available that i will be selling. i've attached some proof that i did in fact win the scavenger hunt below. payment wise i'm hoping to send you an email and you simply venmo/zelle me the money. i'm open to negotiating the price so please pm about about it if you're interested.if anyone is interested please pm me and i'll send you a message about payment details. please also pm me about any concerns you may have. thank you.https://preview.redd.it/ru77rib94h281.jpg?width=2550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66df30dacab5e0ba382a6dfce0f7abd2bd8c8349 /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ if i'm honest, lately i've been thinking that crypto really started to get mainstream and with popularity i was pretty sure that there isn't a living being that doesn't know about the success of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.yesterday, i was talking with a colleague of mine who is a chocolatier (dude makes good chocolate stuff) and is starting to offer his products online. he really makes some good shit, i get to try it sometimes and it's really tasty. anyway..i asked him if he is planning to have crypto payments on his website. he looked me straight in the eye and told me, quoting **"only weed sellers have crypto payments on websites mate" .**i didn't push him further because it didn't feel worth it. but it's really mind-boggling how people still think that btc and eth are used for such activities. let alone smaller cryptos. i was about to mention xlm and algo to him as payment options but he would dismiss it anyway. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ regardless of the current state of the cryptocurrency market (and therefore bitcoin) the same cycles always seem to repeat. we are in this because of our ideologies, interests and/or simply money. but when things go sideways or up, emotions always get raw. here is my personal take on especially the downside phases of bitcoin regarding historical prices, focusing on the 2018 bear market bottom and the late 2019 bottom. with the given context that many bottoms and peaks are yet to come.2018  bitcoin tumbles to $3,100one thing is clear. people can have different interpretations of what a bottom is. and what could be a universally accepted bottom is often not. and when we reached the absolute bottom in hindsight, people still feared a deeper plunge. and with people i dont mean only the laymans people like we are, but also the professional investors.the thing is, that bitcoin and all the other cryptocurrencies are relatively young and new tech/economical applications. when a subject gets hit in a growing state, it is bound to hit like a truck. the bitcoin tumbling down from $11,000 to about $5,800 was not even the end of it. when it plunged down further with about 45% to $3,100, the general sentiment was at best gloomy. the tech is worthless, fiat money forever and i told you so, all quotes we remember being said on media and even by our own family and friends.2019  bitcoin falls to $6,500in 2019 the bear market ended and something incredible happened. bitcoin went from $4k to $14k in just a couple of months. we all thought we were entering a hyper bull run, facebook announced its then called libra and we were shooting straight for the moon. but as a rollercoaster, that seemed like a peak you had to get down of. we went all the way down to $7k. a halving you might say. in value, that is. with some other news rumbling about big parties mentioning blockchain, the bitcoin value began to soar again, and so did our emotions. is bitcoin here to stay?, company x said something positive about bitcoin, bullish!, and friends already making dinner appointments at restaurants for us to financially cover.nowthe current value of bitcoin (and any other cryptocurrency) right now doesnt matter in the context of this thread. it might be up or down compared to when i started writing this. what i do know is that there are many bottoms and peaks yet to come. the general crowd naturally doubts new tech / applications and we are a part of the latter. of course we too have our doubts from time to time. but remember the apples and facebooks, starting in their garage with no real future perspective at that time. we are in for a wild ride.**one day we will read this quote as said by ethereum founder vitalik buterin in history books**"whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly."remember, we are at the beginning of this movement. there will be doubts and certainly some growing pains. but that is all part of the journey. in a few years, people will be asking: where were you when bitcoin / other crypto really took off?. /ENDPOST/ hi all,i thought of creating a multi vendor marketplace platform which accepts cryptocurrency as a method of payment.in this marketplace, there will be two types of vendors.**1. vendors who accept cryptocurrency as payments.**here, when a customer purchases a product, the customer pays in a cryptocurrency which is accepted my vendor. the transaction is done between the customer and vendor. this way, there will be no middle man intervening the transaction.**2. vendors who accept fiat currency as payments.**here, when a customer purchases a product, the customer pays in cryptocurrency which is accepted by the platform. once the periodic withdrawal date is reached, the cryptocurrency sales will be converted into fiat currency sale minus the commission to pay the vendor.note that i will be acting as third party mediator in this scenario. fiat currency vendor withdrawals will be approved manually by me.the reason for introducing this second type of vendors is to attract more vendors. such as seller who already sell products on amazon or ebay. these sellers will have comparatively lower marketplace commissions rates compared to ebay and amazon's \~10% as a result these sellers will help to create a network effect which platforms like openbazzar lack.let me know your thoughts about this idea. initially i thought of using wordpress to create this marketplace website and integrate a thirst party crypto payment processor. then i later realized that this approach will make the system centralized. i m still new to crypto, so i don't have much knowledge in creating dapps.in the off chance where this idea is really good, i would invite you to team up with me so that we can make this vision a success.thank you /ENDPOST/ you get off work on friday and look forward to the weekend all week. only to start feeling like your already short weekend is over starting sunday morning, hell for those of us that dislike work alot, it may kick in saturday night while going to bed. that dear dread people is the sunday scaries. a plague that affects 97.3% of all full time workers. it's also proven that 98% of people who suffer from the sunday scaries live shorter lives by almost 20 years. a cure for this dreadful disease you may ask? everyone's crypto mooning and being able to retire early. never having a full time job to be scared about going to thus decreasing stress levels thus saving lives.moral of the story is crypto can save a life. do yourself a favor and get more skin in the game.this is not financial advice but could be health advice..... /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/

and this pump might of made some think we gotten out of that. but i wanted to warn people that we still are well within the channel. we really need to be above $59k and staying above that.but what worries me is on the next charthttps://preview.redd.it/jrior9v3tg281.png?width=1422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb9c212e4e8eac680c2d89908b20177cdd63cd01https://preview.redd.it/47g7b8wftg281.png?width=1423&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f97cf4f407a5046bdb7adc7dd1f79b588cd599fsorry for the bright picture but the volume is hard to see otherwise. anyways, we are seeing a downward trend when it comes to volume.# this is why we are seeing massive drops and a hard time it going upbasically, the whale are pumping it or maybe a ton of us normal people are pumping it. but it takes almost no large amount to lower the price. there isn't as many involved in crypto trading like there once was.# good news:we been almost at the same level when it comes to volume for 4 months now (august). this means we should start to see the dip massively slow down. also while we are in new areas. we have seen in the past like oct of last year when volume leveled like it is now. we see a massive increase in price (from $10k to $60k).note: i'm not saying lets expect anything like a 6x ($360k). i'm saying we are consolidating where it becomes extremely hard to lower the price and we are seeing in the past where this happens before jumps.&amp;#x200b;# a few side things to note:the first and biggest is outside factors. one of the biggest things that helped us toward the start of this year was things like the stimulus checks. like it or not, we most likely will get another round of this depending on this new virus. reports have confirm it is in europe, there is reports saying the likely has traveled to canada from europe and through that usa. here in the usa we are already seeing military being deploy to hospitals in areas like colorado, a massive uptick in cases, a spike in deaths, and so on. like nothing is official about it being here but all signs are showing it is already here.now what this means is likely another round of lock downs in most areas, many workers will be out of the job because the type of job they had (at least until lock downs are over), more people with money problems, and so on. an chances are the best way the gov can save people from going into massive debt, a massive amount going bankrupt, and so on is by yet another round of checks to everyone like the last few times. like the other possibilities is no checks which there is some likely to that, or maybe no lock downs which i seriously doubt will be a thing.point being, if we see another round of checks then we might see another massive pump in the market. so keep an eye on that. but if they don't come, lockdowns do end up happening, and other problems happen. we could see people pull money out of crypto to help feed their families.but note i think this is something to look for over the next 6 months on how things play out. /ENDPOST/ just sharing an experience i had last night. i tried to send stellar lumens from my australian exchange coinspot to my other cex: gate.io (so i can exchange  xlm to usdt and then buy the coin i want from gate.io).i waited about 5 minutes and it didn't arrive. then a bit longer. i had no idea what happened (done this transaction many times so code's were correct etc.).at first i thought the problem was on gate's side seeing the transaction id (txid) was approved on coinspot's side. i did a blockchain explorer on the stellar coins and it couldn't detect it.so what i learned, if the txid doesn't appear on blockchain explorer, the problem is with the original source, so, in my case - coinspot. i contacted them and sure enough, the problem was on their side and i got the coins back to coinspot.anyway, sorry if this a bit boring. still learning my way around and i hope this helps someone. /ENDPOST/ this saves me potential thousands of dollar loss. today, i moved from binance to [c](https://crypto.com)dc exchange. binance is no longer available to us live in ontario, canada after december this year. during the process, i see [c](https://crypti.com)dc does support busd. i was thinking of sending the whole 5k busd to [c](https://crypto.com)dc then remember a post here sometime ago, mentions about sending test amount first. i'm glad i did because after sending out 10 busd on bep20, i have not received it on cdc side, even though the transaction is success on bscscan.always send test amount even it costs you twice as much to send a transaction. /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ [removed] /ENDPOST/ most of us know that when bitcoin moves, other cryptos move, sometimes identically.i see many comments and posts each time it happens in an obvious way (usually accompanying a fast swing by btc) calling it out and either asking why it occurs or attributing it to some organized manipulation. even some well-intentioned commenters explain how there is increased confidence in the markets during a bitcoin surge and so investors jump in alts at the same time. the same can be said about a sudden fall, where bitcoin loses value suddenly and all the alts follow suite.when i first started in crypto, ill admit it confused me too. but now it makes sense and hopefully it will to you too.alts are markets inside markets. bitcoin is nested in the fiat market and alts are nested in the bitcoin market.in order to understand why cryptos rise and fall with bitcoin, you need to stop thinking of alts directly in fiat value, thats too many steps. this isnt like stocks where everything is traded against the usd. this is crypto, where everything is traded against other crypto and the reserve currency is bitcoin. as the largest share of trading pairs, btc is the market stabilizer in the same sort of way that the usd is the reserve currency in the global market. yes we have stable coins, but they dont dominate the market like the bitcoin pairs.when we compare the value of two cryptos we can forget that we are actually looking at their value in yet a third currency. you may be only looking at two coins but you are including a third trading pair of fiat.  instead, keep it simple and consider only two assets, one trading pair, at a time. during a shared price movement, look at the value of your coin and its movements in its value in bitcoin and youll see an accurate market value of your coin within crypto. the magic of the price of all coins moving in harmony falls away. if there is a significant change against btc, you at least have a proper baseline for seeing true movement of your coins divergence from the baseline within crypto. now you can introduce the fiat market into consideration if you want. it is the tertiary market in this trio.lets make a quick oversimplified example to drive the point home:if i were to buy shares in the american company apple, which is valued in usd, and then the usd somehow suddenly rose 3% in value, would i be surprised that both the usd and the apple stock i own both increased 3% when i lookup the value in euros? of course not. apple is still worth the exact same usd as before. now since the euro is smaller you may say the euro fell 3% instead. its all relative but the point is the dollar moved and apple stock did not, unless you care about apples value in terms of a third asset. in crypto, fiat is the third asset.tldr: matryoshka dolls &amp; relativity

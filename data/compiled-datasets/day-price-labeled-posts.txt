UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// is dogecoin worth buying? like say this is 2011, operation iraq freedom (gulf war pt2) what would be the effect on bitcoin? i may get a rather large sum in btc soon and was wondering how to clean them.so is there a reputable place that does it without running away with it? as in the past currencies has been backed by sillver(gbp), usd(gold) or petroleum is it possible that some nations hold bitcoin as a national reserve and issue currency.as btc is rare so maybe very small percentage might be backed . total btc reserve divided by btc holding. hey r/bitcoin !i am new to bitcoin and don't really understand all this stuff. basically there is this app i want to buy, but it costs around 15$ in bitcoin. i was wondering how i could get started bitcoin mining. i have a mid range gaming gpu and electricity is free. also, how long do you think it will take to mine 15$ of bitcoin? thank you! [removed] [removed] please forgive me for not knowing terminology as im not very tech savvy but i just received a block of text that i need to sign with my own private key which i have done but when i go to broadcast this signed text it doesnt let me, would anyone kindly be able to help me out? i ordered a ledger nano s today to move my btc that ive been holding for several years in my electrum wallet along with several shit coins that i have in other hot wallets. im doing this for two reasons. 1) more secure... 2) to put them all in one device. i hope i dont regret it. for a while now, before investing in crypto, i read and watched a bit about crypto. i get most of it but what i dont get is the price, why does it sink or climb. i mean what has to happen for a currency to climb like 20-50% or sink 10%. does it depend on how many people buy and sell or are there other things that has to happen. hey guys,im sick of sending money to my ex and my daughter that live in syria and they cant receive money in us dollars. central bank playing dirty games there and pay my ex shitty money.i told her to get a bitcoin wallet but its not popular there yet. i checked localbitcoin and its far and dangerous to drive.would really be happy if you could suggest something.again im in the states and shes in syria.not to mention the hassle every time isend her money when westernunion start asking stupid questions and sometimes hold the money just bc they found out i was born in syria.they ask how am i related to her. why am i sending her money. when was the last time i was there. am i planning on going there again. after all that. they sometimes say sorry we cant help. and when they do, syrian banks control prices.thanks. [removed] i just received a letter in the mail from the irs stating that they are aware that i have crypto, and did not claim it yet. i'm sure others have received the same letter. so, if you want to post information here, you can. i thought that it would be better if we can choose the route in which to proceed all in one place. i am not suggesting that you do anything here. we can just share information, and thoughts.my questions are what should be reported? buying and selling? report how much you bought them at? and sold them at? what if i didn't sell them? what if i misplaced them? lost them? sold them to a friend?what are our rights?sorry if this is a repost.https://www.coindesk.com/irs-crypto-letter i was wondering where i could purchase bitcoin and be able to instantly transfer it to my private wallet immediate after purchase without paying high fees. anyone ever bought from there? it's the official website isn't it?i usually do a bank transfer to coinbase,  buy bitcoin there and move to my wallet.how does everyone buy? good afternoon everyone.for over a year i have been using the services of the [bitmart.com](https://bitmart.com) exchange. and everything was all right. the work of the exchange suited me perfectly. until recently. i have accumulated a significant amount of usdt there. when withdrawing my funds, i received a message that my account was blocked. i read the official telegram groups and found out that i am not the only one. support in telegram sends people to the blacklist and deletes their messages. therefore, at first glance, the exchange seems very good. i still hope that these problems are temporary and the exchange representative will be able to comment on this and help all of us. [removed] from my limited knowledge, it seems like scalability is one of the largest risks currently posed to bitcoin, yet i haven't found an updated answer to this question online.what is the current status on a scalability solution for bitcoin? if there is no solution and the price appreciates back to the 2017 bull run highs, will we run into problems with transaction fees being too high? is there a way around this? [removed] did not see any comparisons, and honestly dont know which to choose. since both are open source and both are airgapped... any thoughts? starting from block the latest block 638691, bitcoin global, the bitcoin hard fork featuring smaller blocks of 400kb, is finally active. check https://github.com/bitcoin-global/global-plane for references on how to join the community. i have been hodling bitcoin for a long time.it caught my attention back around 2011 when i was in uni. the fact that it was a new technology was good enough for me to start researching it. after a few failed attempts at mining, and when novelty wore off, it kind of drifted away from my mind. the next time it caught my attention was in 2017 - the year of the alts. i finally bought a bit of bitcoin. heck, i even bought a few shitcoins. but i learnt my lesson - bitcoin is gold. again it drifted away from my mind as other pressing issues came up. the recent surge in price has brought me back again. however, i am not going to experiment with defi - i am not smart enough for it.i mean to hodl from now on and keep converting fiat to bitcoin. but, for now i have to liquidate whatever bitcoin i hodl as i have to take care of a few essential payments. so i am selling my gold which is bitcoin.i will start investing as soon as i can in the godl of the future. i was told my stapler would be given back after he was done with it, are there any hw wallets that just looks like a plain ol' usb stick? or you need to put your hw wallet in a fireproof safe bolted to the floor? so i dabble in a options trading and i'm curious what you would all recommend as the best bitcoin platforms. of course there's lots of websites claiming that insert this website is best but i want to know from the community itself what the best platform is.&amp;#x200b;thanks hi i am totally new to bitcoin trading.i had recently started learning about cryptocurrency. so i joined many discord channels of that sort.i received a message on discord which stated that i have been awarded 0.06 btc. the reason being doxcoins.com is new and hence attracting newcomers to trade by offering them free btc. they gifted a total of 2 btc.i am new. so am afraid if this is all fake and risky.can anyone please confirm this?thanks. hello,i've been buying crypto vouchers with my paypal from a site called [dundle.com](https://dundle.com).but unfortunately, it recently stopped supporting my country for some unknown reason.the type of crypto vouchers can be flexepin, cryptovoucher, or bitnova.thanks a lot for any tips! [removed] i just found an old piece of paper with a blockchainbdgpzk login, and i'm trying to access it but i can't get to the site.is it still running? is it possible to create a decentralised government? most definitely  it is. when the right people who understand the idea are in power, then everything is possible. when a certain process in a tax system begins, a society will understand how much they have been robbed by those in power.the system i am writing about will be created from scratch and updated by programmers worldwide, while government officials will be able to enter data into it. it will be necessary to implement a new digital currency with which the new tax system will be linked. digital and national money will coexist and complement each other. i want programmers to have real impact on a national economy by optimising the tax system.i am aware of the consequences of this act, as it boils down to programmers writing the tax law. all you have to do is to give them room for action. politicians have repeatedly proved that they are inept in creating tax law and that they are untrustworthy.my doubts would be whether or not to give them total power over the system, where all changes, by the way of most programmers, are immediately implemented without consulting the authorities.in fact, we do not need geniuses with academic titles before their names in power, but people who can tell good from bad, truth from lies, grain from chaff.i think this is a direction worth taking, and i hope that there will be people interested in creating such a system, whether or not your efforts ever see the light of day.&amp;#x200b;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppfhqxvem6q hello,if you got issues trusting others, i'll screenshot your transaction on my console showing all the details (number of confirmations, address, amount)this is literally means you got into the bank vault and looked for your account, opened the compartment and saw/counted your own money!&amp;#x200b;i'll need the transaction id and blockhash (click on the block id on blockchair.com for it to appear)drop your anonymous name and details here: [http://www.disposablechat.com/](http://www.disposablechat.com/)room name: gettransactionchoose any username you want.

"virtual contract? what is even that?".  they want something signed by pen. all this damn hassle just to receive and use my hard-earned money as i see fit.but today, i'm free.bitcoin is the true breaker of chains, and the only way forward. hello guys, have you find any method to buy polkadot using btc?any suggestion? thanks i'm a bitcoin expert but i just want to see if there's something i'm missing.what is the point of a dusting attack? when the "attacker" sends .00000547 btc to you. it seems pointless to me. if they wanted to track you, couldn't they just track your address activity on the blockchain, with no need to dust?i want to spend the dust to do my part in helping utxo bloat. i could see where if you spent the dust, that might give a slight indicator as to what wallet software you're using, e.g. whether its a wallet with good utxo control, but other than that it seems that dusting attacks are pointless.thoughts?

-we are excited to launch the financement! our free newsletter will provide readers with insight into current financial research. we aspire to help bridge the gap between academia and industry, providing complex financial research to the everyday reader. every other week, well be sending an easy to read summary of a financial research paper critical to recent events directly to your inbox. if youre interested in signing up and want to learn more click the link down below.https://www.subscribepage.com/the-financement-news i was wondering if anyone has had luck with traditional bank lenders and proving you have funds to cover your mortgage showing bitcoin or cryptocurrencies as an asset. i dont want to convert my btc to fiat.i'm going to refinance my home and also purchase a home soon. lenders usually ask for proof of stocks, bonds, assets, checking savings accounts to see your total 'net worth' for real estate loans.i was just wondering if my cryptos could be considered part of my net worth and if banks will accept this. if not i might have to liquidate my cryptos and put in a bank savngs account [removed] :) live in the now :) this was originally an answer to a question that was asked here, but op deleted their post.this might help some newbies (especially the multisig edit at the end), so i want to make sure it's still accessible here.the original question was whether the electrum wallet stores a trezor's private key when using a passphrase.op noticed that his trezor wouldn't connect to his electrum wallet when entering a different passphrase than he used when creating the wallet. thus, op (likely) assumed that the wallet stored the private key, as it somehow knew that a different private key was now used.here is my original answer (with some modifications):**important: i'm assuming here that you connected your trezor by choosing the "hardware wallet" option in electrum, rather than giving electrum your 12/24 seed words.***tl;dr: no, your coins are safe :)*i'm assuming by [passphrase](https://wiki.trezor.io/multi-passphrase_encryption_(hidden_wallets))   you mean the 25th (or 13th) word. when you have this feature enabled, a private key gets generated every time you enter a passphrase. when you enter the same passphrase you used to create the wallet, the wallet with your funds shows up.whenever you enter something different, a different private key is generated on your trezor. this allows you to have multiple different wallets for example, by choosing the passphrases "first wallet", "second wallet", "third wallet", or a secret wallet   with a secret passphrase.so whenever you enter a new passphrase when connecting your trezor to electrum, the trezor will send a new *public* key to electrum. electrum will then derive addresses from this public key and check those for balances. it won't find any, as you used a new passphrase.edit: i just realized that you said your wallet doesn't *connect* to electrum when you use a different passphrase. this is simply because electrum doesn't receive the correct public key from the trezor and  therefore electrum thinks it's a different wallet (which it is).when you enter the passphrase you used during creation of your wallet, the trezor will send your actual public key to electrum, which will then find addresses with balances, which it will show to you. edit (to clarify): connecting your trezor after creating the wallet is only necessary to send funds or verify addresses, as the public key is already stored in the wallet.dat.the only thing electrum actually stores is the public key, which can only be used to look at your  bitcoin, not to move them. you might want to keep this public key a secret as well though, since it links all your funds to you. this is what electrum stores in the wallet.dat file, which you can just encrypt by choosing a password for it.well done using a passphrase by the way! should someone get their hands on your trezor, a sophisticated attacker can get the secret key off the device [in 15 minutes](https://blog.kraken.com/post/3662/kraken-identifies-critical-flaw-in-trezor-hardware-wallets/). using a passphrase makes this attack almost useless, as the both secret key and the passphrase are needed to move your funds, and the passphrase is not stored on the device. a passphrase also allows you to hide funds from potential robbers that force you to unlock your wallet.you can do this by activating the passphrase feature and sending your funds to a wallet with a secret passphrase (**do not lose this**, as losing your passphrase renders your funds inaccessible).  afterwards, you can safely deactivate the passphrase feature, so the device doesn't even ask for one should you get robbed.edit: should you be worried that you might forget your passphrase, you should look into [multisig](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/multisignature) wallets. depending on how you set this up,  you can make it more secure against theft *and* less likely for you to lose access to your funds.say for example you get four wallets: two hardware wallets, a well-protected (airgapped) laptop with electrum, and a secure mobile wallet that allows for multisig (like [fully noded](https://fullynoded.app/)).you can then create a 2-of-4 multisig wallet that requires you to sign transactions with any two of these four wallets.the increase in security comes from the fact that an attacker now needs full access to two of your devices (or their stored private keys) at once.at the same time, the fact that you yourself now also need access to only half of your devices means that in the event of a total loss of one (or even two) of them, you can still move your funds to a new wallet.as long as you do regular checks (e.g. first day of each month), ensuring that you still have access to all your devices' stored private keys, you can always catch a loss of keys and fix this without losing funds (by creating a new multisig wallet and sending the funds there).this allows you to use a passphrase on your wallets without storing it *anywhere* physically or digitally. this would usually be very risky, as forgetting the passphrase would lead to a loss of funds, but this risk is now close to eliminated.*(the following part was not in the original answer)*some **important** general secruity tips:1. consider running your own full node and [electrum server](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx) ([also check the alternatives](https://blockstream.com/2020/06/16/en-esplora-and-other-alternatives-to-electrumx/)), which you connect your electrum wallet to. this ensures that you don't send your public key to anyone else. if someone knows your public key, they know how much btc you own, making you a potential target.2. always encrypt your wallet.dat (or whatever you called your wallet file), even if it's a watch-only wallet. this protects your public key (see 1. for why you want that).3. create watch-only wallets: use an [airgapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_gap_(networking)) device to create a wallet with electrum (make sure to back up the seed phrase) and [export the public key](https://support.node40.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010314848-exporting-your-electrum-master-public-key-). then [create a new watch-only wallet](https://bitcoinelectrum.com/creating-a-watch-only-wallet/) on another device (like your everyday laptop) with that public key to be able to check your funds. (to create the initial wallet, you can also use any other hard- or software wallet that allows you to export the master public key.)4. keep some funds on your hardware wallets. if an attackers sees funds on the wallets, they might not force you to enter a passphrase or ask if you have any multisig wallets (lying under pressure is hard).5. hide all your wallets in different places. if someone sees that you have multiple wallets lying around, they might realize you have a multisig wallet.6. don't risk a robber getting (for example) two keys to your 2-of-4 multisig wallet and then racing him to move your funds with the other two keys when they leave. they're gonna come back and be pissed. if it comes to this, you need protection until the robber is caught. *stay safe!*7. the easiest way to solve a problem is to never have it. don't make yourself a target. if nobody even *suspects* you have a multisig (or any wallet at all), they're not gonna look for it.*please correct any mistakes you find and i will edit my post. i will also gladly add more tips to the list. i will of course credit anyone who helps.****tip for devs who want something cool and important to work on:*** make the creation of multisig wallets as noob-friendly as possible. if someone expresses worries about losing access to their funds by forgetting the seed phrase, wallet pin, etc. (someone in my family actually brought this up to me), multisig wallets are the perfect solution as they add redundancy. [removed] i use bitstamp (eu exchange), which doesn't have a system for recurring buy orders.i really like the [low trading fees](https://www.bitstamp.net/fee-schedule/) (though there is a 0.0005 btc withdrawal fee), so i want to use bitstamp for my recurrent buy orders. i already [wrote the code](https://github.com/fittiboy/autocoin) to immediately turn any fiat into btc and withdraw it to any given address.at the moment, i don't have a guide on how to use it, but it's very simple and if you know python you should be able to figure it out *really* quickly.a noob-friendly guide will be added to [the readme.md](https://github.com/fittiboy/autocoin#autocoin) soon, and i will also make a more detailed post here on r/bitcoin when the project is "done" (i will look into feature requests, etc. via the github issue tracker).hint: you can run the script on an always-on machine (like a raspberry pi you can ssh into) like this \`yes | python autocoin.py\` (piping yes skips confirmation, not sure if \`yes\` is available on windows) and change the withdrawal address while the script is still running via \`python setadd.py\`.***keep in mind:*** *the script is very aggressive and while running will immediately try to buy as much btc as possible with your available fiat via instant order. it will also immediately try to withdraw all your btc to whatever address is in the \`address.json\` file. this will happen* ***without asking for confirmation****, should you use the \`yes\` method described above.* the buffett indicator has hit levels unseen since the dot-com bubble,  and bitcoin could see a major reaction in the event of a major crash in  stocks.&amp;#x200b;## does this provide any glimpse into bitcoins long-term trend?according  to tom essaye, the founder of sevens report research, stocks are  considered as fundamentally overvalued when the buffett indicator hits  1.3.the current level of 1.7 indicates that there is a  potential for a steep downtrend in the stock market if the trend  reverses. he explained: with btc entering the multi year bull market, it is worth waiting for a correction to at least below 10 k to buy crypto?or its never be going that low?just trying to buy the dip i want to test my 24 word seed in electrum, would i be jeopardizing its privacy if i use tails, not connected to the internet, and try to recover it, seeing if the public master key matches? so i've decided to store some bitcoins on a paper wallet so that i can bury the seed phrase somewhere on this planet and dig it up if i ever have to. anyways, i still don't understand it all fully. i investigated a bit and found out that i should create a wallet on an offline computer and all that stuff. so my understanding is that i get a public key (a wallet code that i use to send money to it?) and a private key (used to access the wallet?). i understand that i can send the money to the wallet via public key (i guess), but how would i send the money from that paper wallet if i ever need it? how are the fees and confirmations going to work? is it a must to use bip39 standard or can i use any words (from my own language)? if i can use any words, where do i enter them and what software do i use for it? should i maybe write down the private key instead of using a seed phrase? is [bitaddress.org](https://bitaddress.org) suitable for using seed phrase that i want?sorry if these were already answered (i bet they were) but i'm just so confused and decided to write a post. thanks in advance to everyone that is willing to help! [removed] i'm enetered in this new world a few months ago. some of my friends, "veteran" in this world, suggest me to enter in this two reality.mindcapitalmirrortrading internationalonline research, for me, are so confused and i dont't understand where is  the truth.can you help me?ps: sorry for the scary english,but its not my first language. i sold half my bitcoin at 62k brl and right now its around 65k, having peaked at 67.i feel like i'll be losing money if i buy again at this price but i also dont want to miss out from the gains if it never drops again below that price i sold.what should i do? is it just gambling at this point? is it worth to buy rn? would it drop below 10k usd ever again?thanks hello,i've connected electrum to my trezor, but whenever i log in and put a passphrase different than the one that was initially chosen when creating the wallet file, it doesn't connect to electrum. does that mean the electro wallet file contain my passphrase? encrypted or not. [removed] i don't understand why so many altcoins went all red just because btc couldn't stay above $12k. i still find myself new to crypto so sorry if the question is too dumb. i couldn't find an answer on google. i've definitely give this food for thought before, but now i feel like i need to get a little more serious with it...how do you plan to pass your bitcoin onto your heirs??  i had read before about someone having a will/trust/whatever that listed half of the key, and then another document that would point to a safety deposit box that had the other half of the key.  otherwise, how else can you pass it on???  nobody's gonna know your passwords, keys, etc.this guy told me he had a lot of btc that he could retire off of.   poof.  gone forever.   i know haters gonna hate, but i feel like this is one area that paper wallets really are the best.  just my opinion, at least... so, ive been buying bitcoin since 2017. i thought i was late and have heard people say the same who got in 2013. maybe everybody thinks theyre late? although in hindsight it feels like it would have been so easy to buy btc when is was cheap. i ran some numbers to find out how it would have felt if i has found btc 4 years earlier. similar buys, similar time span. turns out its more or less identical. so right now im actually a mofo with insignificant btc stack in 2016, about to experience 2017 but not aware of it. this is an encouragement for every newbie. just start! everybody once felt like you!http://er-bybitcoin.com/moonmath/ [removed] what kind of economy will we have once bitcoin has drain all the capital from all other asset classes?stagnation?end of boom an bust?reduction in house prices?what do you think? sunlight investments group on telegram. can anyone tell if this group is legit or a scam? [removed] [removed] so i can buy more.. hey all,i've been using bittr for a while before it shut down. in short, it was a super lightweight service where you register a bitcoin address with your bank account (iban) and whenever you throw money at their bank address, they would send btc to your wallet. no web wallet bullshit. it was a perfect tool for recurring purchases (i.e. for dca). i've been looking for a comparable service since they've shut down in may 2020.so my question is, does anyone know a good service for monthly buys so i can save up some sats? i know that coinbase is offering recurring buys but i dont want to support them, so i'd appreciate other services! btw, i live in europe. [removed] [removed] [removed] i've seen some things that blockstream is funded by bad actors who are intentionally trying to slowly destroy bitcoin and profit off of it as much as they can. i'm wondering if there's a grain of truth to this? my thoughts are everything is open source and if that was the case we could fork over to a new chain. however we would lack the network effects and security of the main chain of miners didn't want to switch over. i'm planning on digging into this a bit, but wanted to hear some thoughts on it before i do. a little bit about me:\-i'm currently 17 but have parental permission to use stock trading (i'm using cashapp and have a quarter share of apple right now)\-i'm broke but work 6 days a week\-i leave for the military soon so if there's something i can do that'll be long-term that would be great!&amp;#x200b;now, i've heard so much about bitcoin and i want to get my hands dirty with it. i have a budget of about $300-400 but note that i do have a decent gaming rig. i7-8700 (6 cores) and a 1060 with 3 gigs of ram. (i know my gpu is pretty dog sh\*t) (i plan on upgrading at some point)as of right now i have probably gambled around $400 (in losses) and i'm going to stop and try to better myself for something long term instead of being stupid and trying to make fast cash.are there any websites/downloads that can help me out with mining bitcoin? what should i do with the money i'm willing to spend (the $300 or so)?and most importantly, how much and how long do you think it'd take for me to start making back the $400 i've lost because of my stupid actions.i'm grateful for any help i can receive. thank you all\-jay [removed] running electrum 3.3.8 on my laptop, &amp; trying to do a paper wallet sweep with my android airgapped. to send elsewhere. so on the laptop i setup the transaction, set the fees ,( it's unsigned watch only. i click the qr code &amp; hold my phone up &amp; the electrum on my phone says unable to decode qr data. i'm a bit nervous. so i look in the block explorer &amp; my funds are still on the paper wallet nothing sent. however. if i uninstall electrum on my phone &amp; laptop &amp; turn my phones connection back on to sweep another, less safe airgapped way, is electrum going to make the transaction happen that still hasn't. if that makes any sense. please help. why is it not able to decode the transaction qr code so it can get signed?? [removed] i want to buy some alt coins that are in top 50 of coinmarketcap. it seems like coinbase only have a selected few coins and so does gemini. are there any other exchanges that operate in new york with bit license that allows to trade many different alt coins? i did some googling and bittrex seems like another option but im confused because i get a message saying that they dont operate in my area. should i try it on a different computer? any insights would be appreciated.tldr: where can i buy alt coins in ny other than cb and gemini. thanks. [removed] [removed] [removed] so ive been investing for awhile and have made some nice returns on alts such as hbar, icx, ltc, xrp. ive been here since 2017, what a ride its been.i would admit that i quit the crypto world generally because i was tired of the trading aspect, i genuinely valued time outside more than researching.i still feel a similar way and need to find a legitimate investing mentor. where can i find trustworthy mentors to help me invest a large sum for returns in the 5-7x range that could be withdrawn in a years time?i dont want to miss this ride, ive already missed from 3k to 8k and completely missed link and omg. two choices that were so easy to make. [removed] hey r/cryptocurrency !i am new to bitcoin and don't really understand all this stuff. basically there is this app i want to buy, but it costs around 15$ in bitcoin. i was wondering how i could get started bitcoin mining. i have a mid range gaming gpu and electricity is free. also, how long do you think it will take to mine 15$ of bitcoin? thank you! [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] ive heard about this project a while back and didnt do enough research into their development and the growth it could have and here we are after the denomination. price has dropped and supply has increased with a market cap that is top 10 in the first few days.their ecosystem is rolling out main nets and use cases for defi, iot and interoperability almost in conjunction with the launch of denomination.describe what you like or ask the community for more information about what interests or excites you because i for one am actually really excited to see this project grow! welcome to the daily discussion. please read the disclaimer, guidelines, and rules before participating.***-**disclaimer:**though karma rules still apply, moderation is less stringent on this thread than on the rest of the sub. therefore, consider all information posted here with several liberal heaps of salt, and always cross check any information you may read on this thread with known sources. any trade information posted in this open thread may be highly misleading, and could be an attempt to manipulate new readers by known "pump and dump (pnd) groups" for their own profit. beware of such practices and exercise utmost caution before acting on any trade tip mentioned here.***-**rules:*** all [sub rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/about/rules/) apply in this thread. the prior exemption for karma and age requirements is no longer in effect.* discussion topics must be related to cryptocurrency.* comments will be sorted by newest first.***-**to see prior skeptics discussions, [click here](https://old.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/search?q=title%3a%22monthly+skeptics+discussion%22+&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).** [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] there was a token i remember learning about a long time ago, cant remember its name!might have been a stable coin or a lending platformexample:you swap xusd for yusd and the exchange rate is set to go up some tiny amount like 0.0002% per second so that when you decide to convert yusd back into xusd you have earned exactly some specific yearly interest rate. yusd i think only exists for this purpose.does this sound like any specific tokens you know of?are there any stable coins that do something like this that have a built in interest rate that is earned for simply swapping and holding on to the secondary token for a period of time?thanks [removed] hi all, i have been researching for the past half hour and used the search bar but could not find an answer to my question.what im looking for is an exchange that offers the buying and selling of eth options, preferable american-style. most exchanges i found either dont allow selling of options, or dont offer eth.does anyone know of any such exchange? [removed] if any of you are interested in learning how trading against btc or eth works (as opposed to stablecoins or fiat) then check out this video here:[https://youtu.be/gsikgooslte](https://youtu.be/gsikgooslte)in the video i show you how the numbers are derived because they can be confusing to understand especially when you're just starting out. [removed] long story short, i wound up transferring a small amount of crypto into coinbene to trade with a specific crypto they support, however im now realizing im not going to be able to transfer back out to my wallet without doing the full photo id verification and such. ive seen a lot of sketchy stuff on them, so im a bit hesitant to upload personal info to them like that. anyone have any experience with them? trying to decide if i should just take the small bath on the coin i have on their or if its worth verifying with them. [removed] -today's crypto of the day is oceanex token (oce), and it's current price is $0.0039.-since 2/18/20, every day i have featured a new crypto of the day for us to discuss. i try to make follow up posts within a week, but i am behind at the moment. i try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. sometimes i even feature projects i personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. i feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. at this point, i plan to try to continue making these posts until i have completed a full year.-if you decide to reply, please add something more than, "scam" or "this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020". please say why. if it is a scam, link or show evidence. if you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? it seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags.-i strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. there is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. you may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. i know i certainly did!https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/search?q=author%3ajoenorwood77&amp;restrict_sr=on-these posts are not meant to be financial advice, but instead to be an educational discussion. everyone is responsible for doing their own research. [removed] i have a ledger nano that i use with ledger live mostly. i sometimes use mew but recently i wanted to change the token contract address with a token that has done a swap. so i had to use mew and add a token, then follow the basic steps... anyway my new tokens do not show up in mew. i realized the address in my mew is different than they eth address that i usually send tokens to on my ledger nano. how can i change it to direct it to that specific address. when i tried it leads to hundreds of other addresses that mew generates from the ledger i guess? how can i pick the address i want? sorry this is probably very basic but i have trouble checking the oil in my car without a manual. [removed] [removed] [removed] you don't have to be a financial expert to make intuitive trading decisions, or make money off dips. the 10% rule is easily applicable to any given coin, and should be used as a starting reference frame when evaluating "which coin should i buy / sell / convert?" it's easy &amp; takes only seconds.**on any given coin, just move the decimal over one spot to the left.**^ it seems obvious, but that is how much the coin needs to move for you to get 10% roi. what you do with that information is more important. the 10% rule is a short-run strategy, and synergizes well with long hodl strategies.if a coin has a **low 10%** :* when markets are bullish you buy in or convert into for faster 10% roi* when markets are bearish you sell these first or convert into coins with high 10%if a coin has a **high 10%**:* when markets are bullish you hold or convert from these coins to a lower 10% for better roi* when markets are bearish you hold these coins longer.* a rule of thumb for when to sell your high 10% coins is to divide by 2, and if the price falls that amount--convert or selli'll give some real world examples from my trades last night for decision making.i look at btc and see that it takes $1,150 to gain 10% and that it's been hitting a lot of resistance at $12,000. so i knew instantly that "unless btc reaches $12,650 i'm not getting 10% roi &amp; people are fighting hard over it"i take a look at band and i see it takes $1.01 to gain 10% and that it's hit $15 in the last week. that told me when things get bullish, the gains would be higher / faster if i bought in. there's a little ta involved to confirm momentum trends, but you should see the intuition here.when i looked at link i saw it takes $1.30 to gain 10% and that it's hit $20 in the last week. i took my same link bag that i converted to stablecoins a week ago ( @ ~$19.00) &amp; reinvested them into the coin at a ~35% discount which is now up 20%. i only plan to hold my new link bag as long as the bullishness continues, which i use a little ta to confirm.anyone can do this. there's nothing wrong with long hodl'ing, but there's just so much more to be gained with a short-run strategy and a long run strategy. hopefully this helps someone in the short run! [removed] i don't know a whole lot about nano, which is why i'm asking you to change my view. i want to believe in instant, fee-less transactions with 0 inflation, but the problems seem to outweigh the benefits.**just 11 accounts own over one-third of the nano stake, and two accounts have a third of the stake delegated to them.** [(source)](https://weisscrypto.com/en/article/nano-a-tall-promise-of-radical-decentralization-and-scalability-betrayed#:~:text=nano%20%e2%80%94%20a%20tall%20promise%20of%20radical%20decentralization%20and%20scalability%20betrayed,-by%20juan%20villaverde&amp;text=nano%20)this small group of people has no incentive to be honest. this supposedly decentralized network relies on just a few people to act in the best interests of the network with no incentive not to do the opposite.i don't think that a crypto should have to rely on people doing the right thing for it to work. gold doesn't rely on people to do the right thing. bitcoin doesn't rely on people to do the right thing (with the exception of 51% attacks, which at this point are practically impossible). a currency should be absolute, not dependent on a regulatory body (especially not one this small). i just can't see a system like this working on a large scale.change my view.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i'm not exactly a veteran, but after 3 years in this game i wanted to offer some advice for any newbies here:1. don't do your own research. just ask someone on reddit what to invest in. they will be happy to help and it will save you a lot of time and hard work.2. always invest more than you can afford to lose. if you don't have enough money, try to take out a loan.3. when your hairdresser/ mechanic/ aunt wilma tells you they've just bought bitcoin, you know it's time to max out those credit cards (if for some inexplicable reason you haven't already) and go all in!4. want to double your holdings? go on twitter and you will find plenty of celebrities who are willing to give you back double whatever you send them. i shit you not.5. don't take profits (in the unlikely event that you have any profits after following the above advice). instead, hodl your coins all the way from the top of the bull down to the bottom of the bear. when you're approximately 95% in the red and everyone is saying 'bitcoin is dead' it's finally time to give up and sell. but fear not- your sacrifice will signal the beginning of the next great bullrun.6. and finally, (as you will no longer have money left for a car *or* a haircut) make sure you wait for your aunt wilma to give you the buy signal before you re-enter the market, telling yourself you've learned from all your previous mistakes and will definitely *not* be making those same mistakes again.have i forgotten anything? feel free to share your words of wisdom in the comments below. i think we often overstate how much selling pressure there is on bitcoin. the order books are so thin on the sell side that bulls could easily push this to 100k, but the problem is that there just isn't enough new money flowing in. some nstitutions are buying bitcoin, but they are obtaining it in ways that doesnt pump the price. whenever bitcoin does start to set all time highs, expect another exponential run up like 2017. i think we often overstate how much selling pressure there is on bitcoin. the order books are so thin on the sell side that bulls could easily push this to 100k, but the problem is that there just isn't enough new money flowing in. some nstitutions are buying bitcoin, but they are obtaining it in ways that doesnt pump the price. whenever bitcoin does start to set all time highs, expect another exponential run up like 2017. may not be for the extremely principled og's in the crypto space in terms of "not your keys not your coins", however celsius is laying down a serious challenge to the transitional banking system. join me for a deep dive into celsius network who put the community first and are disrupting the traditional banking sector.

[http://smartestman.ca/1974](http://smartestman.ca/1974) explains. learning about bitcoin lead me to learn about economics and stuffs. which has lead into openning my eyes on the reality of the current system we have today. and why and how bitcoin aims to solve this.i mean like it was too much for me handle, this lockdown periods gave me more time to learn about this stuffs, every single day i realize more how broken the current world we live in. it's very depressing. maybe not depressed really just upset.the feeling when you finally learned that most problems society faces today stems from the fact we don't have sound money and that it is the governments that are the real enemy, it's like you wanna start a revolution or something. but then again most people still believed that what money is for the governments to decide.at this point i feel like i need to do something for bitcoin to succeed, to atleast contribute to its success. you know that feeling where you wanna tell everyone how cool it is and how it solves pretty much everything.i've tried it before and none of em cared or probably misunderstood it maybe its also because on my end not being able to explain it properly, idk i was pretty new to bitcoin that time and overly enthusiastic about it.i feels like it's just all conspiracy to them. that were the ones that are brainwashed. idk what to do next at this point. i do buy bitcoin regularly already, not sure if that's enough.. it sucks i don't have much free time to devote into contributing to bitcoin. bitcoin is just numbers and letters. bitcoin should be protected under freedom of speech. it shouldn't be taxed. if they tax cryptocurrency, they can tax free speech in the future. serious proposition. imagine if one btc was 50 usd. wed all be moonianaires in a matter of a few weeks.our current holdings as a percentage of total holdings would remain unchanged, everything will be the same on a practical level. if i buy 500$ worth of bitcoin and move it to a private wallet will the bitcoin in my wallet increase at the same time when the bitcoin market increases?

[removed] in that light, will bitcoin be a source of unity or division to achieve optimal levels of human cooperation and collaboration between the human actors who play on top of it? every wallet scans a sequence of btc addresses in order to retrieve the total balance. for example, the default scan value in electrum is 20, but this can be manually increased.now let's suppose we have a gap limit set only to **5**:3|0|0|2|0|0|0|0|0***|0|7***what is the consequence of this?the addresses in bold are not counted if the gap limit is 5.because the wallet only shows **5 (3+2)** instead of ***12(3+2+7)***. we can simply overcome this by manually increasing the gap limit, in this case 20 is enough.now, let us suppose we receive a payment to a btc address which is **very very far** from the latest one counted. let's say for example someone sends to the 99999999-th indexed btc address (this is deterministically generated by the xpub and it is correct) some coins.honestly, i do not know the outcome of this, but in the best outcome we should wait a crazy amount of time to see the total balance, or the network may interpret this as a ddos attack and we can be blocked.giving this situation, if i know the btc address am i able to spend those coins instead of scanning the entire sequence of addresses? i want to share it, maybe someone really needs it? like and comment l. write who really needs help and why and maybe you will get btc from me [removed] maybe bitcoin will be worth $ 40,000 you can believe it i have to sell some things online and the lowest fee comes if i sell it and get btc but i'm not from that world so i have no ideas how it works...i know that there are several ways (online/software/hardware...) but i would prefer online so what's the best way (site) to create a bitcoin wallet/address? coinbase/blockchain... what else exists? bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency or digital currency. it was launched in 2009 by satoshi nakamoto. now a day, it is considered as the future of money...and relaible as gold...read more[bitcoin](https://www.themaintained.com/passive-income/what-is-bitcoin-why-we-need-it/) take a look current state of btc atm's in openstreetmap: [https://i.imgur.com/68tkp5p.png](https://i.imgur.com/68tkp5p.png)or run query yourself: (please don't do "reddit hug of death):&gt;!https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/xj1!&lt;openstreetmap being open platform for mapping the world (from countries to streets to hiking roads to benches or even trash cans) seems in the same open nature like bitcoin is.so, please consider contributing bitcoin atm's to openstreetmap database!you can do that using [https://www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org) editor (create account and press edit), or install mobile editing app like [vespucci](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/vespucci) (or [others](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/editors)), or full-powered [josm](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) (for desktop).check openstreetmap [wiki page about atm](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/tag:amenity%3datm). basically it's "amenity=atm" with "currency:btc=yes". add other appropriate tags too, like operator, other currencies and others.yes, i know we have [https://coinatmradar.com/](https://coinatmradar.com/) (and maybe others), but these closed/proprietary sites might go "out of business" any time and we will lose all the data. meanwhile, you can host your own osm server if you will! if all alt coins are converted to btc? i now have 0.014 btc and tomorrow ill have around 0.025.it's not much but i'm getting there slowly hi, i'm a software developer and i would like to validade an idea and get some feeback from the community regarding a particular website i'm thinking of.do you think you would use/visit a website that uses artificial intelligence to forecast the price of bitcoin? sort of like a weather forecast site, but for crypto. the site would also bring together the latest news and maybe apply some sentiment analysis on the news text, so that you can have a feel of the market for that day at a glimpse without having to dive into heavy technical graphs and charts. something like this:(mock)https://preview.redd.it/n0uuh2blcri51.png?width=1205&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=173f4352bf14ad4de83cbb88b10afee670411aabif you think this is a good idea, would you let me know? your feedback is very much appreaciated.

(they are a taker)* if a seller places a market order, they will get the bid price. (they are a taker)* if a buyer places a limit order, if it's fulfilled, they will pay the bid price they set. (they are a maker)* if a seller places a limit order, if it's fulfilled, they will get the ask price they set. (they are a maker)* so the spread essentially reflects the limit orders on the books.i read somewhere that exchanges make money off of the spread  the difference between the ask and bid price. how does this work??when looking at the value of btc, you usually just see a *ticker* price. does this more closely resemble the current ask price, or the current bid price, or somewhere in between? why? *bitcoin is declining and trading well below the $12,000 pivot  level against the us dollar. btc must stay above the $11,100 support  zone to start a fresh increase in the near term.*&amp;#x200b;* bitcoin is struggling to recover and it is trading well below $12,000 and $11,800.* the price is currently holding a couple of strong supports above $11,350 and $11,100.* there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with  resistance near $11,610 on the 4-hours chart of the btc/usd pair (data  feed from kraken).* the pair is struggling to recover above $11,700 and it is trading well below the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). i just got my first ever bitcoin by receiving it by coinbase wallet. but i noticed that other wallet app have more features like customize transaction fee and price track. i type my private key into bitpay and blockchain wallet none of them are showing my balance like in coinbase wallet. i just started using bitcoin as i use to buy some stuff and all from nulled. but then i wondered when i created my blockchain wallet it asked me for kyc and an id card for verification. so if my account is kyc verified, can i still call it untraceable?? as i heard that you cant track bitcoin wallet owners from its address, so why is there even a need for kyc.and secondly is there any other wallet available there which can provide me full functionality without kyc or id verification.thanks for your time. i need a wallet that doesnt require government id and stuff hello everyone,my name is natalie and my husband and i discovered the identity of the man who utilized the alias "satoshi nakamoto"; the founder of bitcoin and whose involvement with the creation of the blockchain has changed the world for better. i'm here to ask the community two simple questions:1. can my family and i benefit, financially, from releasing this information?2. if we decide to release the information regarding the actuality of his identity, what would be the consequences of doing so in regards of the man himself and/or his work?i'd like to sum up the reason why my husband and i are asking these questions: my husband and i decided to seek 'satoshi's' identity in the hopes of contacting him and in exchange for handing over our gathered information, his collective footprint(s), and network of data in which assisted with the conclusion of his identity, he'd assist us with my family's financial burden(s) regarding my daughter's medical expenses and consequential livelihood expenditures.my daughter is a toddler and suffers from trigeminal neuralgia; she needs a microvascular decompression procedure and we cannot afford it due to the loss of our health insurance, my husband's occupation due to the covid-epidemic, and we have utilized nearly all of our financial leverage already on related medical expenditures.to be clear, we are not using this as a platform for charity. we'll share no contact information openly, there will be no "donate to our wallet" nonsense, and this isn't my real name and my husband's identity will not be shared either. we have this information, in which we've successfully verified, and we intended on having dialog with "satoshi" but have since been unsuccessful with. the only response was a denial - any and all follow-up communication(s) have been ignored. we feel like our backs are against the wall and would appreciate any and all input concerning where to go from here.this venture my husband and i decided to task ourselves with lasted eight (8) days before the suspected identity had far too much correlative data with "satoshi" that any additional gathered information would have been unnecessary. we're both professionally adapted with informational gathering and the legalities of discovery so it's important to note that all information gathered on the suspect's identity and his correlation with the alias "satoshi nakamoto" was obtained through legal, open sourced means of free tools and techniques available to every one. we were not intrusive nor did we pry into any unethical means of research. the closest advocates of research we utilized within our conclusive portion of our document was sharing third-party correlative data with an "torrent-invite" hack from 2013 in which we found publicly available.the man who owned the alias of "satoshi nakamoto" is younger than suspect. he is of asian decent (chinese, not japanese)  and a united kingdom citizen. he went to a u.k. university and took photographs for his university's paper/year-end book(s). he plays the piano, likes cats, worked and briefly lived on the west coast of the united states of america, is still heavily involved in decentralization and foss projects. he is, also, unquestionably remarkable and intelligent for hiding in plain-sight and for his past and current projects.we admire him sincerely - which is why it's important that you all answer as honestly as possible concerning the consequences of releasing this information. we are not malevolent people nor can we allow this information to negatively impact the man in any sense of the imagination. we haven't found any warrants or bounties, government agencies, corporations or organizations (etc), wanting to know his current whereabouts for negative reasons. but, if we are wrong, please let us know by means of messaging here or simply posting on his posting because we will not release any information to anyone whatsoever if the slightest harm or negative inquiry is caused on the man. we can deal with the inconvenience of exposure (we are near bankruptcy and our daughter means everything to us) as a consequence of our information being released, but nothing else.any and all information concerning the inquiry of our gathered information can and will be shared by private means of communication. if there aren't sincere liabilities concerning his welfare as a result of our research being released and if someone and/or an organization that would like to help us out in exchange for said information, then we'd love to do so as formally as possible, whether through an escrow exchange to insure the buyer of the information is satisfied with our finding(s), or through any other private means of exchange.we are not interested in any media interviews, random questions, publicity or any self-indulgence through the exposure of the man's identity. we'll remain anonymous and would love for every one to respect our plea for anonymity.feel free to private message us for further information. thank you.natalie the main (imo) two attractions to bitcoin are 1) its capped supply and 2) its decentralized nature. however, couldnt this lead to chaos should, for example, large institutions such as a national banks buy a overwhelming majority of the bitcoin supply? if vast supply of bitcoin is purchased by central powers, which is conceivable due to its inherent limited supply, wouldnt they be able to control its distribution and availability? thanks so i want to swap eth for btc every week or so like cost averaging i used changelly but i want to know is there a better place to do that! does anyone want to do the research for me?  i remember reading a post by jameson loop where he listed the steps to really set up a privacy-heavy account with casa.  i remember that you would use a email with an alias, use your own node that you obtain that is not linked to you, vpn, tor and such....i thought it was at his casa blog, but i really do not see it there, maybe it is.thanks! i am some random redditor, remember. this is my opinion.but with a 21,000,000 max supply i cannot comprehend how bitcoin will possibly not absolutely sky rocket. if only 0.25% of the world's population wanted to buy 1 btc, that would completely cover the entire supply of bitcoin.with the technology of the block chain and the exponential rise of technology, i cannot possibly fathom how bitcoin could not continue to climb in the following decades.there are so many variables but bitcoin seems so fundamentally flawless in principle.am i missing something here?every day that goes past i am saddened by the fact that i don't make enough to invest considerable amounts. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] as it stands, what are the biggest roadblocks to doing something like this on the ethereum network? are there other networks that would be better suited for this (i.e. those that can store data for significantly cheaper and process small interactions such as upvoting posts with almost no fees, with good scalability). are there any good projects in this vein currently in progress?

[removed] [removed] this is a true story and i finally decided to share it with you. i hope that it will travel beyond this community. eventually, it will convince more people about the necessity of getting a clear run at our corrupt and inefficient financial system through cryptography and decentralization.i am a manager in an italian company and, on the 14th of july, i was informed by our accountant that an officer of a bank were customer of lost 53 promissory notes, for a total of  308.688,13= (see document attached of their report of dismay). since the term in all those notes was expired, the sums had been already credited by the bank, as it should be when an iou is due and theres capacity in the debtors bank account.the money was gone in the creditors accounts and, right after, the papers were lost. what can ever happen? using some good sense, one might think that its the officers fault and, probably, they have insurance for covering these cases of human (and quite absurd) error. no way! they opted for another, easier strategy: \*\*on the 8th of july, they literally took back the money from our account, after almost 3 months that the amount was duly accredited!\*\*thank god, our accountant detected the theft (how else should i call it?) and asked for clarification. what if she didnt notice? the banks reply, however, was embarrassing: lost iou charge (yes, literally 3 words in caps and with the attached document you can see).sure, im aware that banks did way more than stealing 300k after stupidly losing a box full of promissory notes. its the principle that - nave me - once away shocks me, together with the behavior of the bank: an institution which, secure to stay unpunished, doesnt even bother to spend more than 3 words of reply (after theyve been caught). for the chronicles, we are still trying to get the money back.whatever cryptocurrency you are sustaining, we are all the bricks of a better future. its time that technology and our awareness put an end to this inefficient and corrupt monetary-financial model. its time to move on and let the people be the real owners of the value they produce and hold. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] first off, lets acknowledge that im a dumb idiot who did a dumb thing - have a chuckle at my navety, take a moment to reflect on the superiority of your judgement - and lets move past it.in short, because my checking account, debit card associated with that account, and my credit card are all provided by discover, which is apparently uniquely hostile to its customers involvement in *any* crypto-related transaction, more so than, say, mastercard or visa.so, my brilliant solution to this issue was to use my discover debit card to buy two $500 prepaid vanilla visa cards. after several days researching the details of prepaid cards and online card payment processors, it appears that all cards that can be used for online transactions, including credit, debit, and prepaid cards, fall into one of two categories: authorized, meaning the card issuer has your identity info on file - whether or not they provide that info depends on the specifics of the transaction, but the important thing is that they *have* the info, and thus will confirm the card as authorized to whatever online card processor is handling the transaction. then there are the unauthorized cards, where the issuer will confirm the card is real, its balance is sufficient for the transaction, etc, but has no identity info on file associated with the card. and, unfortunately, it seems the vast majority of online payment processors will reject unauthorized cards.so my question is, besides losing 30% of the money trading these cards for btc on a p2p exchange with some dude in bulgaria, is there any way to either a) transfer/exchange the funds on these cards to another card, account, etc. that *can* be used to buy crypto, or b) find a direct coin vendor that will accept payment with such unauthorized cards?i will note that even the exchanges where i had completely the most extensive and detailed kyc processes (uploading &amp; verifying id cards, my passport, phone number, address, and so on) will not take these unauthorized cards, which seems strange to me as they already have all my identity info, so i cant see what the problem would be with paying with a card thats not associated with my identity. thanks in advance for any advice!

[removed] we've talked for years about ways to make crypto more mainstream.  i just realized that one of the best possible ways (other than amazon or walmart starting to accept crypto) would be via the gig economy.there are a lot of jobs that are done p2p globally through systems like amazon's mechanical turks (not an endorsement) or fivver (a site which i use regularly and endorse).  can you imagine if sites like this started to allow international payments in crypto?surely there is someone on r/cc that has some influence within an organization like this, who could put forward the idea to people high up.  i don't think amt has high potential, but fivver is pretty innovative, and surely if the people in fivver's c suite became aware of the advantages of implementing crypto within their system (because they would also save a lot of money), then the idea could gain some traction.i just thought of this based on a comment from this thread:[https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/comments/ifpti1/how\_would\_you\_recommend\_starting\_from\_0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/comments/ifpti1/how_would_you_recommend_starting_from_0/) [removed] hi guys,i have sent 2000 ubt from my metamask wallet with a fast transfer gas fee into the ubt deposit address of my bittrex wallet. the problem is, i see the deposit as pending in bittrex with 0/36 confirmations. it's been this way for 4 hours. if i copy the txid from bittrex and put it into etherscan i am greeted with a "sorry, we are unable to locate this txnhash". okay, i then went into my metamask wallet and clicked on the transaction. metamask says "transaction confirmed" with a tick and when i click the confirmed link (metamask) it instantly takes me to a page on etherscan.io saying "success". what's interesting to me is that the transaction hash is different to my txid on bittrex. is this supposed to be a different address from that of bittrex. is the transaction hash in metamask ether.io page supposed to match that of bittrex?thankyouneogasm [removed] [removed] hello, i am new to this subreddit and i don't know for sure if this is the right forum. i have stumbled upon multiple withdrawal emails from that specific website on an abandoned email account i have had for like 12 years and never closed. the emails simply state that a withdrawal has been made from my account on a periodical basis, but i have never even created an account on that website or on any other crypto related websites, as i have never been intereseted in cryptocurrency. i have sent several support requests to that website but no-one seems to answer, so i did some digging and found that the guy mentioned in the title has been involved in a bunch of shady crypto schemes and has had some on/off companies being created at the address ltcminer is registered.what's the next step i can do? as i don't want my email to be associated to any wallet used for who knows what. i live in another country than that company and i don't know if i can take any legal measures.please advise, kind redditors.&amp;#x200b;thanks in advance. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] hey guys, i would like to start a challenge where i start with literally $0, gain a few dollars (probably via airdrops) and start investing and reinvesting to compound profits and eventually reach hopefully interesting numbers. i want to show others you don't have to have a bank to turn a nice profit eventually. granted, i have 7+ years of experience in trading, but imo everyone can do the same if they're motivated and determined enough.what would you recommend? the first few dollars might be the hardest. bat browser? or is there any faster method to gain, let's say, $10? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i had the intention to invest in crypto (mostly bitcoin and/or ripple) to make a little bit of money. i dont want to become rich, just need some extra cash. i found crypto and it seemed pretty easy for a guy like me who doesn't know a lot about how the market works, also they give you a really cool card with cashback. it seemed almost perfect: card, cashback, 0% commissions. then i saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/comments/i2t327/stay_away_from_the_cryptocom_scam_they_cheated/). in the comments somebody said it was completely fair but i fail to understand.&amp;#x200b;would you mind explaining to me if [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) is good? if it's not, what do you suggest me to begin trading cryptocurrencies? i have read kraken is a good website but i wanted to go with only one platform instead of more than one. so, crypto or kraken?thank you!

[removed] i know they say dont leave money a exchange cus it can get hacked. but if you want to bid for cheapies, which exchange would you be most comfortable leaving your cash on for a year in hopes of getting filled cheapies some wallets use 24 word seed, some use 12 word.if 12 words is enough, why some use 24? will passionate support an open sourced version of keybase i think it is what is needed. i always thought computers were simple. at their fundamental level, they are just 1s and 0s. an invisible dance of yess and nos running through a sheet of silicon at billions of times per second. computers are amazing and unique machines that will forever be apart of our lives. our sheer dependence on computers motivated me to research the topic? as my understanding of this concept grew, so did my curiosity. i started researching computers as much as i could. i would spend hours a day browsing youtube and reading articles just to satisfy my interest. thats why when my dad first brought up the topic of bitcoin during my freshman year, i wasnt surprised to hear his enthusiasm. i had learned much about this currency over my couple years of research, but i knew very little about how to actually make money off it. he had been tracking the price for a few months and was considering buying a few, just to see what would happen. little did either of us know; the price of this virtual coin would multiply nearly 30 times in just a few short months.a few weeks passed and eventually he brought up the topic of buying bitcoin again. his initial interest inspired me to look more into currency and how it worked. i told my dad there was another way to make money off of bitcoins: bitcoin miners. these impressive and powerful computers are precisely optimized to earn these coins, and i knew i could make one. i explained how this was my once in a lifetime opportunity, like how he explained to me that he missed out on investing in apple in the 80s. it could be a money-printing machine, i joked. with our excitement peaked, we decided to split the $2,000 investment 50/50, and i started the buying process.i started the process by buying the parts of the machine. i had learned that like legos, a computer consists of simple components to make the whole. however, unlike an ordinary everyday computer, ours would have a concentrated task. mining bitcoin is not a complicated process for a computer to do. in essence, by completing simple math problems as quickly as possible, a computer process  bitcoin transactions from around the world and is rewarded in a tiny fraction of a coin. as more and more transactions take place, the higher the demand for processing, and the higher the reward.i was lucky enough to know how to build the computer. however, what i was not prepared for was the constant troubleshooting and maintenance i would have to give to this project. sometimes the computer would simply turn off randomly, sometimes a part was not detected, and other times it merely just ran at half its optimized rate. i learned how to fix issues where there was no logical reason for the problem. like a calculator, i always thought a computer could never mess up. my hundreds of hours of troubleshooting and blind hope quickly changed my view. i put a vast amount of free time into the project, knowing that potential it had. after lots of hard work, long nights, and determination, i had finally completed my dream project.i was proud of what i had created. the computer was placed in my room and was like a pet. the loud but rhythmic fans helped me fall asleep, and the heat kept me warm during the winter. from school, i would monitor the machine, and if it had run into an error, i would simply restart it from my phone. my plan was working, and in a little over half a year, our investment should turn into profit. in only a few months, we were already halfway to making our money back. we were lucky because the price of bitcoin itself had doubled since we started, going from nearly $10,000 to $20,000 in a few short months, but as i looked at my account, i had no bitcoin. a few days earlier, hackers had stolen $64 million dollars from the company i mined with.i felt like a victim. i had done everything right. i built the computer perfectly, i managed everything, i put the time in, and i put the effort in. i was robbed, and i was discouraged. forced with no other option, we restarted our operation. bitcoin was still increasing in price, we thought, so there was no reason to stop now. our operation had restarted and was going well, but for the first time since we started, the price of bitcoin was not doing so well. the bubble was about to burst. it began with my hack, which made national news and hurt the price. although the price recovered in a few weeks, it was going down again, fast. believing it would improve, my dad and i decided to hold and not sell. a month later, bitcoin was back to $8,000 per coin. the fad was over, and we couldnt even make a profit over our cost of electricity. again, i was robbed. i did nothing wrong and still lost almost everything. i decided to put the computer in a box and wait a few months; however, the wait was worthless. the coin plateaued at about $10,000, and it simply was not sustainable to continue mining. a year later, we sold the computers for parts and managed to make back about half our initial investment. it was over.i had lost over $1,000 and months of time and effort. however, as i moved on and started to reflect on the experience, i was the winner. i learned so much about computers and how they operate. in the end, i had learned many skills, from patience and compassion to planning and researching. i had learned not only to build a computer but to manage systems and multitask. i learned countless lessons and gained essential and unique skills that i hope will carry me throughout life. this unique experience has taught me to always keep trying at what i believe in. theres always an award for doing whatever i think is right. i hope to bring these beliefs and lessons with me throughout life, as i learn and grow from what i was taught. whenever people ask me what computers are, i always laugh and explain how a computer is just a bunch of simple lego bricks working together to do complicated tasks. however, inside i still have trouble answering this simple question. it is merely just parts working together, but a computer is so much more complicated and beautiful than that. honestly, i still dont understand them. this is a throwaway acc. im looking for a place to purchase an atleast week old reddit account with over 100 karma. will pay 2$ cashapp or bitcoin i'm sure that bitcoin will be an amazing way of storing value due to its properties. i simply don't see the need to implement the lighting network, why would you want to have a faster way to pay with bitcoin when something that you payed, for example, 10$ in 2013 is now worth about 1000$?i know that technology development is often something good, i'm not saying we shouldn't implement it, but aren't there just better fast payments methods like xrp or even usdt or dai?just few month ago i've started studying bitcoin so i'm new into this topic, i'd glad if someone can explain me why this is necessary. [removed] hiya,recently joined blockchain.com, bought 50s worth of btc which its put into a wallet i have called "btc trading wallet"but to send it to anyone i need to move it to "my bitcoin wallet"but when i try and send it across it says "your bitcoin transaction failed to send, please try again."i'm struggling to find any answers on the net and i'm seeing bad reviews when it comes to getting direct help from themanybody got any ideas? :)thanks for your help! [removed] * what mobile wallet do you use?* how many coins does it support?* is it open source?i'm thinking about using/building one, and curious what's popular i saw an article a few days ago about how some cryptocurrencies were trying to improve the speed and energy use by creating a different way to confirm transactions. i'm a beginner so all of this is over my head. i was hoping i could solicit some input from the experts.if any other currency is able to do so, wouldn't miners and any currency that doesn't adapt become more obsolete? from my understanding, mining is power and hardware intensive so if a currency was able to verify without needing to mine, wouldn't it force btc to adapt or become obsolete?i thought i caught a term, proof of work (pow) but i don't know if that's even applicable here.thanks in advance what is the best way to buy 1 million dollars worth of bitcoin and then sell it a couple years down the line? how would you go about doing so? you cant even buy 1 million worth of bitcoin on coinbase in a day. so, how to buy the 1 million in bitcoin. also, im guessing the best way to hold is in multiple ledger wallets. then, how would you sell? what exchange or website would you use to sell $1,000,000 worth of bitcoin? which is the best way to avoid big fees when dealing with this amount? i cant sell my physical gold instantly while im at home. with bitcoin i can do it from home... naked.i cant tell if my gold is real or fake, it could just be a tungsten bar from china. with bitcoin i dont need to worry about such trivial things. everything is open for me to verify without any third parties trust.i have no idea how much gold is really out there. with bitcoin i know exactly how much is being produced and how many exist.i cant send my gold anywhere in the world instantly. with bitcoin i can do it in the middle of the ocean from a satellite to someone anywhere on the globei cant sell a small portion of a gold coin instantly or pay for things easily. i would have to melt it in the crucibles to buy a taco from jack in the box.i cant mine gold in my shed out back. i can with bitcoin, if i had the funds.gold is for boomers.bitcoin destroys gold. let's say bitcoin moons and goes to the $1 million per bitcoin that we all hear about. obviously, the us economy would be in shambles, as if it's not already. how long would it take before bitcoiners will be vilified by the mainstream media and the calls to confiscate start? after all, they did it in 1933. the jackass in charge at the time whipped out his pen and took everyone's life savings and gave back some green toilet paper in return. he did this under threat of 10 years jail.the last thing i want to see is chris cuomo on cnn blaming me for all the problems in the us and calling for the government to force everyone to turn in their coins.will we have time to bail and head to st kitts? will other countries be offering citizenship? what about kyc? obviously, the irs knows which us citizens have purchased btc off of the major exchanges even if it is now in a hardware wallet. the irs can see the addresses in the hardware wallet that the coins are now sitting in and the exchange will have provided the source address for our accounts. i don't know what to do. [removed] [removed] why is bitcoin tanking? is it gonna go lower???? [removed] anti bitcoin arguments1. it's a ponzi scheme.2. tangibility argument - "but i can't hold it in my hand. i can hold gold in my hand."3. bitcoin could go to zero.4. volatility scary.5. i'm too lazy to read about bitcoin. it's too complex. i'm not interested.counterarguments:1. ponzi schemes have no underlying asset. bitcoin's asset is the highest money security ever invented. if you can call bitcoin a ponzi scheme, you can call any market traded asset a ponzi scheme.2. tangibility - the money in every banking and brokerage account isn't tangible either. but it spends just fine. you can hold gold in your hand, but you need a $15,000 machine to know if it's real or not. bitcoin requires as little as a smartphone, which 3.5 billion people own currently.3. bitcoin to zero? absurd. bitcoin's upside potential is literally infinite against every fiat currency. money printing always ensures bitcoin's success. stock to flow indicates that bitcoin is more likely to go to infinity than to zero.4. volatility is actually a plus with the right strategy. buy the dips. dca. never sell. short term volatility is acceptable when you plan on holding for years or generations. in 10 years, your kids won't care about a 50% dip that only lasted for 2 months.what did i leave out? please contribute. up until this summer, i could safely ignore defi as yet another fad by the perpetual crypto trend chasers. but then wrapped bitcoin (wbtc) became a collateral asset on compound and maker and tens of thousands of bitcoin worth hundreds of millions flooded into the market. i wanted to know more so i dabbled in the ethereum-base compound platform using some of my bitcoin.you can think of wbtc like gbtc (grayscale bitcoin trust), it's held by a trust called bitgo, and it carries similar risks and advantages. just as grayscale enables bitcoin to operate within traditional finance (traded on stock exchanges, held in 401k/ira accounts), wbtc enables bitcoin to operate in ethereum-base defi applications. while holding bitcoin in a centralized trust is not ideal, it is a short term solution to an immediate demand - just like gbtc. this is helping to boost demand for bitcoin and that's good for all bitcoiners, whether they like defi or not.the tremendous advantage i found with defi is the easy and relatively safe access to leverage backed and settled in real bitcoin. i used wbtc as collateral to borrow dollar-backed cryptos like usdc, tether, or dai. with the dollars i borrowed, i bought more bitcoin. since liquidation is a risk to over-leveraged users, i decided to play it safe- borrowing at rate of just 20% of my currently bitcoin holdings. compound and other defi apps reward you with their tokens for your participation in the network. you can then turn around and sell these tokens to buy more bitcoin.if you're like me, you're skeptical and you want to know if it's safe. the answer for me was that the benefits outweigh the risks. and even better, it's good for bitcoin. those bitcoiners who participate in defi by buying more bitcoin help redirect value from ethereum back to bitcoin, and the market is currently rewarding them handsomely for doing it. hello, i would like to sell my bitcoin and get payed out on my eu bank account.what is the best service with the lowest fees available?i'm using the exodus wallet.thank you! 1. open contracts of bitcoin options reached a record high. 2.cardano has completed shelley hard fork upgrade. 3. the director of the us monetary audit office said that the blockchain is superior to the payment system that the united states currently relies on banks.4. takeshi kimura, a senior official of the bank of japan, said that the digital yen is now the top priority of the central bank. 5. the digital cash of the cambodian central bank has been put into trial operation this month and is scheduled to be launched at the end of the third quarter. 6. the nigerian ministry of justice has submitted the bitcoin bill to the national assembly. 7. commentator justin wales said that the bitcoin network enjoys the protection of the first amendment i set the fee wayy to low not understanding what it even was, im using an electrum wallet and they give you the option to increase the fee when you right click on the transaction. though after putting my password in when i go to save the change it gives me the error message : "transaction could not be saved. it conflics with current history."

(whats ironic is that ares(aries) is the polar opposite to libra on the astrological wheel in position and definition.)    the ares cryptocurrency would follow that old base model, which centered around the private community. an ares crypto coin/blockchain -- backed by a working model that supports the belief that the planets influence human nature -- could be used within communities of people who have the position of mars in their birthchart outwardly indicated in some way.

[removed] [removed] [removed] so, what is algorand and why should you pay attention to it? let's break it down.algorand is a public crypto blockchain and protocol that aims to solve the "crypto trilemma". that means algorand fixes the problems other blockchains have with security, scalability, and decentralization. pretty much every other blockchain fails in one of those three categories. algorand doesn't.it operates on a pure proof of stake system, so gone are the days of high electricity usage. algorand's staking system is so simple all you need is 1 algo (the algorand token) in the algorand wallet (which is available for free on both android and iphone and is fantastic) to start staking. that's it. you'll earn algos proportional to how many you hold in your wallet ***every 20 minutes***. yeah, you heard that right. every 20 minutes your algorand wallet rewards you with new algos that are immediately compounded. it's the best thing since sliced bread. you'll be earning nearly **6%** per year just by holding your algos on your phone, it literally couldn't be easier.what else is awesome about algorand? flippin everything man. algorand has a transaction speed of 1000 transactions per second. that means you'll have your transaction *finalized* in under 5 seconds. so say good bye to the days of waiting for 30+ confirmations before your transaction goes through and several hours before you know if it's truly been finalized. this blows ethereum straight out of the water.furthermore, algorand transactions only cost .001 algo, that's like 0.0012 of a cent. really. i tried to use uniswap the other day, you know how much eth it charged me to make a single transaction? **$9 worth**. seriously. and then the transaction **didn't go through**. i mean, come on. ethereum's transaction fees are skyrocketing, vs algo's which will always remain the same because they've solved scalability issues blockchains like ethereum haven't.algorand has been designed by a team of geniuses, check out their team's profiles on the algorand website, they're practically all big shot computer scientists from mit and berkeley with tons of awards backing up their credibility. this isn't some slapped together team of romanian engineers fresh out of college, these guys are serious big fish with established careers, you literally can't find a more distinguished team behind a crypto today. if anything, you should invest in the team behind algorand, they're absolute powerhouses.algorand has a venture capital firm working to promote its spread and adoption. that's big money spending money to make more money. which means you don't have to, all you have to do is hop on board the gravy train to flavor town. speaking of hopping on board, algorand is now on coinbase as of july of this year and you know getting on coinbase means your coin is at the entrance to the cryptocurrency world for most new us traders, that fact alone gives a huge boost to algorand going up.algorand launched on june 19th, 2019. since then it's jumped to the 37th highest market cap in the crypto world. seriously, in just a year and two months algorand has gained a market cap of **$430 million**. if that doesn't tell you the train is chugging full steam ahead i don't know what will.algo is still cheap. right now it's at 55 cents per algo, that's chump change compared to what it'll be worth in a year or two, and the gains are just going to keep coming as algorand just released (6 days ago) new features that help a ton with defi apps. these new features include stateful smart contracts that increase efficiency by storing certain information in user accounts rather than in the code. and algorand now allows private rekeying, meaning you can now change the custody of wallets easily, a feature no one else has and one that will have massive positive implications for defi. algorand is set up to become the leading blockchain in the defi space by providing huge improvements for developers over ethereum.get ready for salty bears to claim algorand has already failed because their ico price was $2.88 and then it dropped, that just means it's time to buy in ya dinguses. only true brainiacs use that flawless argument. logic? ferget about it!tldr: there's so many benefits to algorand it's ridiculous. i only listed like half of them! it's the strongest competitor for ethereum in the crypto space today and will ultimately eat a huge chunk of eth's market share based on pure advantages over eth, so get on board now before you miss out.and be sure to use the algorand wallet and get those sweet, sweet staking rewards. let your money make you money.

[removed] [removed] i've been thinking about 24-hour volume, and i believe that it's double the actual volume.why?  because the exchanges, to encourage the appearance of higher volumes, are probably double-counting everything.example:  someone was sitting on the sidelines for a few weeks, eth has dipped from $440 to $389, and they decide to sell some tether to go back into eth.  they sell $1000 in usdt and buy $1000 in eth.  my theory is that the exchange says that the eth trading volume has just increased by $1000 and the usdt trading volume has just increased by $1000.  for every sell, there is a buy, therefore, everything is getting counted on both the buy side and the sell side.not that i truly care about this, it's just an observation with a half-raised eyebrow.  tricky bastards.does anyone have information or speculation to the contrary? [removed] when people start to think and learn about cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, it is helpful to think about it in terms of a symbiotic relationship.protocols like bitcoin and ethereum could not exist without human inputs like code, computers, the internet, and energy.humanity, on the other hand, is just beginning to learn what protocols like bitcoin and ether can do to assist and ensure our survival and advancement as a species.right now, because of their fundamental breakthroughs in data security and accounting, it appears that cryptocurrencies can help us in our quest to optimize human consumption, coordination, collaboration, and competition to create a more sustainable human community.humans will need to nurture this man-computer symbiosis and create a long-term co-dependence that ensures our survival as a species.

which ones? how many bitcoin in each? so i just got into bitcoin a couple of days ago. i bought some on two different sites/apps. do i need to get a wallet now? if so why and which wallet? i'm really new to this. i def should've done more research. bitcoin is a money market defined by a constantly changing number of buyers and sellers.  these market participants have different bitcoin strategies with different time horizons, and each participant has limited knowledge about the rest of the participants in the bitcoin ecosystem.on the buy side - you have your one-time buy and holders, sat-stackers, day-traders, technologists, remittance payments, institutional traders, gamblers, gamers, etc... the list goes on and on... all of these buyers use bitcoin for different reasons.this demand pressure is constantly interacting with sell pressure...on the sell side - you have people who want to cash out for any number of reasons: maybe a long-time holder is selling back to fiat for a personal or financial reason, maybe a family who received a remittance payment in bitcoin needs to convert bitcoin to their local currency, maybe someone is selling to pay taxes, daytraders are sellers toothis incomplete knowledge of other people's motives is the essence of the invisible hand, and this is why bitcoin is a perfect kind of money as it uses a market clearinghouse system to constantly find equilibrium and reconcile the differing time horizons of every actor into the current price of entering into the system. question regarding the viability of bitcoin in the long term.  from my understanding, the security of bitcoin comes from miners who verify the blockchain.  what happens when there is so much halving that the reward for mining bitcoin is extremely low and the cost of verifying the blockchain for the miners exceeds the reward of their bitcoin? i have seen quite a lot post about btc and cryptocurrencies. what about coinbase rewards. i have been researching and i have found out the coinbase grants cryptocurrency rewards ( not just btc but  other crypto) for free for competing surveys.  for those of you who use the platform how legit is it?

sha512its now been over 48 hours of the market being down. the market mod panel has also been down that long. i had hoped it would have returned by now. it is looking very unlikely that it will. the mod panel is down and the admins are not on jabber.i don't think the admins ever planned an exit, planned exits usually disable withdrawals and continue accepting deposits for weeks sometimes even much longer. it was only a week ago when btc on the market temporarily stopped working and the admins fixed it fast allowing btc withdrawals again. if it was a planned exit i don't think they would have put in any work fixing btc withdrawals that close to the end. they had frequently told me they wanted empire to be the longest living market in history and for the most part i do think that was their intentions and is why the market was online for as long as it was. having said that. it is sad the admins didn't give any notice of the closure and there is no excuse for that.i know the admins were getting tired of keeping empire market running. the market was on auto-pilot for the last half a year with no new features being added. i had made suggestions, some of the suggestions was getting rid of pins and only using pgp 2fa or reviewing xmr code to make xmr withdrawals more reliable. most of my suggestions were ignored. earlier on in the history of the market they listened to me more. the market launched with allowing weapon purchases, they removed it after i strongly advocated against the market having anything to do with weapons. in the last half a year it wasn't just ignored suggestions. communication in general between the mod team and the admins was very limited. this was frustrating but i had accepted that this is the way they wanted it.here is why i think the admins closed shop.empire market started having good uptime again after the endgame links were added 4 months ago. the market was online because the two admins agreed to make weekly payments to [/u/schwerergustav](http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/u/schwerergustav) to keep the market online. gustav had been holding down the market brutally for a long time and when the endgame links were added, he took all those down too. that was probably the closest the market came to a breaking point and a deal was made. i wasn't told of the specific details of the arrangement and i never spoke directly to gustav but i can guess he must have been getting paid at least $10k or $15k a week maybe more.the market was already in a complicated spot with gustav and when new ddos came from a new ddoser that could hold down 9 endgame links. this was probably when the admins decided to call it quits. i doubt they would want to pay multiple ddosers and at the same time it wouldn't work paying one ddoser if another is holding the market down.having said all of that, if the tor staff team had fixed the problems in tor that makes an attack like this possible, i believe the admins would have stuck around longer. tor staff know what they need to do to fix this and that is to add pow to the network. maybe they are working on this now and its nice to see they are talking about pow more frequently but they have been stalling on this for years. i'll go one step further and say if tor staff team added pow years ago even dream market might still be here.i never had server access to the market but i did host the new forum. the forum was spared from the start date of the new ddos but after the admins took the market down completely, even the mod panel. the forum started getting attacked after that. it was up and down for the day after the market was taken down then i took the forum down, waiting for the market or mod panel to return. in my point of view, putting in the cost and time to fight the ddos and keep the forum online was a thankless task if the admins have stopped communicating with me and stopped paying me. this is why the forum was online for a short time after the market was taken down but was taken down later. they were not hosted together. i started at empire as a volunteer forum moderator on the old forum and never thought i would come this far. this is a sour conclusion but i am proud of the work i put in.i'm disappointed the admins ended the market like this. i apologize to anyone that had money in escrow. i can only advise that you use markets with multisig and only use that for big orders.much love. se7en.\-----begin pgp

[removed] i was wondering, while bitcoin is a whole different asset-class, why we so desperately want etfs to contain it, well yes, it is great that you can put your 401k in to grayscale etf, but overall on stock market, purpose of etf quite different, it is used for reasons such as:1. diversification2. self-sufficient asset(no action needed in case you've got your dividend &amp; etcetera)3. buying something you wouldn't be able otherwise(such as chinesse / japanesse stocks)and where there is always indirect ownership of the stock as well as stocks in etfs too, we just castrate bitcoins biggest advantage on the market, you can not trade stocks and own them directly, so there is brokerage service, but putting bitcoin on that field means willingly castrate btc.bottom line here is:1. indirect ownership, all the advantage erased2. you simply can not rebalance bitcoin's share inside particular portfolio with etf3. you are paying fees to the fund and the exchange market although unlike with shares there is no changes in depository because in bitcoin's case it is - blockchain4. we need some kind of new type of market inbetween stock exchange and crypto exchange, until that, all these bitcoin contained etfs are like modern sports cars being moved by donkey. is the crypto.com wallet app an actual wallet for bitcoin? slow and steady wins the race. his go fund me page, and all the knock off go fund me type websites have been shut down.  is there a reputable source that wont scam people out of bitcoin, that can make a fund in his name? when you find those purples gems ;) is it possible to create a trustless and permissionless marketplace based on bitcoin (or other) blockchain? guys, could you recommend the best wallet for crypto (btc, eth, usdt) like blockchain.com? [removed] can anyone here who understands bitcoin underlying tech tell me if there is a way to time lock your bitcoin to a specific date in the future? hello so whenever i open trading view chart it opens on the hourly candles and i was wondering how to make the daily chart or any other the default ones, it is really a pain in the ass to have to change the candle type everytime i open the app on twitter, samourai wallet seems to think that an executive order 6102 will happen to bitcoin in the future.  "without privacy your digital gold can and will be 6102'd" - samourai.surely unless everyone has great privacy by doing coinjoins, using a full node, buys non kyc btc, then seeing as likely &lt;5% of bitcoin owners do those things, govts seizing 95% of people's btc will harm adoption and make btc practically obsolete. better than stocks or options trading by a margin, trade crypto! our ai-driven swing trader is ahead of this bear market by a margin! watch on your favorite streaming app..  .https://youtu.be/mczltvcwqs8 https://dlive.tv/coindex_labs https://www.twitch.tv/coindex_labs &amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/zd9juuwt6jj51.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8ecddbd8a44b34c5c0487da279d024a00cae8f8 [removed] better than stocks or options trading by a margin, trade crypto! our ai-driven swing trader is ahead of this bear market by a margin! watch on your favorite streaming app..  .https://youtu.be/mczltvcwqs8 https://dlive.tv/coindex_labs https://www.twitch.tv/coindex_labs what is the best broker or trading platform for signing up as a (european) company?i am looking for low fees and possibly the easiest regstration process available. [removed] hi all,while doing some research about you know who, strangely enough not satoshi, i found this interesting paper [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3065723] published by a nancy nakamoto.why is this interesting?well it's "nancy nakamoto" the female pseudonymous entity equivalent to satoshi.  say what???and because it's talking about "centralising" bitcoin and also specifically mentioning that will not be segwit or bitcoin cash and then goes on to talk about relational data models.   i find this interesting as this sounds suspiciously like craig wright as his current diatribe for bitcoin.  note the british english spelling of "centralised".  then there's that savings of "99.9999999947853%" :p"nancy" kindly supplies her email address and i have a feeling that the replies received from this address might be somewhat incredulous.i could of course be wrong about the craig wright connection.thoughts please.

choose those asics for which you can get spare parts as soon as possible. in this way you will avoid serious pauses in the mining process and loss of income.in addition, the following two factors should be considered:* asics have practically no interchangeable parts. however, fans are an exception, but it all depends on their size. for example, bitmain's asics have fans of the same size, while the innosilicon's fans are larger. the control boards of bitmain asics of the 17 series are also interchangeable.* the most popular manufacturer is bitmain.1. the cost of asicif you are going to purchase a large number of devices, their price may be the most influential factor.be sure to compare prices of different suppliers. some of them may increase price on purpose, so that you may overpay. but by checking the offers of other suppliers, you will avoid this situation.also, do not purchase new asics immediately after their release. wait a little  over time, their price will drop slightly, and you will also have the opportunity to read reviews and decide if these devices are worth your investment.it is also worth finding out how much electricity asic consumes per terahash. for example, some devices require 1.6 kw of power, while others consume 6 kw. in the end, an asic which consumes 6 kw of energy will cost much more, because you will spend a substantial part of your profit on paying electricity bills.1. the devices warrantywarranty terms are another factor worth paying attention to:* what is the warranty period of your potential asic? obviously, the longer the warranty is valid, the better and easier it is for you.* is there a warranty service center nearby (in your city or at least country)? if it is missing, look for a post-warranty center  sometimes it's easier to choose this one, even if the device is still under warranty. why? the fact is that sometimes warranty repairs can take a very long time, which means loss of profit for you.* what specific cases does the warranty not cover?# the most efficient asic models in 2020### bitmain antminer s19 prohttps://preview.redd.it/z8wbf9lkthj51.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b4b125e540e0ee72c9975bd0fe66326426623c8* impressive power  hashrate up to 110 th/s;* high stability thanks to the new apw12 power supply;* effective energy saving  up to 29.5 j/th;* bitmain fans are interchangeable.### bitmain antminer 17 (old generations)https://preview.redd.it/5wldxnplthj51.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09d315fd75b47ac1b72f1d1e3e9bc1139c92df4d* easy to overclock;* considered to be one of the most durable asics;* bitmain fans are interchangeable;* bitmain 17 series control boards are also interchangeable;* the device is compatible with the hiveon asic firmware (using it, you can mine profitably and achieve a hashrate of 56 th/s on a standard power supply unit).### bitmain antminer s17 prohttps://preview.redd.it/7k8w1eqmthj51.png?width=1115&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ef0effd364fad79a22939f8970c812f59bbf5ca* reliability and durability;* the asic is easy to overclock;* bitmain fans are interchangeable;* the device is compatible with the hiveon asic firmware (using it, you can achieve a hashrate of 80.1 th/s on a standard power supply unit).### innosilicon t3https://preview.redd.it/r5mp8cgnthj51.jpg?width=962&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eee36966888be6c731ce9a78459ce6c19dec97c* high reliability;* asic boost enabled;* asic is equipped with an improved cooling system;* the device allows you to achieve a hashrate of 43 th/s.### whatsminer m20shttps://preview.redd.it/1yhieb8othj51.jpg?width=2400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48b6a191cfddb7bfda80f938305cabc03b9df036* reliability and efficiency;* the device allows you to achieve a hashrate of 68 th/s.it is likely that in the near future asics will replace gpu rigs even more. this means that the issue of choosing new profitable devices should be addressed right now. i need bitcoin to hit 1 million asap so i can tell my wife i told you so. nothing will satisfy me more. [removed] if we're about to see another hype cycle, bitcoin will start having macro-economic effects. other economic sectors will be hurt (as if covid19 wasn't enough), and they might send their lobbyists to influence politicians and start a smear campaign against the bitcoin community.if you live in a democratic country, the best way to tackle this is to join one of the big established political parties. the politicians must know that if they yield to the anti-bitcoin lobbyists, they will lose votes both in the general elections and in internal votings inside the party.i know you may feel disgusted to join a political party that you disagree with so many of its actions, but you don't even have to vote for it in the general elections. just have your voice inside. creating new political parties is mostly pointless - nobody will vote for a bitcoin party any time soon...most people here probably lean towards right wing parties, but i can see why some people will want to join left parties for other reasons (what's the point of a setting a minimum wage if the money itself is being debased? also, the cantillon effect and inflation are the least progressive taxes).when some politicians will start to go after bitcoin, sitting at home and writing angry reddit posts won't be enough. if bitcoin grows, it will become a political issue, and we have to be ready. who wants to get invested into the bitcoin and gets daily profit its secure and safe, with much referral bonuses [removed] i know.. i am still a hodl!but .....move it to cash app, use the debit card, it's like normal.i have some coin a bought a while back. just took some profit for the wife.can move small amounts of money, like a checking account.fee's aint bad. bitcoin has had 2 bugs where someone could mint as many free bitcoin as  they wanted. one bug was exploited and the other was caught in time.could you tell me  please  how  those  bug  were  exploited? i mean in the code. since bitcoin is written in c and is immutable code... how  the heck  could  the hacker  play  with the code  and  exploit the bitcoin network? i mean:  there  is  no interface  to play  with some  attack. at the best there  is the  bitcoin clientmy  question is: techniclly where  the hacker put his  fancy code in order to mint more  bitcoin than usual? which  interface  was exploited / the  hacker played  with in order to  do that?

can it handle being adopted on a global scale by millions, or even billions of people? if not, what are the solutions to this (i've heard of lightning, and see it being criticised a lot. feel free to highlight why this is or isn't a good solution).2. centralisation: i'm aware that most of the mining farms (is that even the right term?) are in china. is this a big problem? why, or why not? let's say in a hypothetical situation where these were forcibly shut down, what would that mean for bitcoin?for the record, i don't have a great understanding of the more technical side of crypto. in fact that's why i chose my username as crypto grandma. so, forgive my questions if they are naive or ill informed. i appreciate anyone who can elig (explain like i'm your grandma) why these concerns (and any others that may be relevant) are or are not important, and what the potential solutions can be. thanks!

[removed] [removed] how ?if you look at it from the perspective "what is a max possible net worth today for a private person"let's calculate:jeff bezos net worth = 200b $winkelvoss brothers own 1% of all btc = 2b $ todayif bitcoin = 1m $ than winkelvoss net worth = 200b $ equals jeff bezosso no big deal... it seems like recently there are new rules for bitcoin . i noticed binance for example wont let you sign up with the app in the usa .also local bitcoin. com wont let anything work in ohio . clearly our corrupted political class has been bought off by the bankers just like they have been for anything else that will pay them .how do you sell bitcoins in ohio / usa ? hey all, just saw a video about primexbt.com and it seems pretty good, but on google i got an ad saying it was a possible scam?any experience to share guys? the ongoing 'war' against privacy coins has threatened the future of privacy coins and sending a message. if people want privacy, why don't they just use the privacy tools made for the good old bitcoin and be free? there are many mixers (bitcoinmix and others) around to help with that.anyways, do you think an increased use of privacy feature on bitcoin will also threaten bitcoin? so we keep hearing from pundits and hardcore bitcoiners that because the supply is finite, its a scarce asset and that is one of the principles of sound money. but the fact that you need to custody your coins, the fact that over time, some btc will be lost due to many reasons.....can we really think that bitcoin will become a currency? for example, if i have 4 kids and i give them my btc equally and they each have 3 kids who get their shares equally, there is a chance that 1/12 of those eventual inheriters will forget their seed phrase, and end up losing their btc into the ether.\- even with fiat, the fed recycles old dollars (good luck finding the old $20 bills anymore)\-besides the qe and unlimited printing, the fed also literally puts fresh notes into circulation\-if i lose or bury my notes or gold somewhere, someone will eventually find it, so its not really lost. the some cannot be said about bitcoin....if you forget your seed, that btc is gone.i want to get some thoughts for the distant future and how do you see bitcoin functioning as a currency if ultimately it will keep losing supply? [removed] i started buying btc ( which i never sold afterwards) in 2016, and have been holding *only* btc since then. i continue to hold it, and even buy it, even though today my so called btc stash is 20x its original price.here is my opinion about btc's expected price action in next 2-3 years* first point, there will be no parabola like late 2017, where btc price went 4x in about 4 months. 4x price action in such short range, will not happen, because there are many exchanges like bakkt and cme, which allow shorting of btc. which means that price action will not be drastic.* the upward movement in price will continue for next 2-3 yeras, and beyond. overall, i expect it to be at 18k at eoy, and at about 25k-40k at end of 2021.* the price rise is happening due to demand from gbtc ( normal 401-k holders), and demand from recent buyer like microstrategy , which is a mnc that bought staggering 22k btc. that 22k btc, btw, took price from 9k to 11k. so here you can see demand directly taking price higher. i keep a tight watch on gbtc, and its accumulating btc at a drastic pace, spurred by demand from normal fellows mostly who are buying it for their 401-k. on top of that, get this, gbtc has **no redemption program**. which means it only buys btc, ( and sells it only for fees if any).* and now fidelity is coming with its own bitcoin fund ( and only bitcoin). that shows the demand for bitcoin from the investors at large.* governments have already realized they cannot stop btc. trump had told mnuchin in 2018 to "go after btc'. but mnuchin could not do anything, because there is not much he can do. so on that front, bitcoin has proven ( to the extent) its strength as decentralized network which can't be brought down easily be governments. that's why microstrategy bought it too - they aren't fools to put so much money in something mnuchin could bring down overnight by a decree. so there will be no such decree. at some point, govt's will likely enforce control ( using tax as reason, for example), and it will reduce bitcoin's attractiveness, but its hard to look that far into future, because as of now, that is not what's happening.* another bullish point is absolute lack of any alternative to btc. the top 10, apart from btc, is a shitshow. xrp is an out and out scam. and even others are totally no shots and scams. so bitcoin is the only thing in this market.* i think anyone who buys btc today, and holds for next 10 years, can get returns of about 10x-15x. and the thing is, the risk is very low, so i strongly recommend people to buy at least 10-20% of their portfolio in btc. this is for everyone. i myself am about 80% into btc.* finally, don't buy btc if you can't stand falls as much as 75% ( in few months), and **more**. this is speculative asset. the base price is defined by long term holders, but the daily market price is defined by traders, who will sell all btc they hold ( even as people like me will not do that). so the price can flucuate, and i recommend you only buy if you can hold it for minimum 4 years. instead tesla gets subsidized. irs tax laws make it risky to plan your life with bitcoin, when it should be encouraged in a supposedly free country.our countrys politicians keep promising the people a better life, but it never comes to be.bitcoin comes along and solves a whole host of problems, and governments view it as a threat and call it a fraud.but tesla gets subsidized to go explore the solar system.but we wont give people the tools they need on earth to live peacefully with one another??makes no sense. hey, so i just recieved btc on cashapp and was trying to figure out how to get it into my bank account, clicked withdraw and copied my current addy and clicked sent. it just says pending now and i didnt get an email from cashapp... did i just screw myself? bitcoin hasnt hit that of course we accept bitcoin level in the economy and it never will if it continues to be taxed in this way.capital gains taxes and the irs demanding tax payment in usd are the achilles heel of bitcoin.but bitcoin is a completely new thing. it should not be taxed like simple property or a collectible.if you want to see an explosion of sustainable economic growth in the economy, then the taxation of bitcoin must be reformed.they can even charge the capital gains if i trade my bitcoin for usd for all they want. but if im trying to buy my groceries or a house with bitcoin, then the capital gains tax need not apply.... or can be greatly reduced. [removed] inspired by [this tweet from planb](https://twitter.com/100trillionusd/status/1298939133369483264) regarding the recent announcment that microstrategy is allocating 50% of their holdings to btc.&gt; this is a game changer: nasdaq listed company with $250m bitcoin (25% of assets, 15% of market cap) is basically a bitcoin etf!&gt;&gt; shareholders have 15% btc exposure and 85% tech. no capital charges (like banks &amp; pension funds), no sec approval needed (like etf)&gt; yes, if you buy a share, you have a share of that 21,500 btc (0.1% of all bitcoins that will ever exist!). and if that 21,500 btc will rise in value, say if btc goes from current $11k to $100k or $288k ..so my question is, is purchasing microstrategy stock within a 401k/ira a good way to get exposure to btc in my retirement account? i'm not expecting to become a millionaire in a month, but is even 1k in profit possible with bitcoin, say over 6 months?how do i get started? total noobie here!thank you! [removed] [removed] [removed] what is satoshi some day just cashed out all his original wallets. would that be possible? [removed] https://twitter.com/peterschiff/status/1299028565250502656?s=20 soon after satoshi made his big announcement more than a decade ago, a lot of concerns emerged pointing towards a crucial problem on his solution: scalability.  particularly since mt. gox, a lot started to change for bitcoin. out in the open, a multitude of crypto exchanges started popping up making bitcoin and other coins easily accessible to pretty much anyone. nevertheless, the original concerns on satoshis proposal remained. in parallel and away from the spotlight, a group of passionate developers started crafting the solution to bitcoins scalability problem. today the solution is here and its name is the lightning network.currently, users can access for free a wide range of bitcoin lightning wallets. nevertheless, instant bitcoin payments are still far from mainstream. most of these wallets are extremely hard to use and as such are only catered to the most experienced of users. despite that, the future of lightning looks bright. as of today, there are over 11k lightning nodes out there and this number is steadily growing. lightnings case of becoming the solution to bitcoins woes looks strong.holding that as a north star, we started building a solution to combine hardware level security with lightning to enable instant bitcoin to fiat transactions on hardware at a pos through debit card emulation.this project was overly ambitious and we quickly realized not enough people cared enough about hardware level security for payments. but the ground we covered was not in vain. during the process of building our hardware solution and talking to our beta users we came across a powerful discovery: enabling small and instant bitcoin payments with zero fees to mainstream users via lightning could be the way to finally make bitcoin a widely and globally used means of payment.during the last few years, weve seen titans, such as coinbase and binance, emerge. undeniably, these projects have helped bitcoin tremendously by raising awareness and making onboarding to the cryptocurrency easy and intuitive globally. nevertheless, an equivalent figure to position bitcoin as a globally usable currency via lightning is yet to come.with this in mind, we built an interoperable payments layer between bitcoin (lightning &amp; on-chain) and euros (to start with), using payment instruments familiar to mainstream consumers, namely ibans and debit cards. this means, users can move between bitcoin and euros in either direction, with a single interface.this will allow users to:\-(i) send and receive bitcoin payments both form and to lightning wallets and bitcoin on-chain wallets;\-(ii) send and receive euro payments both from and to ibans and debit cards;\-(iii) make bitcoin payments, both lightning and on-chain, directly from euro denominated ibans and/or a debit cards; and\-(iv)top-up euro denominated debit cards directly with bitcoin.all of this was carefully built in response to what we heard from the community and as we mention[ throughout our story](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/comments/aeeipa/). weve dedicated the last few years of our lives and the foreseeable future to make this happen and we simply want to[ make it possible for more people to do things with bitcoin.](https://lastbit.io/)**tldr**:[ lastbit](https://lastbit.io/) is putting out a beta application that contains a single interface to bitcoin, lightning, euros and debit cards. this app will allow users to move between these payment instruments in any direction they like. get paid in euros from a lightning invoice? sure. pay euros to a lightning invoice? sure. swipe a debit card and pay for your purchase with a lightning invoice? sure. and more. https://www.cityam.com/bitcoin-is-a-game-of-musical-chairs-and-the-music-is-stopping/ i was recently sent some tbtc for testing by my friend on telegram, but the transaction has been now pending for hours and it remains unconfirmed.this is the address which has unconfirmed tbtc transactions (2 of them ) : [https://tbtc.bitaps.com/2mzmxdsvegkgoqj8sfa3crszeeedhqxvogs](https://tbtc.bitaps.com/2mzmxdsvegkgoqj8sfa3crszeeedhqxvogs)i think he kept the fees to be very low but i have no idea what is appropriate fees in testnet. i also think it would be great if there was a way i could pay to speed up this transaction if possible. or there could be more possibilities i'm not aware of - any ideas?

choose the device that consumes the minimum. otherwise, you will have to spend most of your income on paying your electricity bills.* what overclocking profiles are available and how much power does the asic need to reach them? choose the model that will allow you to achieve the maximum hashrate, while consuming as little as possible.* how easy is it to get spare parts for an asic and have it repaired in your city? choose a device that can be put back in line as quickly as possible, as prolonged repairs mean equipment downtime and loss of profit.pay attention to the following models:* bitmain antminer s19 pro (hashrate up to 110 th/s and energy saving up to 29,5 j/th);* bitmain antminer s17 pro (easy to overclock, high reliability);* old generations of bitmain antminer 17 (easy to overclock, high durability);* innosilicon t3 (an improved cooling system).# take care of ventilation and coolingasics consume a lot of energy, and almost all of it is converted into heat. if devices overheat, their chips will suffer, which will negatively affect hashrate and your income. accordingly, in order to mine bitcoin profitably and without downtime, you need to take care of ventilation and cooling.* clean your devices from dust regularly  clean asics are less likely to overheat.* make sure that the room is ventilated enough  if possible, open windows and doors, and install fans, directing them so that the airflow will remove the heat generated by the asics from the room.* do not install devices too close to each other. leave some space between them for better ventilation.* try immersion cooling (immersing devices in a container of dielectric fluid). using this method, you can eliminate the purchase of air conditioners and cut costs.# join the [pool](https://hiveon.net/)by mining bitcoin on a pool, not individually, you will receive payments more often, which means that your income will be much more stable. when choosing a pool, consider the following factors:* payout model (the most profitable option is pps+, which means that you will receive a payment for each share that you submit);* pool fee;* transaction fees;* proximity of servers (the closer the server is, the more stable the mining process and, accordingly, your income are).# install custom hiveon asic firmwareat the moment, profitable bitcoin mining is almost impossible without custom firmware, and [hiveon asic](https://hiveos.farm/asic) is the best available option:* using the downvolting function, you can reduce your energy consumption and cut costs on paying electricity bills. for example, on the stock firmware asic antminer s17e consumes 2700 kw, while the hashrate is 60 th/s. with the hiveon asic firmware, the device consumes much less power (1314 kw), and the hashrate remains at the same level.* thanks to the overclocking function, you will be able to achieve a higher hashrate and increase your income.* the temperature watchdog reboots the asic or stops the mining process if it reaches a critical point, so your devices don't overheat.* you can also set up the desired temperature of the chips. the temperature will be maintained automatically, which will positively affect their performance.* the hashrate watchdog reboots the device if the hashrate drops below normal. this will help you to avoid loss of profit.* the autotuning function adjusts the frequencies of the chips to increase the hashrate and maintain the level of power consumption. this is especially useful for chips that are already worn out  they will last longer and still be nearly as effective as full-fledged working chips.* thanks to the built-in wattmeter, you will always be aware of how much electricity your asics consume.* with the hiveon asic firmware, you can use the [hive os](https://hiveos.farm/) monitoring and management system for free. in this way, you will cut your costs and be able to manage thousands of devices at the same time.as you can see, profitable bitcoin mining is still possible even in 2020. to do this, you need to responsibly approach the matter of choosing equipment, provide devices with ventilation and cooling, join the pool and improve the devices with custom firmware.

[removed] [removed] altcoins are appealing because they offer a wide variety of technical solutions for potential real world problems, but trading bitcoin pairs into altcoins is a parasitic behavior that will keep bitcoin suppressed below all time highs indefinitely. as it turns out, altcoin traders, not whales, are the single biggest source of sell pressure on bitcoin. not only that, on most exchanges significant amounts of money are lost out of the total crypto marketcap everytime you swap coin for coin. exchanges love altcoins because it's a very lucrative business to parasitically steal off of crypto's marketcap every transaction.in order for crypto to achieve new highs, alt season must end.

choose the device that consumes the minimum. otherwise, you will have to spend most of your income on paying your electricity bills.* what overclocking profiles are available and how much power does the asic need to reach them? choose the model that will allow you to achieve the maximum hashrate, while consuming as little as possible.* how easy is it to get spare parts for an asic and have it repaired in your city? choose a device that can be put back in line as quickly as possible, as prolonged repairs mean equipment downtime and loss of profit.pay attention to the following models:* bitmain antminer s19 pro (hashrate up to 110 th/s and energy saving up to 29,5 j/th);* bitmain antminer s17 pro (easy to overclock, high reliability);* old generations of bitmain antminer 17 (easy to overclock, high durability);* innosilicon t3 (an improved cooling system).# take care of ventilation and coolingasics consume a lot of energy, and almost all of it is converted into heat. if devices overheat, their chips will suffer, which will negatively affect hashrate and your income. accordingly, in order to mine bitcoin profitably and without downtime, you need to take care of ventilation and cooling.* clean your devices from dust regularly  clean asics are less likely to overheat.* make sure that the room is ventilated enough  if possible, open windows and doors, and install fans, directing them so that the airflow will remove the heat generated by the asics from the room.* do not install devices too close to each other. leave some space between them for better ventilation.* try immersion cooling (immersing devices in a container of dielectric fluid). using this method, you can eliminate the purchase of air conditioners and cut costs.# join the [pool](https://hiveon.net/)by mining bitcoin on a pool, not individually, you will receive payments more often, which means that your income will be much more stable. when choosing a pool, consider the following factors:* payout model (the most profitable option is pps+, which means that you will receive a payment for each share that you submit);* pool fee;* transaction fees;* proximity of servers (the closer the server is, the more stable the mining process and, accordingly, your income are).# install custom hiveon asic firmwareat the moment, profitable bitcoin mining is almost impossible without custom firmware, and [hiveon asic](https://hiveos.farm/asic) is the best available option:* using the downvolting function, you can reduce your energy consumption and cut costs on paying electricity bills. for example, on the stock firmware asic antminer s17e consumes 2700 kw, while the hashrate is 60 th/s. with the hiveon asic firmware, the device consumes much less power (1314 kw), and the hashrate remains at the same level.* thanks to the overclocking function, you will be able to achieve a higher hashrate and increase your income.* the temperature watchdog reboots the asic or stops the mining process if it reaches a critical point, so your devices don't overheat.* you can also set up the desired temperature of the chips. the temperature will be maintained automatically, which will positively affect their performance.* the hashrate watchdog reboots the device if the hashrate drops below normal. this will help you to avoid loss of profit.* the autotuning function adjusts the frequencies of the chips to increase the hashrate and maintain the level of power consumption. this is especially useful for chips that are already worn out  they will last longer and still be nearly as effective as full-fledged working chips.* thanks to the built-in wattmeter, you will always be aware of how much electricity your asics consume.* with the hiveon asic firmware, you can use the [hive os](https://hiveos.farm/) monitoring and management system for free. in this way, you will cut your costs and be able to manage thousands of devices at the same time.as you can see, profitable bitcoin mining is still possible even in 2020. to do this, you need to responsibly approach the matter of choosing equipment, provide devices with ventilation and cooling, join the pool and improve the devices with custom firmware.

[removed] [removed] [removed] if you look at the facts because  bitcoin is doing poorly first of all if you look at your tax returns in 2020 you notice that on the first page you see a question about cryptocurrency because they're starting to tax bitcoin on top of that bitcoin proven time and time again to be unreliable because goes up and down so much so it is not stable another reason why is because bitcoin is also very expensive when compared to other cryptocurrencies which has much higher potential than bitcoin itself because bitcoins are a  established making it one of the worst cryptocurrencies to invest in and on top of that bitcoin will probably be outlawed and then it'll get replaced by world government cryptocurrency such as crypto dollar, crypto euro and on top of that bitcoin is so easy to be hacked  many bitcoin firms have been hacked and and bitcoin has very bad privacy on compared to other cryptocurrencies such as zcash and bitcoin and bitcoin that has no intrinsic value also you need the internet to access it meaning if the dollar collapses it won't be a much use because the internet probably collapsed if if all world's currencies collapse which is even right now very unlikely well the dollar might collapse it isn't going to create a currency reset for the rest of the world and i consider that's a big coin is it's been decreasing in value ever since 2017 it's not hard to see why that bitcoin is actually secretly worthless it's value only exists because we believe in it but let's be realistic look at facebook's libra us government attacked him continuously he's a threatening him you know they intimidated him if bitcoins founder to be ever found who'd most likely get assassinated and consider that it has actually zero intrinsic value and when you consider that bitcoin's values only in the belief that bitcoin is valuable which is going down eventually you can start to see why that bitcoin is secretly the worst possible investment in the entire world ever by far. now listening to robert breedlove, watch here live: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlale9x2jka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlale9x2jka) usd on the other hand only expresses the values, wants, and needs of the most powerful and elite members of society. this defi token isn't decentralized, immutable, or permissionless like bitcoin.but scarcity is a comparative advantage.do you think it can flip bitcoin in market cap?

[removed] hey guys, i'm fairly new to crypto, only been in the community for a few months now, and i'm buying small amounts on a weekly basis. i have a question about cashing out your crypto though.let's say that bitcoin has a 10x, and now i have 10k worth of bitcoin in my wallet, how would i go about cashing that out? i know you are not supposed to keep any money on an exchange, since they are very unsecured. so would i just convert all my bitcoin into usdcoin and slowly cash it out in small 100 dollar incriments? or what would be the best route to take when it comes time to cash out?thanks guys! i've been wanting to buy my first eth for the last months but it keeps going up i'm not sure if i should buy now or wait till it makes a considerable dip. as per the advice buy the dips but then people are saying eth could double by the end of the year so maybe i should just buy now are there any other eth virgins like me in this predicament?

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i've been buying from coinbase primarily. additionally, i've purchased from uniswap for erc20 altcoins by connecting my coinbase wallet.unfortunately, coinbase's limits/timelines on buying/converting/transferring crypto have been pretty inconvenient. also, their fees are a bit high and keep requiring me to buy eth for mining costs.  any recommendations that can circumvent these issues?i'm looking at diversifying with xdai and dot right now.my plan currently is just to move all my crypto to the ledger nano s and connect the wallet to kraken for conversion/trading. does that seem like a sound move? ledger would take care of storing all my crypto in one place for simplicity and i'd assume kraken has most altcoins on their exchange.(sorry if my logic is lacking somewhere. i'm new to this.) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i'm trying to understand it but just like with many other complex things it's always kind of explained but not really.my biggest question is where the money comes from. i just read this sentence on a different thread where they're talking about where yield comes from:&gt;	yield is coming from traders paying fees to borrowwhich traders and where are they trading?why do those traders need to borrow anything?traders do trades and borrowers borrow. how does that work together?what kind of fees are those if it gives yieldfarmers 100%+ returns? that's worse than current ethereum fees. and also who is issuing those fees?i'm so confused with all of this and i have no idea what to think of it. [removed] [removed] [removed] block size limits and a dynamic transaction fee market with surge pricing are extremely important when it comes to cryptos like ether and bitcoin.block size limits means that the sender must self-appraise the value of their economic activity relative to other economic activity recorded on the blockchain in the present and future. this feature incentivizes thoughtful and planned out economic activity on the part of the users.it can be thought of as a dynamic toll on the blockchain highway. in exchange for using the blockchain rails, the user trades a self-stratifying price discriminatory toll that allows miners to profitably process the most valuable transactions first. this creates order and efficiency in the system.to appreciate these features, its helpful to consider the opposite scenario: infinite block size and infinite transaction capacity.in an infinite block size scenario, the user has no incentive to self-appraise the value of their economic activity. it allows for casual unimportant transactions that could easily wait another day or two. it implies that all economic activity is important. it implies that there should be no limit to economic activity on any given day.both systems have their pros and cons, and each kind gains legitimacy from the backing of its users.

both btc and the dollar are means of expression of value. but what is value and where does it come from?let's turn to world history. many of you, since school, have heard about how financial transactions were carried out in the days before the first minted coins. right. people resorted to barter, or used various materials and products, the function of which was to express value. for example, in ancient russia, before the appearance of the first money, cowrie shells or precious items served as exchange currency. but if everything is more or less clear with jewelry, then how could shellfish shells become a medium of exchange?it's all about trust, which was based on a generally accepted fact in society - shells can be exchanged for goods. such an agreement forced people to trust this currency, which ultimately shaped its value.so, the key factor in shaping the value of a currency is the presence of public trust. some of you may tell me that the value of money comes from a country's gold reserves or debt obligations, but no. this is not entirely true. gold and treaties are only needed to bolster public confidence in the currency. to create the illusion that the purchasing power of our money is protected. by themselves, they have no value. we ourselves attach great importance to these things and believe in it. in other words, if thousands of years ago it had occurred to someone that glass is much more expensive than gold, then today our attitude towards these materials would be completely different.later, when the practice of producing minted money spread throughout the world, each major city could have its own currency. and the value of this currency was based on the trust placed in the ruling family. any high-profile scandal associated with the issuer of banknotes, the difficult financial situation of people in power, or a change in the amount of precious metal in the composition of the coin could lead to a loss of confidence on the part of the population. loss of confidence and subsequent death of the currency.hopefully, in the example above, you can see similarities to what is happening with tokens and weak cryptocurrencies these days. their value is also highly dependent on the trust placed in them by the community. and in order to earn this very trust, cryptocurrency issuing teams are spent on expensive listings and new partnerships.the power and value of any money is primarily based on our trust in it. whether it's fiat money or cryptocurrencies, the value of both types of money depends only on people's attitudes. and any other security is nothing more than a deliberate invention. you and i are forced to believe that paper money has value backed by gold or securities. but in reality, the ruble, dollar, euro or any other traditional currency is a bubble that has existed for many years and lives only because its existence is artificially supported. and if btc is a bubble, how is it different from paper money? due to its autonomy from governments? limited emission?any money is a material expression of value. but progress does not stand still. with the advent of the internet, our lives have changed. study, business, relationships - our whole world is moving into digital space, and it is more than foolish to expect that such an "evolution" will not affect the world of finance.yesterday we created payment systems, proving to ourselves that value does not have to be materially transferred. today bitcoin was born. he appeared and reminded us that money does not need intermediaries and fake collateral. only human trust.cryptocurrencies are a new form of money. therefore, they must be purchased and used. we are at the origins of the modernization of the financial system. modernization, which can no longer be stopped.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_if you are interested in earning cryptocurrencies, then join our affiliate program. see pinned posts on our profile page for details. earn bitcoin by providing good answers. e.g. the latest 3 questions have incentives for 550k sats, 131k sats, 100k sats at this time. if you answer has the most votes and stays like that for 3 days then the money is yours.the way it works is anyone can add anonymous incentives to any question. the site tracks which answer has the most votes and how long its been in that position. after 3 days the author of a signed answer can claim the funds via a lighting invoice. folks also need to pay sats to vote or post: 1 sat equals 1 vote. posts cost 2 sats. the money paid for votes and post on the website goes to the operator (me) to stack and support hosting expenses. yet 100% the money put into incentives goes back to the customers.i encourage everyone to try using the site and earn some sats, yet if you dont feel like doing that now then here video of how it looks from the customers perspective: https://twitter.com/alevchuk/status/1288532085762711553you can stop reading now, yet if interested here is my story and how this website was built:i started this project about 1.5 years ago by forking a much older project that has been around for 10 years: biostarts.org (forum focusing on bioinformatics) - i made contributions to biostarts.org back in 2011 and in good standing with the original author. lastly, the biostars.org is still a very active q&amp;a at about 9k unique visitors per day.i remove all use of cookies. replaced google sign sign-on with lightning payments backend powered by multiple nodes that i run. removed a lot of other things and added the incentives feature. the plan is to continue to improve privacy by removing all javascript and opening an tor address to the site. also have some wild ideas about how to make this website distributed so that other operators can participate in hosting it. yet, thats for another post.im new to reddit, before i was mostly hanging out on twitter. ask for a friend. he bought 1.5 btc back in 2010 and put it in a wallet with bip38 encrypted private key and totally forgot about this until the price rose to 20k in 2017, he still has the paper wallet but couldn't remember any more the password to decrypt the private key.  when created this wallet he barely understand how bitcoin works and just created a paper wallet following a tutorial he found on internet. the password is fairly long he vaguely remember.fast forward to 2020, he found in the old hard disk a password protected zip file name mybitcoinkey.zip which contains a .txt file. new hope arise but he wonder anyone can do a service to hack the file? of course he is willing to pay part of the wallet to the guy.

forward to hearing what progress is being made in one of cryptos most ambitious competetive gaming and streaming platforms.  we feel ceo pattrick would not be having this interview unless there was some positive news to be had.  progress had slowed the last year or so and confidence had droped. as much as this has been bad for sentiment it also makes it the perfect time to get involved as the market cap is so low.  we are exspecting a big rise in attention to plair after the interview as boxmining has 211,000 subscribers and many more casual viewers. plair just recently made a partnership with justbet where pla and vet can be used on the platform.  to me this also shows that vechain is still backing plair and pattrick has told us that he plans to meet up with sunny and vechain team as soon as he gets back into china as covid has left him stranded in hong kong. pattrick reassured us that all big investors such as tim draper are still involved with plair and to me this is confidence enough as they dont continue to associate them selvs with projects they dont believe in.  if you are unaware breyer capital actually removed ethereum from there investments but are still invested in vechain.to get your hands on some pla and be part of the upcoming future of gaming the best place to aquire it is is vechains official exchange oceanexhttps://oceanex.pro/signup?referral=plr4s4also

popular projects, along with some long shots. sometimes i even feature projects i personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. i feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and

meant to be financial advice, but instead to be an educational discussion. everyone is responsible for doing their own research. the idea that bitcoin's supremacy as "sound money" is very frequently thrown around by the biggest talking heads in the crypto world. i know i will get a lot of hate for suggesting that this theory is not only flawed, but it is straight up wrong. as unintuitive as it may sound to bitcoin maximalists (no offense intended) i believe ethereum is on the path to becoming the global leading asset and model for sound money... give me a chance to explain why.&amp;#x200b;1. **the idea that nothing can change bitcoin's issuance schedule is a myth**. there is absolutely no divine power controlling the supply of bitcoin. contrary to what is commonly asserted, bitcoin's issuance protocol is not primarily driven by what is currently implemented. the real driver is consensus: the majority of network participants must agree that what is currently defined must not be changed. there is an underlying assumption that the consensus would never want to change bitcoin's issuance. on the surface this makes for a nice "sound money" narrative, but it is false premise and sticking to it could be ultimately detrimental. it presents a long term sustainability issue (the hope that somehow bitcoin's base layer will scale enough to maintain security entirely through fees). it also completely dismisses the possibility that an unforeseen event could create pressure to change the issuance. if bitcoin managed to create a consensus mechanism that did not rely on mining, it it very likely there would be consensus to reduce issuance. on the other hand, if some potentially catastrophic event would create incentives to increase the issuance, it would only make sense for the network to achieve consensus to do so.2. **issuance flexibility is not fundamentally bad.** etheruem's approach to adjust the issuance according to the contextual circumstances has resulted in a faster rate of issuance reduction than what was originally defined in the protocol. the rate of issuance will continue to decrease as new developments allow for it to happen without compromising the network security. there is a very high probability that ethereum will achieve a lower issuance rate  than bitcoin in the next two years, and it could possibly achieve zero issuance in the next five years. this would be a result of a successful implementation of pos, shading and eip-1559.3. **the root of all evil is proof of work**. pow is by far the primary cost of operating the bitcoin network. it is the primary determinant of how much issuance is needed as a financial incentive to keep miners doing their thing. the very mechanism that secures the network's decentralization is unfortunately quite wasteful. the degree of decentralization is a direct result of how much random mathematical operations are being done by miners.4. **there is a better way**. some people will take offense by the use of the word wasteful, and they claim that it is not because those mindless calculations are what is actually securing the network. however, its wasteful aspect becomes clear if there is a different way to achieve equal or superior decentralization without the need to crunch mathematical problems. this just so happens to be embodied in ethereum's design of proof of stake. it will drastically reduce the cost of securing the network, while providing at least 2-3% annual returns for the ownership of ether. when ethereum's issuance becomes lower than its staking rewards, it will effectively have achieved the same effect as having zero (or possibly negative) issuance.5. **the value proposition of etheruem 2.0 is unmatched.** there is just absolutely no asset in the world that has a 2-3% self-denominated annual returns and just so happens to be rapidly appreciating. when wall-street's greed sees this, it will create the mother of all bubbles.6. **don't dismiss the flippening.** on february 01 2018 ethereum reached 70% of bitcoin's marked cap. that happened before defi, before proof of staking was withing reach, before effectrive layer 2 was a thing,  before wrapped bitcoins and before the first signs of mass adoption use cases were actually on the table (like integration with reddit, visa). utility is a huge factor in driving prices, lets not forget how silk road played a key role into propelling bitcoin's value. yes, etheruem crashed hard after the peak in 2018, but perhaps it is simply manifesting a higher volatility pattern that is reminiscent of bitcoin's early years. bitcoin's first 5 years were characterized by aggressive price swings, why should it be different for etheruem (considering it is about 5 years younger than bitcoin)? if the volatility patterns stands on this bull market, we will see a flippening.so... do i think etheruem will flip? yes i do, but i still hold bitcoin. no one has crystal ball, and nothing is certain. perhaps etheruem will crash and burn, perhaps bitcoin will become the next yahoo, and perhaps they will both thrive in this new exciting crypto world. i want to conduct a case study on the bittrex exchange. i want to be fully transparent with you. my intent is to use this data to become a product manager for a cryptocurrency company or exchange. i want to see if my background can fix any issues

why don't you use bittrex? why do you like bittrex? really anything that can pop into your head.&amp;#x200b;of course, i would like to make them better, so any suggestions for improvements would be great too. i've been reading, *'bitcoin billionaire: a true story of genius, betrayal and redemption'*, and found this little analogy explaining how bitcoin mining works, attributed in the narrative to cameron winklevoss. i don't know how well the analogy holds, but for a non-techy like me, i found it helpful:*the little boy in the movie...is looking for a golden ticket inside candy bars. charlie is a like a miner. and the golden ticket, which will grant him a tour of willy wonkas factory, is like the block reward. now suppose that by searching for this golden ticket, charlie is also simultaneously validating purchases of candy bars and recording them in the factorys business ledgerthe willy wonka blockchain. and suppose there are many charlies all around the world doing the same thing, searching for that golden ticket. as they open wonka bars, they are auditing the wonka blockchain and checking one anothers work. willy wonkas contest has miraculously incentivized children around the world to work together to validate and record transactions of wonka bars, helping willy keep track of who paid for what, thereby protecting his profits and ensuring that his factory stays in business and can continue to make chocolate for everyone.*voorhees smiled. *thats very good. and it perfectly illustrates the magic of bitcoin. instead of middlemen, or gatekeepers, you have an open competition of miners, individually incentivized to validate transactions. no bank or government sits in judgment of transactions, or takes a piece of each slice of pie. middlemen are replaced with math, or in the case of your example, an army of charlie buckets.**and the willy wonka of bitcoin,* tyler said. *who set all of this in motion: satoshi nakamoto.* [removed] [removed] i have

DOWN //POSTDATACOMPILED// by the end of 2021, 90% of all bitcoin will have been mined! is it worth cashing out my ethereum for btc? i hold a variety of coins including ripple, dash, eth, eth classic, stellar lumens, chainlink, btc cash, and basic attention token. i bought bat at $0.12 so i made a pretty penny on it. btc cash seems like garbage but i still hold it. i am definetly not on the defi gambling wave btw so i don't want to know anything about those coins.

[removed] *the new scheme developed through the emurgo-ergo partnership will see oracle pools  core blockchain infrastructure  run as a public service, accessible by any dapp and developer, free at the point of use.*oracles are a crucial element of defi infrastructure. they are the bridge between the siloed world of the blockchain and data from the real world, and so are vital for defi to reach its full potential. the integrity of major use cases, including stablecoins and lending platforms, rely on oracles that are fit for purpose.current oracle implementations fall short of the ideal. one of the first projects undertaken as part of the emurgo-ergo partnership is research into oracle pools: a new way of bringing data from the outside world into the blockchain, and making it readily available for any dapp.**the shortcomings of current implementations**oracles already underpin many decentralised applications on ethereum, and typically work in the following way:1. a dapp wishes to acquire information from the outside world and makes a request to an oracle by paying into its smart contract (payments are typically made using a dedicated oracle token).2. the oracle obtains the data and submits it back to the contract that called it via a separate transaction.3. the information is sent solely to the dapp that requested it, and no one else can use that data without paying.while this works relatively well, typical oracles can essentially be considered as private services that employ a pay-to-play model. as this was clearly insufficient for many use cases, the concept of data feeds was developed in order to improve the user experience for common pricing information.current data feeds on ethereum, however, tend to be implemented in a very trusted manner. they lack a generalized approach that provides assurance about the reliability of the data, both in regards to its accuracy as well as its posting schedule. furthermore, such approaches tend to have no clear decentralized funding mechanism to make them sustainable over the long term, but instead rely on sponsorship by centralized actors.ergo and emurgos view is that oracles are too important to be restricted in this way. they should be public infrastructure for the defi sector. the oracle pools model developed through the partnership addresses this need.**oracle pool design**ergos utxo model offers benefits for oracle systems that were not previously available. pools of oracles act to decentralise the provision of data, ensuring that both the process and the data itself are more reliable.at their simplest, oracle pools break up time into fixed epochs (e.g. 6 hours), which are subdivided into blocks (e.g. 180 two-minute blocks). the group of oracles within the pool agree on the data sources and each post their data points to the blockchain in their own utxo.at the end of an epoch these data points are averaged, after removing outliers, in a final transaction which reads each data point utxo. this results in the oracle pool producing a new finalized datapoint, and moving forward towards the next epoch.this is not particularly complicated to understand, but lays a solid foundation. one critical factor to note is that the whole process occurs on-chain. moreover, the use of utxos enables the addition of incentives and governance mechanisms, allowing far greater sophistication and flexibility of oracle pools and data provision than was previously possible.**building on the foundation of utxo-based oracle pools**as mentioned previously, it is possible to implement incentives and penalties in the pools to help ensure the quality and timeliness of the data they provide. oracles put up collateral  a certain amount of ada, erg, etc  to participate in a pool. coins are removed from their balance (stake slashing) if they fail to do their job properly, e.g. if they fail to collect other oracles datapoints, if they submit a wildly inaccurate datapoint (an outlier), or if they do not submit a datapoint in a timely fashion. this ensures that oracles do their job well. the collateral is the blockchains native currency, not a separate token, simplifying matters and improving economic incentives.the model also enables governance voting to determine key parameters for oracle pools. the governance community can decide variables such as how long the epoch is, how much oracles get paid for posting valid data points, the minimum collateral they require, the number of oracles per pool, and so on. there is a high degree of flexibility, and parameters can be changed based on current needs. new oracles can be invited to a pool, others removed, and so on.this model incorporates a strict posting schedule (epochs) and governance directly, which projects such as chainlink do not have. effectively, oracle pools become mini daos that aim to provide the best service and can compete according to the service they provide in a free market, thereby improving the overall quality of data that everyone uses.**payment model**the utxo model means that results are posted to the blockchain and are available for anyone to use for the cost of a transaction fee. this is not the standard pay-to-play approach: dapps can access data for next to nothing. furthermore, this access to oracle pool data scales cleanly and at no extra cost even if more complicated protocols are built on top of oracle pools (such as hierarchies, or time-weighted averages).oracle pools are paid for by the dapps that use them over time. while everyone can use oracles and everyone who uses them has an incentive to fund them, this costs very little  a small percentage of extra fees on a given dapp. it is expected that these oracle pool payments will be implemented in major dapps, therefore ensuring that pools always have the funds they need to function.it makes most sense that large, flagship applications like stablecoins, wallets, decentralised exchanges, lending protocols, and so on, would pay for key oracle pools  in much the same way that key blockchain companies run their own nodes. its part of their operation and part of their corporate social responsibility, to borrow a term from the business world. its how they guarantee access to the data they need, help keep the ecosystem healthy, and show they are serious about staying the distance in the defi sector. at the same time, oracle pools are designed so that even small actors can run their own and have a funding mechanism baked in if they find a sufficient user base.the pools model means the funds paid can be disbursed effectively, within a range of different pool structures. it would be possible to have a pool-of-pools, with several oracle pools aggregating data and those results being pooled and averaged. the payment goes to the top pool, which pays funds out to the next pools down in the hierarchy according to how reliable they are, and those pools distribute funds to the most reliable oracles within them. the main advantage is that it is simple for the user, since only one payment to the top pool is required.there is also scope for using signed data  data from trusted entities like large exchanges. these can submit signed data to first-to-post pools, where the funds are distributed to the first oracle to record data to the blockchain; because they are trusted, the averaging process is not necessary. or there can be pools that aggregate partially signed and partially unsigned data, giving the best of both worlds. signed and unsigned data points can be pooled and brought together into a single datapoint, and payouts can still be made cleanly by paying the top pool.this is the first implementation to come from the emurgo-ergo collaboration: the first steps in building out the utxo-based defi ecosystem. there will be much more to come, and new developments promise to be very exciting.for further background, watch emurgo researcher **robert kornacki explain oracle pools***the new scheme developed through the emurgo-ergo partnership will see oracle pools  core blockchain infrastructure  run as a public service, accessible by any dapp and developer, free at the point of use.*oracles are a crucial element of defi infrastructure. they are the bridge between the siloed world of the blockchain and data from the real world, and so are vital for defi to reach its full potential. the integrity of major use cases, including stablecoins and lending platforms, rely on oracles that are fit for purpose.current oracle implementations fall short of the ideal. one of the first projects undertaken as part of the emurgo-ergo partnership is research into oracle pools: a new way of bringing data from the outside world into the blockchain, and making it readily available for any dapp.**the shortcomings of current implementations**oracles already underpin many decentralised applications on ethereum, and typically work in the following way:1. a dapp wishes to acquire information from the outside world and makes a request to an oracle by paying into its smart contract (payments are typically made using a dedicated oracle token).2. the oracle obtains the data and submits it back to the contract that called it via a separate transaction.3. the information is sent solely to the dapp that requested it, and no one else can use that data without paying.while this works relatively well, typical oracles can essentially be considered as private services that employ a pay-to-play model. as this was clearly insufficient for many use cases, the concept of data feeds was developed in order to improve the user experience for common pricing information.current data feeds on ethereum, however, tend to be implemented in a very trusted manner. they lack a generalized approach that provides assurance about the reliability of the data, both in regards to its accuracy as well as its posting schedule. furthermore, such approaches tend to have no clear decentralized funding mechanism to make them sustainable over the long term, but instead rely on sponsorship by centralized actors.ergo and emurgos view is that oracles are too important to be restricted in this way. they should be public infrastructure for the defi sector. the oracle pools model developed through the partnership addresses this need.**oracle pool design**ergos utxo model offers benefits for oracle systems that were not previously available. pools of oracles act to decentralise the provision of data, ensuring that both the process and the data itself are more reliable.at their simplest, oracle pools break up time into fixed epochs (e.g. 6 hours), which are subdivided into blocks (e.g. 180 two-minute blocks). the group of oracles within the pool agree on the data sources and each post their data points to the blockchain in their own utxo.at the end of an epoch these data points are averaged, after removing outliers, in a final transaction which reads each data point utxo. this results in the oracle pool producing a new finalized datapoint, and moving forward towards the next epoch.this is not particularly complicated to understand, but lays a solid foundation. one critical factor to note is that the whole process occurs on-chain. moreover, the use of utxos enables the addition of incentives and governance mechanisms, allowing far greater sophistication and flexibility of oracle pools and data provision than was previously possible.**building on the foundation of utxo-based oracle pools**as mentioned previously, it is possible to implement incentives and penalties in the pools to help ensure the quality and timeliness of the data they provide. oracles put up collateral  a certain amount of ada, erg, etc  to participate in a pool. coins are removed from their balance (stake slashing) if they fail to do their job properly, e.g. if they fail to collect other oracles datapoints, if they submit a wildly inaccurate datapoint (an outlier), or if they do not submit a datapoint in a timely fashion. this ensures that oracles do their job well. the collateral is the blockchains native currency, not a separate token, simplifying matters and improving economic incentives.the model also enables governance voting to determine key parameters for oracle pools. the governance community can decide variables such as how long the epoch is, how much oracles get paid for posting valid data points, the minimum collateral they require, the number of oracles per pool, and so on. there is a high degree of flexibility, and parameters can be changed based on current needs. new oracles can be invited to a pool, others removed, and so on.this model incorporates a strict posting schedule (epochs) and governance directly, which projects such as chainlink do not have. effectively, oracle pools become mini daos that aim to provide the best service and can compete according to the service they provide in a free market, thereby improving the overall quality of data that everyone uses.**payment model**the utxo model means that results are posted to the blockchain and are available for anyone to use for the cost of a

(also all stake is  in the blockchains native currency, rather than a custom token like  link)* an oracles job inside of a pool is to source and guarantee that  external data is posted onto the blockchain in timely manner. this is a  job that has actual value, and makes 3rd parties who arent the source  of the data actual valuable participants. this is a consequence of the  epoch design of oracle pools which doesnt exist in chainlink. thus for  datafeeds, chainlink oracles are effectively useless middlemen that  simply take a cut, which in oracle pools the oracles themselves are  performing the equivalent of a timely delivery service.* oracle pools have multiple approaches for incorporating governance  (chainlink has none). furthermore oracle pool governance is very  flexible and has a stronger impact than chainlinks passive reputation  system. this means that oracle pools can use internal governance where  individual oracles (who all have a game theoretic incentive to act well  in order to earn money) vote on parameters/the list of oracles, or an  external governance dao which distributes the responsibility to a large  number of dao members can be used too. due to the longevity of oracle  pools, an external reputation system isnt required, but instead direct  action can be taken through the governance mechanism to immediately  improve the quality of data and remove bad actors. this direct approach  provides immediate effects which has a much greater impact for the  end-user (furthermore a reputation system can still additionally be  built on top if so desired, where if any oracle is kicked out of one  pool their global reputation decreases).* oracle pools provide greater sybil attack resistance and general  assurance because the individual oracles part of the pool willingly  co-ordinate and come together in order to launch their oracle pool.  chainlinks more individualized approach to oracles tied with a bidding  process is akin to hiring mercenaries/thugs who have no allegiances and  are prone to mutiny at the drop of a dime if it benefits them (and in  this case you cant tell if the different groups of thugs youve hired  arent actually conspiring together and/or the same person). oracle  pools in this point of view, can be viewed more as a cooperative of  oracles who know each other and have aligned incentives together with a  common goal. they are significantly more likely to perform their job as  expected, but if they dont, disincentives and governance are in place  to ensure they are severely penalized and removed. this is a shift in  core philosophy of how oracles are chosen with a focus on using market  dynamics *between competing oracle pools*, rather than competing individual oracles. and with this, a lot more assurance is provided to the end users.* thanks to extended utxo, we can construct arbitrarily large oracle  datapoint hierarchies of confidence easily which make it possible to  have pools of pools (continuing to higher tiers as well) and thereby  scale accuracy upwards at the cost of price/speed. this isnt possible  with chainklinks design, because oracles are inherently sole actors,  and there is no design for aggregating aggregators, and having that  scale. furthermore, the lack of the utxo model prevents such hierarchies  from working well at all. the accumulation of data upwards through the  hierarchy and the dispersal of funds from the top downwards are both an  order of magnitude more complex to perform (and likely more prone to  bugs/errors), which translates to higher costs and making it an open  question whether it is viable at all on an account-based model.* furthermore, datapoints generated by an oracle pool (on a utxo  system with data-inputs) are accessible by anyone at next to no extra  cost. this means that they can be used by any dapp on the blockchain  easily, thereby making oracle pools much more like a public good. thus  even small p2p smart contracts between two individuals (say in africa  who cant afford paying for oracle data explicitly) can still have  access to vital oracle datafeeds. this is something extremely novel, and  quite exciting in my book.* it is trivial for a dapp to use datapoints from multiple oracle  pools in a single tx. allows for more complex defi dapps to come about  while still being reasonably priced.* because oracle pool datapoints can be used by anyone on the chain  after they are produced, that means everyone on the blockchain has an  incentive to submit funds to said oracle pool to keep the datafeed  going. thanks to the utxo model, this can be very done very easily in a  passive manner where dapps require users to create an extra output utxo  in their tx which goes to an oracle pool and contains a very small  amount of funds (ex. $0.05 equivalent). these tiny amounts are barely  felt by the users, yet they accumulate quickly and provide a steady  stream of funds for the oracle pool to ensure it continues to run  smoothly. thus oracle pools provide us with a whole new experience,  where users passively fund oracle pools and thereby produce datafeeds  that essentially become a public good.* because oracle pools have longevity and are easy to fund, the  blockchain ecosystem can focus on building key permanent oracle pools  with incentives/disincentives in place, together with baked-in  governance for parameters + entry into the oracle pool (which aids in  ensuring sybil attack resistance by actors involved). thus we can create  trustworthy oracle datafeeds that anyone on the blockchain can use.  this is a vastly different vision than what chainlink is attempting to  build, and in my opinion much more exciting. our approach is more  targeted/opinionated, and together with the extended utxo model,  provides a number of benefits that are completely novel.

i have been into bitcoin for a few years and i used to tell my friends all about it. i explained much of the basics and for them to further their education abou it but most importantly to buy. they saw it go from 2k to 20k and shrugged it off (they called it off for being to volatile) fast forward to 2020 .. i no longer would like to talk to anyone about btc except my immediate family. i hate not telling people (especially close friends) to buy when they do not see this as an actual asset. any thoughts? wouldn't it be enough to just encrypt the current hdseed together with its current keypool?why generating a new hdseed and a new extra keypool? sup everyone,totally new here. just bought a little bit of bitcoin today so let's see how that goes. quick question, i'm using coinbase for this and planning on investing what i can once a week. should i be transferring my funds to a wallet on my phone continuously? is it safe to keep everything on coinbase? finally, what additional security measures should i put on my phone and computer?thanks. anybody know what governs how much bitcoin gbtc is required to buy? my research has concluded that the premium fluctuates pretty wildly, so it doesnt look like there are significant controls? however i know gbtc has been steadily buying coins all throughout the year. i think maybe each share has to be worth a minimum amount of bitcoin? just wondering what the arguments are the different views other than the whitepaper and conservative stance on the actual number.was there even a reason satoshi choose 21 million or is it a random number? i get that it takes a 100 years to mine almost all bitcoin but why not a 1000 years?i know this has happened within this space before for other cryptocurrencies and from my point of view it had a positive side effect to it. title says it really.  i'd like to know if there's a way to exchange bitcoin (or any currency really) for usd if i'm under 18.  i tried using coinbase but you've got to enter a social security number for that, and i really don't want to do that. so im (27f) rounding out the end my cybersecurity bachelors degree and i decided to take an 8 week course on blockchain as one of my electives. bad move. the professor is one of the most un-personable professors ive had in the last four years. his lectures are pre-recorded on youtube (and outdated since 2018). how should i deal? i know its only 8 weeks, but i need to figure out how to make this class interesting so i learn something...or at least teach someone else something cool. any thoughts? im trying to get creative! the us dollar a government controlled currency that is printed into existence whenever the government deems it appropriate.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] hello everybody.i've been trading btc futures on binance for a few months now, but i'm only now noticing a very annoying problem which i'm really struggling to understand.to put it in a few words, i don't understand why every time i close a futures position, some money magically disappears from the account in the process.i'll explain what i mean with an example:sometimes i'd open a trade and close when the pnl is at +$100. but when i close the position, the actual profit seems to be something like +$90 or even +$80 at times.why is this happening? is it fees? is it spread?i've tried checking the trade history but i make many trades in a day so it's hard to calculate for every single trade.needless to say, i've been steadily losing money due to this occurrence, sometimes even when i close my positions at break even or at a small profit.so what i wanted to ask is:are there better platforms for intraday futures trading than binance's?some time ago i remember watching a youtuber mentioning a website where you pay one time each month and then you can trade leveraged futures without fees. does anybody know which broker is this?thanks! i encountered ampl a few days ago (thanks datadash!). i read the white paper and am trying to work out how this project could play out. this is a really neat experiment in money/economics. it's fair to say we're all curious to see where this project will go in the long run.i have a "thought experiment" i would like your feedback on. i understand ampleforth as essentially being an experiment to see if a bunch of us can all agree that 1 ampl is equal to 1 usd (continually inflation-adjusted at 2019 levels).as more and people people get into the space, the network effect causes the statement "1 ampl is = 1 usd @ 2019 value" to be more and more true. the people who entered the network early benefit because their percentage of the network is getting larger in the current usd terms. in a sense, new ampl is created as the network keeps getting larger in what's could be called a "proof of faith" mechanism. it's been said before that money is essentially a belief system, and the ampleforth experiment is literally an exercise on that principle.the next question that comes to mind is - has the current network effect already passed a critical-mass threshold? has a mc of \~500 million (at the time of writing this) triggered relentless positive feedback loop? sure, in the local cycle we might top off somewhere and crash down again. but if the floor of the next crash is, say, 50 million, can that bottomed-out mc have enough network effect potential to revv up again? if the answer is yes, and another cycle initiates, it's reasonable to assume that even more people will join than the last cycle. and while the next top might be twice the last top, these wild flucuations will begin to temper down if in the months/?years the bottomed-out mcs becomes large enough to have some inertia. at that time, ampl will be less of as investment asset and more of a useful store of value (as it's pegged to the 2019 usd purchasing power) if we do see ampleforth succeed in this way, where might it's mc stabilize?thoughts and opinions welcome. investing aside, this is the most interesting thing i've encountered in crypto since i took the red pill. [removed] [removed] [removed] i started mining eth with betterhash and it's showing that i'm making over $100 per month.https://i.imgur.com/twdflyj.pngthis seemed like a lot so i put my info into a mining calculator, and it showed that even with free electricity and no pool fee, i'd only be making $25 a month.https://i.imgur.com/iq9chon.pngso which of these is right? my graphics card is an nvidia gtx 1080 ti.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] inspired by the creative application of public key cryptography to finances through cryptocurrency, i would like to ask this community to help me structure and present an idea to our legislators.  speaking from the perspective of a us citizen, when we hold elections we can only trust that our power in this republic - our voice/vote - is actually heard or counted.  once we fill out that ballot and feed it into the machine or place it in the pile, we have to trust that it gets counted and that nothing is altered.i propose we cast digitally signed votes on an anonymized public tally.  at a high level, the benefits would be:1)  every citizen can count all votes2)  we can have reasonable assurance that each vote was cast by those represented (validation of a digital signature by a provided public key)3)  every citizen can locate their own vote, giving the assurance that their vote was counted4)  every citizen can see that their own vote indicates the correct candidate - that their vote wasn't alteredmy ideas do not necessarily involve blockchain, though i'm sure somebody could find an argument for the immutability.  i envision a paradigm similar to certification authorities and the process of obtaining a public trusted ssl certificate for a website.  each voter would generate a key pair and would sign a request for a voter certificate from a voter registration authority.  voter registration would make them jump through some hoops to verify their identity, and then would issue a voter certificate much like a ca would issue an ssl certificate.when it's time to vote, the voter would use their private key to cast a digitally signed vote.  the certificate and signed vote would be added to a public tally.  after the voting period ends (i think this should be several days or even a week, honestly), then a public validation and remediation period could begin.  every citizen could parse the public tally and count the votes for themselves.  every citizen could verify the digital signature of every vote using the provided respective public key indicated in the certificate.  we could each locate our own vote knowing our own public key and verify that all is correct.if people start coming forward with reports of missing or altered votes, we would have confirmation that some sort of tampering or key compromise has taken place.  we could then remediate as necessary until we have arrived at a fair and transparent election.what are your thoughts?  are any who have a more advanced understanding of cryptography and/or coding experience willing to consider and analyze this?  i would like to identify as many problems as possible, but i would also like to welcome ideas for how to tackle those problems.thank you!

[removed] [removed] ethereum and all the ethereum based defi coins have been exploding in value the past few months. the problem with this rally is obviously that it's not necessarily new people to crypto buying these coins, it's the same traders just trading among themselves pushing the price up.when bitcoin breaks 20k, which really isn't that far away, defi is either going to crash or accelerate it's bubble in warp speed then crash. either way, i see ethereum going to 2k or beyond then back down to 300.

or do you pay taxes on all 110 dollars, im pretty sure its just the gains but i wanted to make sure, thx i buy and sell bitcoin at very good rates...no matter what country you're at.if you don't have a wallet, do not be worried.i will give you directions on how to get your wallet set up and ready to receive and send btc in minutes. here's what i'm trying to do. i basically want the functionality of a blockchain explorer but offline.with a full node (bitcoind) you can use the command getaddressinfo &lt;address&gt; and get some info but not transactions or totals.is there a command i can use similarly but to query a public address to see the total btc or last/all transactions with amounts?basically i want a watch only wallet but without broadcasting over any network that i am looking at these addresses.i know i can make a database out of the blockchain but that's pretty involved, is there another way i can do it?thanks eight gold bars said to be worth 750,000 (nz$1.48 million) are being auctioned off in the uk after they were seized from a passenger flying to dubai.the haul was found in the lunch box of a flyer at manchester airport by hm revenue and customs in 2018, but under new civil proceeds of crime powers laws, the bars are being sold off this week.all the proceeds are going back into the public purse, so will be spent on services including hospitals and schools.the gold bars weighed in at 16kg, or as the customs described it, the average weight of an adult staffordshire bull terrier.the passenger who had been carrying the bars has not faced criminal prosecution.gill hilton, assistant director at hmrc's fraud investigation service, said it was the first time the 2017 criminal finance act had been used to seize and forfeit a listed asset, and it should act as a deterrent to criminals looking to trade assets such as precious metals.if they are the proceeds of crime or intended for unlawful conduct, we now have the powers to take them from criminals."we are determined to cut off the funds that finance serious crime in the uk." i have used my [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) wallet for years. i mainly used it on my mobile, so did not have to authorize via email every time. one day i got kicked out of my wallet on the phone. i decide to log in again. the wallet said to check email for authorization. i got no email. i tried login on desktop, still no authorization email.i decided to contact [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) support. after waiting 3 weeks they finally replied with solution to change the email of my wallet. i agreed. when i tried to change email i got an error message saying: "email does not match the email address associated with this wallet."wtf? blockchain wallet somehow deleted or changed my email, so i can't access my wallet anymore.i decided to restore wallet from backup. did restoration process and got access to completely different wallet that has not been used for 4 years. i literally have emails about receiving a transaction few month back with my wallet id written in the email. but when i try to access the wallet with backup those transactions do not exist.now this wallet i'm getting access to is still mine, so it's possible that it somehow erased/lost data of past 4 years. i had only one blockchain wallet (and all emails i ever received from blockchain have same wallet id written in them), so it's not possible that i mixed my wallets.how is something like this possible?i totally lost trust in [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) wallet.i'm still talking to support, but they are slow. can anyone suggest a good tutorial for making a usb drive into a hardware wallet?

(most likely through some hardfork). i am confused, why do so many people love buying btc with cashapp, you are paying 1.25% too much. it really adds up in the long run. as title suggests - when purchasing bitcoin, bitbuy is a couple hundred dollars higher than market value. as a canadian, id like to find a place to transact more fairly. can anyone offer help? who do you think will win this race till the end of 2020 ? have those of you who use cashapp had any issues withdrawing fiat from btc? do they do anything shaddy if you used a mixer or anything?

[removed] greetings fellowship of the ring,for those of you panicking about the dump, i bring news, whispers from birds and tales of glory. the oracle of satoshi has appeared to me recently through a vision induced on lsd. in this vision, the oracle revealed many great secrets, ancient knowledge and future knowledge about many things. in one vision,the oracle of satoshi revealed to me that bitcoin will never have a monthly close below $10k, ever again.make of the vision as you will, but remember, the light of the oracle has now touched you, proceed as you wish. hi, i have a question,&amp;#x200b;my goal in blockchain is to recive about 3000dol in crypto/ eth or btc, exchange it to eur.&amp;#x200b;1.then if its possible get a card and buy stuff in amazon etc...  is that possible?&amp;#x200b;2.if not do i have to send it all to my bank account after i exchange.? can someone please explain me why satoshi's 1 million btc wallet is not visible on the blockchain? first let me say i believe in bitcoin, i have bitcoin and i hope it will be more widely adopted. but this potential wide adoption makes me wonder if, in the long term, there really are enough satoshis? there are 100 million sats in one bitcoin. there are only going to be 21 million bitcoin, thousands of which are already lost. let us assume bitcoin is a world currency in the future, almost everyone has some bitcoin. the average number of sats for 7 billion people is 300k. considering there are going to be more people one century from now and even more bitcoin lost this number is sure to be lower. lets say 200k, just to give us a number. so more and more bitcoin are lost as time goes on, sats here and there. for how long can you say bitcoin is almost infinately dividable? clearly that is no longer the case for everyday consumables when even just one sat is very precious. buying a bottle of coke for one sat might be like paying 10k dollars for a bottle of coke today.do you get what i'm saying? in the very long term, how is one sat not too precious to use for every day use? [removed] [removed] [removed] i have to take my online business underground for legal and tax reasons. that means no more banks and bank accounts. i have to keep all my assets on my hard drive.no im not a bitcoin freak. yes i use bitcoin, and yes i save some, but most of my money is going to stable coins, crypto-dollars and crypto-euro. like tether and usd coin.these stablecoins are as good as real fiat money, they wont lose value but wont skyrocket either. only issue is that i am responsible for banking security so if i get hacked all my money is permanently gone.what advice do you have? im thinking of setting up a dedicated cryptocurrency server by buying a laptop, installing the best firewall and antivirus, and using that computer for nothing else. i have recently invested in hardware wallet and was little curious how you guys carry them or don't carry them at all?seed should be in the safest place but is anything safe at all?so many questions. i can't be the only one getting a little frustrated? the ~~s&amp;p500~~ s&amp;p5 (faang) have seen ridiculous gains in the past few months. it's fair to say btc has also enjoyed a nice little run up too, but nothing near that of the faang stocks.i do truly believe that bitcoin will have a meteoric rise soon, but if not now, when? to me, it seems like all of the conditions are ripe, a bubbling s&amp;p5, brrrr'ing like we've never seen brrr'ing before, failing currencies (venezuela, argentina, lebanon), and geopolitical issues that should make people see the utility and worth of a decentralised digital asset such as bitcoin. lightning is continuing to make waves too.to me, it's not just about making a quick buck out of bitcoin, it's about establishing a decentralised, unconfiscatable, borderless asset.  when we have a single corporation (apple) that currently has a market cap that is 10x of bitcoin's, it's a shock to the system. when we have a single guy like jeff besoz who's networth of $204bn could theoretically buy 93.5% of all bitcoins, it just doesn't sit right with me. i believe that bitcoin will succeed, but it needs a much higher market cap to get there.i'd love to hear other people's opinions on this. # how do for recover my bitcoin stolen in attonbank? okay so lets say i want to buy something linked to the performance of bitcoin on the equities market.what stocks/companies are on the major indexes working on this area for those of us that don't want to transfer money to crypto exchanges, figure out wallets, and all that stuff. i'm new to this and just wanted to know how do you turn money into bitcoin a safe way. https://ref.sharecash.co/wolfie45 hey guys/gals,since i am starting to accumulate a large sum of btc, for me at least, i would like to get it off the exchanges.i was wondering if there were any good wallets for my old phone?also, if i have a local wallet or even a ledger, can i get my btc back in case the physical device breaks down.electronics have been known to be unreliable from time to time.thanks in advance for helping this noob store his bitcoin safely :d im working to create a clone mostly just to learn about blockchain and i had a few questions about how consensus is made about what transactions should be in the next block and how people efficiently share node ip addresses in a decentralized way.if anyone has the answers to any of these it would be really great and if not im willing to read some documentation. thanks! so after watching this:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbfdvjcqmj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbfdvjcqmj4&amp;t=19s)got me thinking about the video i saw the day before about this:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cidq6iw9ac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cidq6iw9ac)&amp;#x200b;i'm going to get some sleep now, won't look into it until tomorrow, but do you guys think it's worth the time to go down that rabbit hole?there's probably no way we could verify 100% that these strange transactions are coming from people who know the yuan will be less valuable that toilet paper soon, right?just a gut feeling i got about a few hours ago....

[removed] [removed] hello,so im new into trading, well ive known about and dealt with btc since it beginning days but not in any kind of depth just person to person trades here and there.lately ive started to read a lot about trading in general, stocks, crypto etc.and today i was watching a token on an exchange, i was watching the trading books as new bids and sells come in and something caught my eye.out of nowhere (it seemed) a lot of buys of only 1.0 token per buy where registered and then sells of 1.0 token and this particular token/coin is worth around 4$ per coin.these buys and sells came in seconds after another and there were a lot of them among the other random buys and sells which got me thinking if this is a strategy of one person but why?they would loose money on the fee of doing tons of trades with only 1 token instead of making one or several smaller ones.the amount of profit per trade would be minimal but with 100's of them i guess you would make some cash but the fees and everything just makes me wonder.i hope i paint somewhat cohesive painting and you get what i mean.im mainly curious if this is some strategy and how it works? [removed] currently being trade at 2 satoshis [https://crex24.com/pt/exchange/nbr-btc](https://crex24.com/pt/exchange/nbr-btc) this crypto has a solid active team behind it, inumerous upgrades going on and it's practicaly free. i wouldn't pass up a chance like this one. it has reached over 300 statoshis in the past and will probably go much higher once it's given enough recognition. [removed] [removed] overall, we see the valuation of the crypto market becoming more resilient to the malpractice or malfunction of any given exchange.  granted bithumb is not coinbase or bitstamp, but it is still a significant exchange in asia.important to keep this in mind as the overall volatility of the crypto market tends to decrease as resiliency and confidence increases. i started watching crypto markets before the bullrun in 2016. what's taking place right now and since the beginning of august is an obvious shakeout of the weak hands in crypto. i too have fallen for this during the great bullrun of 2017, but quickly caught on. and tbh i have no intentions on going back to a shit/failing government backed currency so this is where my capital will remain, in my own hardware wallet with keys that are controlled by myself. so to those that are just entering the space, learn to be patient and don't trade on emotions because you will fail 9/10 times. good luck to all and btfd!

DOWN //POSTDATACOMPILED// hey all,i've recently took an interest in bitcoin, and totally not for the sole purpose of gambling. i just wanna know how anyone was motivated to buy btc in the first place.. the verification process is so painful.. its been over 3 days and blockchain, coinmama, coinspot and coinbase are still verifying my documents.. its just so tedious is all, there has to be a quicker way to buy btc without all this nonsense we are in late 2018. tsla just hit $75 (it recently split 5:1, so it was $300, but you get the idea), a new all-time high. helping the shareholders is elon musk making a now famous tweet that he's "taking the company private at $420" and that he has "secured financing."at the time, many people were shorting the stock, i.e., betting the stock was going to do down.almost immediately after, the stock crashes, eventually dipping below $35. a 50% decline.then, all of a sudden, tsla jumps to $180 per share. never seen before.again, many people line up and begin shorting it. coronachan helping, it falls below $85. many people say that tsla is dying, dead or a mix of the two. many say that the "bubble has popped."tesla hit $500 two days ago. even if you had bought it at the worst possible time in the last year - that is, a full $180 per share - you would have hit a near 200% return.and this is what bitcoin is, really. when you realize it only take a couple dozen people to influence, or rather manipulate the price, day to day action becomes irrelevant. you'd be shocked at how easy it is to crash the stock price of tesla, or bitcoin. it takes just a small coordinated effort and it's even easier on bitcoin, which is unregulated.but look at the big picture. tsla recovered quickly to $500. and so will bitcoin.the current bitcoin price is only relevant in two scenarios:1) if you plan to buy more2) if you badly, badly need money, but truth be told, you should have liquidity, i.e. bitcoins should be long term.other than that, what 2-3 manipulators decide bitcoin is worth today is utterly irrelevant to me. in 5 years, there will barely be any new bitcoins being made, and more and more people buy bitcoins for the long term every day. bitcoin is not like gold, you cannot mine a near limitless amount of it (more gold was being extracted in 2019 than ever before). bitcoin is bitcoin. 21m.so stop caring about the price unless you are in one of the two scenarios above. bitcoins price in the next 2-3-4-5 years is utterly irrelevant to you or me.thank you. [removed] looking for a wallet where ill be able to send from computer or iphone but have on both. so full disclosure i own gold, silver, and bitcoin but still have allot to learn about bitcoin. with that being said in learning about bitcoin i keep seeing this bashing between bitcoin and metals (gold &amp; silver) teams. what's up with that? we are coming from similar places, philosophically, in that fiat and central banks are nothing but trouble. even one of the central tenets of bitcoin "not your keys, not your coins" isn't that far from gold's "if you don't hold it, you don't own it".like i said, honest question, looking forward to a discussion and hopefully sharing. bitcoinhas been rising for most of this year. however, it experienced a sharp fall on september 3 losing up to 7% of its value to sink towards $10,500. the losses happened in less than two hours liquidating more than 100 million worth of longs in the process. taking a look atbitmexalone, the sudden crash wiped out almost $99 million worth of longs.three major factors might have likely caused a sudden drop in the price of the flagship crypto. the strength of the u.s. dollar, miner outflows, and major resistance are to blame for the sharp correction below $11k.miner outflowsaccording to reports that emerged earlier today, large-scale mining pools are sending higher-than-normal amounts of bitcoin to exchanges in recent days.this data indicated that miners were now preparing to sell their holdings which added selling pressure to the crypto markets. the ceo of cryptoquant, ki young-ju,wrote:miners send a certain amount of btc to exchanges periodically, so they already have a large amount of btc in the exchange. whenever they decided to sell, it seems they move a relatively significant amount of btcs to other wallets, and some of them are going to exchanges.miners represent one of the two sources of external selling pressure in the bitcoin market other than exchanges. when miners start to sell their holdings, it could cause considerable pressure on bitcoin.us dollar rallyin the past three days, the us dollar has rallied against all other reserve currencies. the dollar showed some strong momentum against the euro. based on previous reports, theeuropean central bank(ecb) warned that the euro has become quite expensive. the ecbs warnings rattled the markets resulting in a euro sell-off as most investors feared the imposition of various restrictions.as the us dollar started to rally from a multi-year support area, both gold and bitcoin declined steeply.bitcoin was at strong resistancethe $12,000 to $12,500 range has acted as a strong area of resistance for bitcoin since 2018. bitcoins price tested the $12,000 resistance level for the fourth time in a relatively short period. that might have led to a reaction from sellers which contributed to the pullback of bitcoin.\but the price of bitcoin dropped to as low as $10,625 across major exchanges. a well-known pseudonymous trader, salsa tekila, said it is a strong support level at a higher time frame. thus, a bounce is likely to happen in the near term. as long as it is the case (and it most definitely is) btc will never be a better investment tool than say...an etf. the hype around btc being decentralized isnt a thing anymore. it tracks the markets, period.that being so, this thing could be in for some considerable ongoing carnage, especially if biden is elected. and as long as the election is dragged out the way they are planning for (which i assure you will be through december), there will be no significant or sustained upside.like him or not, biden getting elected will result in absolute carnage insofar as the markets are concerned.institutions are hedging big. you should consider doing same in leu of cheerleading. [removed] please, please, please buy some bitcoin. it is so good you will love it. it is everything you ever wanted and it will go to the moon soon. have you talked to all your family members yet? maybe they have some extra cash. do you have any cash holdings? available credit? do you even love bitcoin? sell your assets, max out your credit cards, get life insurance, kill yourself and spend all the insurance money on bitcoin. just a casual and friendly reminder to please, please, please stop the current, definitely temporarary trend. thank you. [removed] bitcoin is expensive, like a car right now. the price keeps going up. many people want to own a full bitcoin, but most people can't afford $10k on a bitcoin. i know you can buy fractions, but if you buy fractions slow enough you may never get a full bitcoin because the price keeps going higher.&amp;#x200b;example bitcoin cost $10,000&amp;#x200b;so this would work like a car loan. you put 20% or $2,000you recieve 1 full bitcoin, but you don't get the keys until you finish paying off the loanmonthly payments at 5% apr interest for 5 years.  =  $189/month for 60 months.total cost of 1 bitcoin = $13,323&amp;#x200b;if bitcoin goes down below your equity value on the loan, you wont get liquidated unless you're late on payments. if bitcoin goes up and you miss a payment, you wont get liquidated until you fall below equity value, so you can miss some payments if bitcoin goes up.&amp;#x200b;thoughts? as the title suggests.i see posts of people asking whether to buy or not. no one knows but one thing is for sure, but when the election comes around in one month and stimulus starts drying out the stock market is going to crash, the feds can't qe forever. with that being said, bitcoin follows the stock market. today the stock market, dropped near 4%. bitcoin dropped 8% and in the plague like dips in march/april. bitcoin just doubles the dips of the stock market.&amp;#x200b;source: my ass. for those who are wondering what cme gaps are and why do the fill.[https://coinguides.org/cme-gap-explained/](https://coinguides.org/cme-gap-explained/) is what has said every fucking moron out there that tought a drop in the dollar valuation of bitcoin meant that the fundamentals weren't good.this is an opportunity. just like march was one. its not the time to be scared, it's time to be excited! the last sellers are currently selling! in theory could you do something like a mixer on the lightning network? i'm planning to switch from a regular exchange which i kycd in to a so called p2p exchange like paxful so i can get nonkyc coins. the problem is, i still kycd in the method of payment i'm gonna use, will it make a difference? [removed] - every fucking moron out there don't let these dips sway your thoughts into thinking doom and gloom.just remember this;1)fiat money has the ability to become worthless due to the fact that a central entity controls its production.  in times of crisis they'll print too much and as much as they could which will just cause everything out there to be worth less.2)companies (stocks) have the ability to become worthless as well being that they function on the dollar as a piggyback.  they got pumped due to the dollar, not because they did better business.  maybe amazon and tesla, but other companies no.3)bitcoin needs a democracy to become worthless, meaning that for bitcoin to become worthless 100% of its participants have to agree on this at the same time.  all miners have to shut down, all nodes have to shut down, many bitcoin businesses need to close doors, etc.bitcoin is the first time in human history that we have digital scarcity.  that alone will make bitcoin always worth it to everyone.  so do not become fazed by this.  just use this opportunity to buy more. because i can..... to help boost bitcoin's price back up. let's see some more brrr memes boys just exhausted. thats all. so we just bounced off $10,077. can someone explain what keeps driving us lower and if it is likely it will continue? after the price dropped this morning im scared. seeing that spike down made my heart drop. i just bought yesterday. im now scared that im gonna empty my bank account into bitcoin lol is this just a pullback? i thought 10,500 was the major support. was planning that to be the lowest/ floor.is this good news or just the best opportunity from here on out? i  want to get into crypto trading. now before anyone tells me that  hodling is better than trading and that i'm going to get rekt: i'm fully  aware that i'm not going to beat the market on day one and this is why i  want to practice until i can consistently do it.is  there a way to practice crypto trading with "fake" money? basically  something similar to a testnet but for exchanges. i know that i can just  dowload a portfolio app and just enter whatever imaginary trades i  want, but i think it would help if there were any real exchanges that  offer a simulation or fake money to get used to their exchange and  perhaps to use the api to test crypto trading bots.does  anyone know if a major exchange offers something like that? i googled a  few keywords together with the names of big exchanges and couldn't find  anything close to that. between 1978 and 1980, the hunt brothers were charged with market manipulation for attempting to corner the market on silver.  they managed to purchase 135 million oz of silver at a peak cost of $48.70 per oz.between 2018 and 2020, jp morgan chase purchased  $135 mioolon oz of silver and now own 53% of the world's above ground supply.  peak cost so far of $29.14 per oz. does anyone in this space use messari? they're a fairly young crypto analytical tool for investments. i was curious to get the thoughts of other people interested in crypto about whether or not messari is a useful tool and whether or not it's something we expect to grow as cryptocurrency gains popularity.specifcially:a) did you know about messari before this post?b) do you use messari in any way? this could range from using their articles just to research a particular coin or being an actual subscriber.c) do you think there's a use-case for this type of company in the crypto space? if so, do you think messari will be able to realize that market potential. if not, why don't you think it's a good use-case for crypto?d) if crypto continues to grow, do you think messari will be a hosuehold name in the crypto-space (as much as a crypto company can be a household name) in a few years or do you think they'll disappear?e) messari wants to essentially be the edgar databases of crypto, grow into the go-to data solution for crypto finances, and is one of a few companies attempting to become "the bloomberg of cryptocurrency". what do you think of this claim? can they do it. is someone else already further ahead, or will, ya know, bloomberg step in and be the bloomberg of crypto if it gets popular enough?thanks for any insight you can provide! [removed] hello,we invented and developed decentralized blockchain-based file validation service, see the article:[https://emercoin.com/en/news/file-validator](https://emercoin.com/en/news/file-validator)we would like to see your feedback, and answer your questions. thanks in advance. https://bitemycoin.com/opinion/how-to-cash-out-your-bitcoins-without-paying-taxes-5tips/ i want to run my own bitcoin nodei have rasberry pie but i don't know how to startcan someone share some tutorials/articles about running node i rasberryi also want t9 get into lighting network i am a nob so any articles/info would be much appreciatedthanks is jaxx liberty a good wallet or should i switch. if yes what is a good wallet that i can see on my phone aswell as a app is there a good online exchange for people who live in more than one country, have addresses and bank accounts across borders? (us/canada specifically)background for this question: i created a coinbase account and i can tell right away they aren't set up to understand some people live in more than one country. they only allow one address, id verification fails if your passport doesn't match the country setting for your account and you can't easily change the country setting. if you're an expat, a migrant, or just a regular traveler you know how this goes, some companies do online financial services like this and understand that people are international, others don't. coinbase clearly doesn't. would love to find one that gets it. thanks! i was recently scammed out of a fair amount of btc and i am trying to reach out as to if anyone could help me with this sorry if this is a really naive question, but how do people make a living from selling products that have to be bought with bitcoin? it's not like they can then use that bitcoin to buy food down the local supermarket. what i mean is if your whole business is based on selling only using bitcoin how do you survive? do you have to convert the bitcoin to fiat currency at some point? today i came up with an idea to empty inactive accounts like the one owned by satoshi nakamoto.the principle is to run mining nodes that try to hack what the private key of some user is, for example satoshi's keys, then archive nodes keep the ledger of the possible private keys that have been tried but didn't match the public key, and full nodes that verify the private key tested.to do so, the mining nodes need to cooperate in the sense that they only hack a slice of private keys. so they need to book the slice, which can be stored either in the bitcoin ledger or in a tailor-made own ledger.the drawback of using the bitcoin ledger is that it takes to pay to record those slices. this is why an own ledger and archive nodes could be the solution:1. when a mining node starts attacking a private key, it books a slice in the hack-ledger by telling the archive nodes (it takes few bytes) ;2. when the node has finished testing the possible private keys, it tells the full node each couple of 'private key - unmatched public key' tested (this would be the equivalent of proof of work) ;3. the full nodes verifies if the couples are true and if not the mining node is banned, otherwise they are sent to the archive node to record in the ledger as is (all the couples are recorded for further checks by other nodes. it also means that the computation is made a second time) ;4. if a mining node finds the private key matching the real public key, it takes all its money ;5. the archive nodes keep the list of the private keys that needs to be attacked, starting with the ones with the more money (and it also checks that the couples send by the full nodes are matching, so the computation is made a third time) ;6. the archive nodes keep the entire hack-ledger with up to 100 blocks of 'private key - unmatched public key' couples, and send it to each other to coordinate, and then only the slice is recorded to save memory ;7. every now and then the mining and full nodes check that the list given by an archive node is true by reading the real bitcoin ledger and if an archive node has a wrong list it is banned ;8. every now and then the archive nodes ask the mining nodes that have booked a slice where they are, if they gives no answer, the slice is freed.as i would be doing this in my spare time, it would take me some time to do, but i wanted to check first if some of you would be interested by the idea and could be running those kind of nodes, either home or on a host server.typically, each person would be running all three nodes. the interest of having full nodes would be to filtrate a first time before submitting to archive nodes as these are also in charge of the ledger. but feel free to improve the workflow.the idea is to attack the accounts that mined money in the early hours, and sometimes plenty of it, and then lost their keys.against random users, the attack would not be interesting for the possible gains would not worth the computation. hikraken has the option to stake bitcoin off chain.they say the btc is used for kraken margin pool.whats the risk of borrow bitcoin for krakens margin pool?i already know about the risk of leaving btc at any exchange.thanks [removed] [removed]

btc-rpc-explorerhttps://github.com/janoside/btc-rpc-exploreri have a full node via bitcoin qt. can i use qt for block explorer?i launch block explorer and i'm getting rpc error. the webpage states "check rpc connection info"the github project states i need server=1 and txindex=1. can i make qt run with these settings? i tried adding them to the .conf but how can i confirm qt is running with these options, in console somehow?in case i can't use qt for this i downloaded bitcoind. it looks like i can start the daemon with txindex=1 and server=1 but still getting same connection problem with btc-rpc-explorer.do i have to do -reindex=1? can i do that within qt? if not and i use bitcoin cli will it disrupt qt in any way?thanks for it to be a respected currency in the eyes of the masses it needs to be stable.for it to be a growth asset it needs volatility.how can bitcoin ever become a currency that everyone respects whilst also increasing (and decreasing) in value so significantly every day? it's time to buy! bitcoin is only a safe investment if you understand what it is, and how it will continue to be adopted into this world at this point in its life, regardless of the market price swings in the short term. because only then will you never cement a loss by panic selling, and then seeing bitcoin runaway in price while you're still out, therefore losing both your dollar value and your bitcoin position value.i've been in bitcoin for over 8 years now, and have seen many friends, family, and acquaintances come into bitcoin, and many panic sell and fud out during a down market. most eventually coming back after learning more about bitcoin, but some, for some it takes a long time to return. and for an even smaller few, well they never return, or at least not yet.&amp;#x200b;but in essence, bitcoin is only a safe investment if someone understands that their amount of bitcoin is more important than whatever dollar value it has in the short term. that all they should be focused on is acquiring more bitcoin, and that every 5 years after a halving happens, they'll see their coins grow in value. that they'll grow in value thanks to the math of its limited 21 million total coin supply, the new coin supply getting cut in half by the halvings making a more and more or the total supply being held by hodlers every year, and that its continued adoption into the global markets will always force it to eventually go up in price because those new adopters will always have to find what price those hodlers are willing to sell, finding bitcoins new value that hodlers are willing to sell each time that happens, regardless of the short term evaluation corrections after a parabolic runs.&amp;#x200b;corrections mind, you that on average are only 80%, leaving anyone in before a 1000% growth parabolic runs to still being up 200% as long as they bought before the parabolic run started. the .com stock fluctuations were fluctuating on averages of 99% corrections during its first 15 years of life from the '90s to the early 2000s. and the ones that survived those early days were previously the best investments in history before bitcoin came along. so bitcoin is holding a better correction in its early day pattern than the biggest internet companies when they started, and its returns have already broken any records they previously held. records they'll never be able to catch up to as bitcoin continues its path.&amp;#x200b;if they don't understand this, then even if they don't leave the market, they'll panic sell every time. and for some friends i know, they'll always sell at a dip right before a parabolic run, and then fomo back in at a new all-time high, only to experience the next correction and sell again at their break-even point. with this, losing more bitcoin position every time, but maintaining the same initial investment point which in their eyes as a win.&amp;#x200b;i have one friend who came in with 10k in 2013, and today in 2020 is still only at 10k thanks to this pattern of buying and selling. don't get me wrong, they've been up well over 100k$ at times, but they kept panicking selling at every parabolic run's slightest dip, then buying back in at the new all-time highs, only to then sell low in a repetitive cycle until they broke even.&amp;#x200b;people like that friend try to play the market, and yes while they do win sometimes, that pattern of buying and selling will almost always lead you to get rekt during times of parabolic growth, and correction. had my friend just held his initial 10k investment in 2013, he'd be a multi-millionaire right now. it's one of the most golden rules with investing in any market. if you try to play it, eventually it will play you. instead, just find a market on the path of growth, and longevity, and do everything you can to just increase your piece of that market's pie, no matter what the price. if it goes down in price in the short term, then just think of it like a rare gucci purse or limited edition rare popular shoes that are being released on sale. buy the damn discount and hold onto that shit until the market catches up with what you know and realizes it's true value.&amp;#x200b;because of all these experiences throughout the years, if i'm trying to help anyone start buying bitcoin, i tell them to learn about it first before buying any. to learn what it is, study its history, it's adoption growth, where it can be adopted, where it is being adopted, what it's limited 21 million coin supply is, and about what the halvings mean to its long term value. how it can and will be used, how they can protect it, etc. i always want them to learn enough about it to understand why hodling is so important, and that the only thing that matters is that they increase their bitcoin supply. that's the safest way to win in this game. without understanding that, then they're a financial danger to themselves if investing in bitcoin. not because bitcoin is a bad investment, but because they'll be a bad investor. is someone who thinks the market value will go down. abearmarket is a prolonged period of falling prices. markets starting to take deeper breathes, strap in folks! btc began its dump yesterday, today the stock market has its biggest pullback since june 11 lol. its supposed to be bull market, and there is no bad news. it doesnt make sense. its all gonna be ok guys! hey guys, quick question.my current strategy is buy btc on cashapp &gt; transfer btc from cashapp to coinbase &gt; transfer btc from coinbase to ledger.personally i find it easier to do this transfer so i can buy on my phone with cashapp, transfer to a desktop website like coinbase, and then be able to safely copy/paste the wallet to move to ledger on my desktop.am i running into more bullshit coinbase fees doing this, or is it more standard transactional fees? youre welcome goodbye lambo. i understand the concept of mining , where you use your computing power to solve a problem , and you get rewarded with a bitcoin  when you successfully solve.but i cant understand1. why i need to solve the problem. is it only for earning bitcoin ?2. whose/what transaction is that . whose problem am i solving ?might sound very nave, but i dont see answer for these anywhere,. dont worry bois papa trump will save us.he will not let dollar rise to much.dollar low = stocks high =&gt; happy americans =&gt; happy stockholders =&gt; trump re-elected.but most important dollar low =&gt; gold etc... up =&gt; bitcoin up. as this space reaches unprecedented levels of attention and trade volume; its getting a lot of coverage (some worse than others). does anyone know of a good bitcoin new source for analysis either text or audio? (not the cringy price analysis but coverage on the proliferation of a new technology via nascent applications) i just want to say what an enormous risk you are all taking.it's almost fall 2020, btc is almost 12 years old, and institutional investors are only beginning to **dip their toes** into btc. and just their little toes.the last 4 years have seen significant financial infrastructure built around btc such as bakkt, cme futures and other futures markets, plus institutional funds with firms such as fidelity investments, and even after all that, investors from traditional finance are only beginning to **think about** the possibility of allocating a small % of capitol into btc.do you seriously think these massive traditional finance players who are worth billions .... care about defi?defi is so off the radar of these people, most have probably never hear of it, and if you explained it to them they'd probably laugh and say "sounds like a nice toy".if you're in the crypto bubble, and are listening to the rantings of v. buterin, and other blue-checkmark figure heads from the space, it's easy to get sucked in by the propaganda and really believe that defi will change the world - and it might - but don't hold your breath. the fact is defi is built on a blockchain (ethereum) which has an enormous mountain to climb in terms of scaling beyond 15 tps, and the entire defi space is built on this blockchain. the ethereum blockchain size is ballooning out of control and soon will be out of the reach of the average hobbyist.btc on the other hand is built with incredible care and precision and nothing is rushed. it's blockchain and codebase are rock solid because the bitcoin ethos is quite the opposite of ethereum's: move slow and mend things. it's this attitude that has won btc the attention of institutional investors and is the reason why they are beginning to consider looking at it as part of their portfolios.i may be wrong, but i think ethereum is a long way off being seen as anything but a toy by these big institutional players - especially for all the promises it makes - such as being the "world computer". buzzwords are great, but high net-worth investors who know what they're doing do not invest in buzzwords. they perform rigorous analyses of the performance of the asset, the underlying algorithms and scour the entire ecosystem for any signs of inconsistencies or weaknesses.so the btc price has taken a bit of a tumble in the last day - i urge you to **stand firm** and do not sell your precious btc because you heard some random youtuber say that defi is the future.if you see this dip in price as anything other than an opportunity to accumulate more bitcoin, then you are on the wrong side of history. many bitcoiners i talk to have a deep resentment for banks and don't want them in charge of their money. for those of you who feel this way, does that mean that you are also against loans i.e. college loans, mortgages, car loans etc.? do you think bitcoin would help free us from loans? &amp;#x200b;*processing img c72uf321nsk51...*my audiovisual bitcoin art collection, a milestone release for my art career, drops tomorrow.*processing video xea70n8wnsk51...*for the drop on [nifty gateway](https://hodl-crypto-art.myshopify.com/admin/blogs/17992876147/articles/www.niftygateway.com), there will be a total of 6 different nft's (non-fungible tokens) in the collection. for each of the 3 pieces, there will be one full-length (1/1 auction) and one shorter version of the "money shot" of each. all 6 tokens are in video format with audio tracks.### details for each of the 6 nft's:**1) quantitative hardening (1/1) for auction:** full animation with audio effects (1:03) walking through the history of bitcoin's monetary policy with individual animations for the 4 key events: bitcoin genesis, first halving, second halving, third halving.*processing img uro7uqc9lxk51...**processing img 46bikiqclxk51...**processing img tijhce5glxk51...**processing img 34qf3sidlxk51...**processing img nupqh47yxuk51...**processing img l0on7sk3lxk51...**processing video iuouuog2osk51...*read the [blog post on quantitative hardening](https://luchopoletti.com/blogs/artwork/quantitative-hardening-audiovisual-bitcoin-art) for more info on this piece.2) gold with wings (1/1) for auction: full animation with audio effects (1:37) focused on the narrative of bitcoin as a better version of gold with individual animations for 4 characteristics of money where bitcoin outshines gold (with quotes and a tribute to each of the winklevoss twins): verifiability, portability, divisibility, scarcity.&amp;#x200b;*processing img lqit0u8plxk51...**processing img 1dxbxy0qlxk51...**processing img jg83eg7olxk51...**processing img 9mdba68tlxk51...*&amp;#x200b;*processing img azfaadoaevk51...**processing img snfpa6oaevk51...**processing img c728x5oaevk51...**processing video y4mp2a38osk51...*read the[blog post on gold with wings](https://luchopoletti.com/blogs/artwork/gold-with-wings-audiovisual-bitcoin-art)[ ](https://luchopoletti.com/blogs/artwork/gold-with-wings-audiovisual-bitcoin-art)for more info on this piece.3)freedom money (1/1) for auction: full animation with audio effects (1:35) focused on bitcoin as a fundamental freedom for society with individual animations for 4 fundamental freedoms and their relation to bitcoin and bitcoin's history: freedom of speech, press, religion, and money*processing img 9d7v0uqvlxk51...**processing img 0q5eaxnwlxk51...**processing img tm0a4w2xlxk51...*&amp;#x200b;*processing img n1sfkssxlxk51...**processing img h8dgjyf6mxk51...**processing img 5v57gk45mxk51...**processing video 0y3rsenbosk51...*read the [blog post on freedom money](https://luchopoletti.com/blogs/artwork/freedom-of-money-audiovisual-bitcoin-art) for more info on this piece.&amp;#x200b;*processing video 7iyykurqosk51...*### why did i title my milestone collection "audiovisual bitcoin art"?i will set the tone for my explanation here, with merriam webster's definition of "audiovisual":[definition of audiovisual](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/audiovisual)[**:**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/audiovisual) designed to aid in learning or teaching by making use of both hearing and sight.since embarking on this mission toeducate the masses about bitcoin using visual art, i have contemplated long and hard about how best to impact people with combinations of images and words.i've studied the words and practices ofexperts in social psychology and propagandafrom the likes of gustave le bon, edward bernays, friedrich nietzsche, and others.the voice of gustave le bon, particularly seems to always ring in my head as i take particular creative decisions, at times when questioning whether or not a certain image may resonate with "the crowd"*"the imagination of the crowds  is impressed above all by images.  it is possible to evoke them through the* *judicious* *use of* ***words*** *and* ***formulas****."**so here is my formula:***3 pieces of art** using the same structure, each with their own narrative, topropagatethe base idea "bitcoin is better money" with different groups of people: 1) the fundamental/economically focused, 2) the risk averse/wealthy, and 3) individuals who highly value freedom.**4 key points** for each of those narratives, animated with full audio tracks to create a more immersive viewing experience.**repetition and reinforcement** of the over-arching phrases and easy-to-understand aspects of the entire message for each.all 3 pieces will also be released on collector's edition prints via [www.luchopoletti.com](https://www.luchopoletti.com).each print will offer the audiovisual experience of the animation in an augmented reality layer via the artivive app. i don't mean in terms of privacy, which all my web searches seem to assume. but rather, if i set up a new wallet from an existing seed, how does that wallet know what transactions have sent me bitcoin, and vice versa?

[removed] [removed] [removed] nothing like the sweet success of stacking sats off the back of a shitcoin. long live bitcoin! fuck tron and fuck justin sun. for the record, i still have some trx in my hodl portfolio, but i wanted to shout out my good fortune as i'm able to stack a little extra btc while the market dips. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] if a particular address is known to hold hacked "marked" btc or another crypto currency deposits their tokens onto a defi website.  then they withdraw the loan amount and attempt to cashes it out to fiat via an exchange, would we be able to track those stolen coins? or would the hacker get away free with the loaned coins.  the only price they pay is the difference between collateral and loan as a loss, they also probably pay exhorborent miner fees but that's another story. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i'm not just talking about buying discounted tokens. on days when the market is down across the board, information appears that is hidden on other days. if you look at the top 200 coins by market cap, only 18 of them are in the green at the time i'm writing this. is it possible those are some of the more bullish projects in the space right now? i think so.today i created a new coingecko account with a 'instant email' via [guerillamail.com](https://guerillamail.com) (quickest way i could find to make a new account). then i added those 18 tokens to my portfolio. now i will login to that account periodically to track their progress and research the projects. theoretically i should wait for a price drop to buy any of these, but some of them could be decent buys if their upward momentum is that strong.i'm not saying this is a great strategy to make profits, i'm saying it's a good way to educate yourself on market movements. the other thing i learned today is it's a bad idea to have all your funds locked in alts and btc/eth, because on down days you have great buying opportunities, but you are paralyzed because you don't want to sell anything and take a substantial loss. if i had 30% of my funds in usdt, i would be able to make some good moves today.btw here are the 18 gainers from the past 24 hours (will have changed by now):ksm(15%)  dot(6%)  trx(8%)  xem(3%)  uma(1%)  yfi(6%)  ewt(4%) btt(1%) lrc(11%) ar(3%) jst(9%) akro(22%)  trac(32%) trade (32%)  based(59%) nec(15%)  ava(6%)  sbree(25%) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] sup gang.my  electricity is free (included in rent) was thinking of buying an asic  miner or constructing a small rig to mine? is this still profitable?  (please dont link me to whattomine)i  recently started mining through nichehash on my gaming pc which has a  1070 and an i5 but wondering if its better to have a separate machine?&amp;#x200b;thanks in advance!cc [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i was going to proper format this but you guys dont deserve it. if you know more than this, feel free to correct me.first, i am 80% certain about this knowledge.second, i dont care if you dont understand what is being said here. all of you can take something away from this. if you dont read it, you are a lifelong idiot and you should just get out of crypto tbh.third, youre welcome.first we need to get into our heads that defi is not being pumped by retail investors, or at least initially it wasnt. thats my opinion anyway, but lets get down to why i think its institutional money locked up and why yearn finance is doing so bloody well.defi is not staking something to get some stupid native sushi token. sure, yearn finance does provide yfi native token but even the creator said its worthless, not that anyone cares.the true value in defi is that all those promises of game changing smart contracts from 2017? well guess what, they work now, and theyre being used now.there are a chain of key decentralised services (smart contracts) that provide a very lucrative yield for institutional investors who might not want to invest in actual crypto. more on that later.the key players and i may forget a couple:uniswap, yearn finance (curve.fi), chainlink, dydx, balancer, aave and more.you can actually see with the first three (which are the most important imo) are being cloned. we are literally in the phase of key projects being copied and were about to see if copies can coexist (sushi, yfii/yfv, band). that how far into the experiment we are. this is not the end by any means, but definitely not the beginning.so, back to institutional money. lets say im an institutional investor and i have $100 million set aside for high risk high reward but not btc risk level.i can convert real usd into usdc or dai and directly stake these into a pool and receive interest, right? 5-10% a year?wrong.through yearn finance and all the decentralised services chained together, what happens is my $100 million is staked and earns interest. however because its defi and controlled my smart contracts, my $100 million stake can also be used as collateral for a loan from say, aave (ahh now you see why it pumped). now i take a loan, for say 80% of my collateral which is $80 million. all in usdc if desired btw (maybe not on aave).i can now stake this $80 million even though my original $100 million is earning interest. so now i have another $80 million earning interest, which can also be used as collateral. so i take another $64 million dollar loan in usdc and stake it again and so on.its almost like how banks take your money then loan it out over and over and make heaps of % while you make jack shit, only because this is decentralised and managed by collateral you get the %%%.now this leads to some pretty good % returns, but its not all.these pools of funds are huge. what, theyre just providing liquidity? i mean dont get me wrong they get a lot of money by doing that but. what happened when theres an arbitration opportunity? maybe the usdt-usd trading pair got unbalanced and you can make good money by being first to take advantage. or maybe an actual decentralised exchange has a price different for traditional arb (idk if this one actually occurs). what do you think happens?they use their funds to make the trade?haha good joke.they use decentralised margin platforms in the chain of defi smart contracts to take out a huge margin loan and race against the other smart contracts trying to do the same thing. its like bots in smart contract form.now why do they do this, isnt this unsafe?nope. because the blockchain groups all transactions in a block together, they all occur at the same time. that means the code in the smart contracts can calculate the profit or loss through oracles like chainlink, and check if the result is profitable even with insanely high gas fees (which again, are bots outbidding each other, not retail investors).if its profitable, the code is executed and recorded on the blockchain.if its not profitable, the code simply does not run.this is called an atomic feature of smart contract programming and does not exist in regular programming.these arbitration smart contract bots? that entire chain from pool of collateralised assets to decentralised margin to chainlink oracle check to gas fee check to end calculation? that is all one transaction. one block. thats the power of defi - atomic transactions.so why the fuck would i not choose to do this with $100 million usdc collateral? when i can choose to keep it all in stablecoin returns?gas fees are skyrocketing because of this. not because of you. not because of me.uniswap, compound, yearn finance, chainlink, they all changed the game. and now bzx is back online after 7 months of security audits after a related flash swap hack.watch gas fees skyrocket over the next few months.btw gas fees for these incredibly complex smart contract chains are not like $10-$50 for you and me. they cost thousands. even the cost to use chainlinks oracle skyrockets as smart contracts try to outbid each other to get correct pricing for calculations.tl;dr anything thats not in this comment is not defi, its not yield farming, its liquidity mining and tokenomics trickery. im not saying it wont moon or whatever but learn what youre buying into.typed this on my phone, was going to format it nicely but you guys dont deserve it. if you have any corrections please, please comment because i love learning this stuff.also the annual returns for these pools is like 90-100% but because they get yfi token through staking in yearn finance which does most of this automagically, including the yfi price increase the annual return has been 1000-2000%. no, that number is not sustainable, but the 90-100%? itll probably stick around.

[removed] bitcoin on sale now. viva bitcoin . i've been thinking about an idea for about 2 months that doesn't go out of my head.would it be a good idea to ask for a loan of let's say 40-50k eur to buy \~5 btc? let's say i only need about 40k to get to buy it. i would pay around 500-600 eur per month (i can use part of what i have taken on the loan and have not used), which i can assume more or less well since my salary is around 1500-1700 depending on the month.the loan would be as long as possible (4-5 years) since the idea is to hold 1-2 years until the next big pump and take it off at once, and on the way have bought btc at a good price.if i am writing it here, it is to discourage me from doing something like that if you find it very stupid. i used hodl hodl yesterday for the first time. it worked great, but for the not-so-big amount of btc amount i bought, the transaction fee was a bit painful. googling i find 2019 news saying hodl hodl is unabling lightning, but in the actual web i see no trace of it. is it just a plan? has anyone used it? how can they deliver instant giftcard? from where they purchase the gift cards? curious what the best strategy for dollar cost averaging investments is that people have found while keeping the lowest level of fees. currently i am making ach deposits into coinbase pro and then investing within a 5 day span of it reaching my account. then i send to my wallet or blockfi. i don't like how long coinbase pro takes to receive the ach deposit but i'm not sure if there is a way around that. does anyone else have strategies that work for them?&amp;#x200b;thanks for the feedback! #toothemoon guys, i'd appreciate it if tell us what you think about our new show:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mokx8sumo3m&amp;feature=share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mokx8sumo3m&amp;feature=share)weekly news coverage on the crypto space. if you download a software wallet and store your private key, that wallet should be just as secure as a hardware wallet, right?

[removed] mostly all here are invested into crypto. we all have our own reasons, methods, values of how we invest our money.   one thing in common is we all have one main goal. that is to get as much money as possible out of this with the time, and money we can spare.##that's the dam truth##.we are all here together, and since we are all here on our own will , i want to tell you why you should be proud to hold all your crypto.i'm 40 years old.  at 18 after i graduated hs i had about $7800. $1400 from my graduation party, and $6400 selling my mtg collection on ebay.  i also managed a small arcade for about $350 a week.back to my mtg collection...i sold it because it changed. the designs on the new series looked too modern. the original designs were a work of art.anyway, i seriously wanted to hold those magic cards but i kept telling myself...*"i can get them back if i want. the price isn't going to move anytime soon. the market is in slight decline. some of these have been the same price for 2 years now."*i was right, the price of my two lotus's stayed the same for 5 more years. not budging . 12 years later after that , those same two cards value at over $60,000ea i believe.  if i held untill a few years ago or now, i would've been able to do a quick sale at $400,000. yes at a discount.the same goes for all the first edition garbage pail kids i had.##so, what did i do with all $7800##?i told myself i want to invest it into microsoft.  but i talked myself out of it by saying*"some people told me the market was a risk, and i had to prepare myself to lose it all"*so i didn't do it.  i was close, but i didn't.  i could've had over a million!i instead used that money for a school. business computer programming.it was a waste because 90% of what they taught me came natural. i was doing basic programming at 13 for fun.i regret not going with my initial fomo on microsoft , i regret listening to my own fud with the mtg cards.7 years later, i repeated the same mistake...i had about $15,000 in the bank. i wanted to invest $10,000 in apple after i read about the release of the iphone. instead opted to do 5k over fud i read. it was fud about the risk since they never made phones, and alot of people were ridiculing their idea.then i said to myself...*"fuck that, i don't want to do this. i could do so much more with this 5k"*i instead used the 15k turbocharge my transam, add a racing transmission, tires, rims, new stero system, and i took a 2 week vacation ...gone!i got what i wanted. got laid a bunch of times, went to car shows.  that could of been $500k by now.to top this off, i missed out on a quick $78,000 win at the racetrack because if my own fud. horses.i lost $200, and was left with only i $5 that night.  i decided, "you know what, fuck it, i'm going to do a completely off the wall wild bet.i did a completely wild bet for $5.  i picked all longshots in what they call a "superfecta"(4 horses in that exact order 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th place prediction.1 minute before the race started, i cancelled the bet.  i told myself ...*"this is stupid, 99:1, 78:1, 56:1, 38:1 long shots coming out in this order? thats insane...why am i blowing 5 away?  fuck that, i instead put $5 on the 10:1 to win hopefully my to maybe get $50 back "*well.   guess what? the 3nd largest superfecta payout in history.  no body won it! it came out in the original order i out it in that's to a series of freak disqualifications in the race.i hate myself for cancelling that. but hey, maybe that happened for a reason.  maybe i wouldn't have ended up living on another country for 2 years. learning another language.you seeso many times in my life i had the perfect opportunity, and i didn't take it.    i let fear, uncertainty, and doubt make my choices for me.then came crypto currency.  in late 2016, a client of mine told me he got rich off bitcoin.  he raved about it .  he told me about ripple, eth etc.i invested in his recommendation about xrp when it was $0.005. it flew up from there. i took some of that massive gain and bought other things, and those flew. for someone like me, it was lots of money off my original $500.sure this was a "lucky time" to get in but that's not the point i'm trying to make here.  the point is that i finally did it!  i didn't let fud fuck with my head. i just did it.   i cashed out already in late 2017. about 90% of what i gained. payed off all my debt, and my truck, and had another $30k or so to put a down payment on a house.     if i didn't just stick with my guns and let the fud get to me, then i would still be in a whole bunch of debt. especially with this whole lockdown bullshit.  but now....now ,i never again i will tell myself...*"if only i did that when i had the chance"*now i never have to say that again! i dont give a shit if it tanks another 50% from here because it's all house money.  i now never have to say ...*"if only i did it"*now i did!crypto currency is severely undervalued. its manipulated down right now. this about this logic, how can something increasingly popular with more and more support by the day drop in price? crypto isn't human. bitcoin isnt getting fired over sexual harrassement, there isn't a corporate takeover. its manipulation.i don't care if this shit takes 5 years to recover. i'm holding . i don't care if btc dips to $1000. i'm holding till this mcap tops 10 trillion.so if you love your crypto, hold that f#%king shit!the lesson here is never let fud make choices for you. stick to your original beliefs. if there's a voice in the back of your head telling you "i want to do this", then listen to that voice.  that's you!  listen to yourself, not the new voice that intrudes after your choice. [removed] [removed] [removed] hello, i have some money invested in several good known cryptocurrencies. i buy everything on coinbase with high fees. my question is: is there another exchange with lower fees, available in europe and also listed with more less known crypto? because i wanted to play a little bit with some shitcoins. reactions will be appreciated -today's crypto of the day is lto network, and it's current price is $0.1113.-since 2/18/20, every day i have featured a new crypto of the day for us to discuss. i try to make follow up posts within a week, but i am behind at the moment. i try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. sometimes i even feature projects i personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. i feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. at this point, i plan to try to continue making these posts until i have completed a full year.-if you decide to reply, please add something more than, "scam" or "this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020". please say why. if it is a scam, link or show evidence. if you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? it seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags.-i strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. there is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. you may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. i know i certainly did!https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/search?q=author%3ajoenorwood77&amp;restrict_sr=on-these posts are not meant to be financial advice, but instead to be an educational discussion. everyone is responsible for doing their own research. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] complete noob in the quantum computing space, but as the title states, how big of a threat does quantum computing pose to cryptocurrency? i consistently see comments about how quantum computing poses a huge threat to cryptocurrency's usefulness.&amp;#x200b;also, when could quantum computing become developed enough to pose a threat? [removed] goodmorning reddit. recently tried to sell xrp on vindax at market price of 25 cents. when selling all xrp at market price, it went through at 10cents and i basically lost more than half in usdt. wtf happened? this has also occurred when market buying another coin at market the price increased from 0.10 cents to 55usd on bsy coin . is this vindax bugged or is this user error? i really need an explanation because its bothering me so bad. i usually trade on coinbase pro and i haven't tried any other exchanges but if i'm looking to buy a crypto not supported by coinbase and transfer it when it becomes available, what exchanges will allow me to transfer it to coinbase? (sorry if it's a dumb question, i'm still kinda new to this whole crypto thing.) as per title. i currently have it in my ledger s nano and was thinking its as easy as sending it back into my coinbase and then utilizing coinbase to do the transfer to my bank since its connected there already. however, wasnt sure if the fees would be too much or if its the safest with that large amount. any input/suggestions? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] so weve reached a point where there are a bunch of sketchy farmable tokens pulling the rug. to those of us that have been around for a while this is no surprise. most of these tokens are get rich quick schemes and everyone should be very careful.the problem is that people in this sub are already lumping legitimate projects in with the rest. i can understand the confusion, but sushi is likely to emerge as a serious uniswap competitor. cream looks to be an improvement over compound in almost every way. im not saying you should buy these tokens, im saying most of this sub has no idea what cream even is.i hear people saying things like if you buy a coin called sushi or hotdog you get what you deserve. how ridiculous to assume the validity of a project based on its name.dyor. ask people who code solidity to look over the github. question the devs directly...but please stop calling tokens a scam when you have no idea what the contract does or how it works. youre not helping. [removed] so once i've set up my hardware wallet, is there any reason to ever plug in said wallet unless it's to send btc from it to somewhere else?so far i'm just slowly building my portfolio depositing a few times a month, and unless i'm looking at withdrawing the coin from the wallet there wouldn't be any reason to plug it in correct? i obviously might be wrong, but it seems that we have some things that can lead us towards a bearish stock market and affect assets globally:1 - geopolitical desire to move away from the chinese powerhouse, which means production of electronics will some more expensive;2 - gov injecting usd in the market is a game that some richer are throwing a hot potato on each other's lap, if there is diminished electronics consumption there is no sense in apple, say, continue to pump only with printed usd;3 - the tech stock market has been in a clear contradictory bubble trend amid covid19 problems, which is shrinking gdp and that is changing wildly the interactions in society as we know;4 - i mean no offense, but americans as a group of people are insane right now, my jaw drops every time i see videos of insane people in civil unrest in stores and protests, shooting each; this is wild uncertainty;5 - trump re-election can happen, if it happens i'm not sure it will be nice to pow done in china; no, i don't think he will "ban bitcoin", i think he will do something against the source of electricity, e.g. mongolian coal; this can change significantly who the market makers are and how they price the product of their mining activities; why i think that? because the uk, au and the us are aligned in this;6 - if biden is elected, i'm not sure it will be good neither, but that would require me to go into "out-of-my-ass" political opinions, i'll save it.bottom line is, we are in the middle of events of history books level. no one can predict shit, so that's why i think people will liquidate everything.

[removed] [removed] i want to buy some btc, but i don't want to go through an exchange that makes me give out all my personal information, so i heard about local cryptos. i'm browsing through it, but it seems like all the people with good ratings are offering like 25% above (or more) market price.why? are there other options? [removed] [removed] [removed] okay i feel that it's time for a little rant and/or random thoughts about the current state of the crypto market. more specifically, looking back a couple of years and looking forward.first of all, does anyone remember that just last march, bitcoin was trading between 4,000 and 5,000 dollars? somehow the new 10k+ reality feels like ages, so the sudden drop from the 12k to the 10k range sounds really bad, but please remember we're still 200-250% up from just march this year.secondly, crypto has changed. altcoins used to be a great opportunity to make some *dumb* money. random coin x was hyped through the roof and random coin y was doing an ico which skyrocketed +500% as soon as the word binance was even uttered by someone. today, you're lucky to make 200% if you're **smart and patient enough** to pick the right coin at the right time. let's take a couple of "prime" examples:**2017 &gt; 2018: just some examples*** **oyster pearl:** went from 3-4 cents to 3-4 dollars in a few months, that's making 10 grand of your $100* **request network:** went from 4-5 cents to a dollars in a few months, that's making 2 grand of your $100* **power ledger:** went from 16 cents to 1,60 in a few months, that's making a grand of your $100* **verge:** went from sub 1 cent to 0,20 in a few months, that's making 3 grand of your $100* even high-cap coins like **iota** went from 20-30 cents to 3 dollars in a few months, that's making a grand of your $100these are just ***some*** examples, there are ***many*** more. and then we move on to the "drought" of the past 2.5 years, where just \*some\* coins perform well**2019 &gt; 2020: just a few notable exceptions*** **chainlink:** went from sub 1 dollar to 20 dollars and now back to 11 dollars* **tezos:** went from 40 cents to 4 dollars and now back to 2-3 dollars* **bnb:** went from 6 dollars to 40 dollars and now back to 20 dollarsall in all, i feel like the first significant btc drop in 2018 and the demise of bitconnect was around the time when the crytpo market slowly became a snoozefest. we all realized that we had been in a tulip mania around that time and everything plummeted. that was exactly the time when crypto became less interesting, heck even boring.i genuinly hope that the crypto market opens up towards the future, giving both the technology (i know right) and the people who are investing in the technology a good time. personally i will wait until there's a covid vaccine before investing again, when hopefully the world will start getting back to "normal" (whatever that means).**tl;dr:** 2017/2018 good, 2019/2020 bad [removed] i saw this a few days ago as the mcap was ramping up, gas fees sky high, yet people were still trading.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/teather expanded thier mcap instantly by an increase of 30%, "usd backed...." 10 bill to 13bill. we then see a large ramp up in speculation followed by a dump.there is a good paper covering the shadyness of usdt[is bitcoin really un-tethered?](https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ssrn-id3480263.pdf)october 28, 2019 [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed]

[removed] how does the bitcoin protocol ensure that all miners recieve the transactions in the same order?say miner a recieves a transaction tx and later it recieves a transaction ty. another miner b, who is closer to the emisor of ty, recieves ty first and later tx.if there's no consensus on the transactions order within a block his two miners will work on different ordered blocks, producing different hashes. how is the order granted? who else does?  those were some gooberish days werent they?  ill wait.  as i buy more all the way to the floor. let me preface by saying this is not meant to be criticism or hate towards bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, etc. i've invested thousands in bitcoin in the past, hodled like you wouldn't believe through its massive ups and downs, and bought/sold it multiple times along with other cryptos. i see its potential as a legitimate currency, or rather i did.but therein lies the issue i've been struggling with. to my understanding, the main function of a currency is to spend it and use it to purchase things and to pay bills. bitcoin, a currency, is surely intended for such uses as well, as are other crypto*currencies* across the market. therefore, why has this function not gone mainstream with bitcoin yet? why aren't that many people using cryptos to actually spend it on things, which is literally the purpose of any currency? and if that isn't their main purpose, why are they called currencies?it just seems like a very tiny percentage of people who own bitcoin actually spend it on things, and even less do so regularly. it seems the vast majority of people who purchase it simply do so with the intention to sell it later at a higher price or to add value to their investment portfolio. this is perfectly fine, of course, but that can't possibly be the main function of bitcoin if it's meant to be a currency, something meant to be spent on things.then there's the argument that not enough people are familiar with bitcoin...that argument just doesn't hold anymore, especially with its value having peaked (so far) at $20k in late 2017 and continuing above 11,000 until just recently. pretty much everyone and their grandma has heard of bitcoin at this point and knows what it is. there's also the issue of not many major online retailers currently accepting bitcoin as a form of payment, like amazon, ebay, walmart, target, apple etc. and they drive the vast majority of ecommerce.my guess is its value is too volatile and unstable for people to treat it the same way they treat their actual money (usd, etc.). it seems its fluctuating value has dwarfed its true purpose; since its value is so unsteady, people see it as having potential to increase a return on their investment if they later sell it for a profit. so they'd rather just do that than to actually spend it on a new pair of shoes or something. plus, say what you will about the diminishing value of the us dollar, but it seems it'll be far more stable than the bitcoin will be in the foreseeable future, possibly ever.and my last point is something i've wondered since i first even heard of bitcoin. regular government-appointed currencies like the us dollar are already pretty much digital anyway, since people buy things online and know how to send payments digitally and load them on their paypal account or send them through online venders like square cash, venmo, chase quickpay etc. so isn't that way too hard for cryptocurrencies to compete with, since that is far too mainstream and established and people trust it too much already?yes i'm aware of the benefits crypto has over regular currencies like usd, but as it stands now, those benefits seem to be outweighed by its volatility that make its intended purpose far less lucrative. again, please don't interpret this as hating on bitcoin, but merely an attempt to understand it. i just don't see that many people treating it as anything other than a stock, which is not at all the same thing as a currency. feel free to change my mind. we just pierced support at 10,000 how y'all out here selling at such piss poor prices? huurdurr paper-handed weak-sauce fools are driving the price down with this garbage. get out of here with that mess. [removed] i was wondering if there are any apps that notify you when there's a significant price dip? so if i lost keys to my wallets there isnt a way to get it back right? ### market wrap: bitcoin falls to $11.1k; ethereum miners at record fee percentage hey all.  looking for some way to get my transactions out of the mempool and on their way to where i'd sent them.  i (stupidly) set the fee to the lowest setting 0.0000025(ish) using mycelium to move funds from paper wallets to binance and have been waiting the better part of 15(ish) hours and still no confirmations on any.  wondering a) how long i might be waiting from here, and b) what the best "replace by fee" option might be .  thoughts (aside from 'dont use such low fees' because obviously) i was reading about bitcoin, but not as much as i should have, i know there will only be 21 million bitcoin produced, how is that a good thing because many people owning bitcoin will start dying (loosing their wallet) there will be millions of bitcoin in wallets of diseased people by 2040.how is that something good ?

i'm kind of shocked. so ive been having a lot of friends start to text me asking if its a good time to invest in bitcoin. i want them to understand it before just throwing money in. whats the single best video or article you would send them? links appreciated. the legacy financial institutions would love to have you believe that bitcoin is correlated to the overall performance of the stock market. but when pondering that possibility even for a moment you can see that their arguments fail to add up in any logical context.  the reason is pretty simple really. it's because when you understand the fact that bitcoin was created was as an alternative to the existing financial institution, and that vast majority of folks who are buying bitcoin are ideologically aligned with preserving their own financial autonomy and voting against the existing corrupt system. with that said and when considering that supply and demand determines value coupled with the fact that this is the world's truly first finite asset, you can see that this is just a elaborate ruze.  especially when you see that the vast majority of bitcoin haven't moved on the blockchain.in the short to medium-term i expect the banks will continue to try and manipulate the usd price of btc to perpetuate the narrative that bitcoin is correlated to the stock market performance. they will do so via a process they have done for the last few years involving  their over-the-counter exchanges, cash settled futures, and  their control of the bitcoin exchanges involving rehypothification and commingling. they do this out of their desperation to perpetuate their relavency but in the end i'm betting that they can't beat math.as for myself i will be continuing to dollar cost average buy and buy aggressively on the dips while hodling my own keys. not because of the potential short-term dollar appreciation, but because of my vote in the system of true freedom away from the corrupt fiat system that we are all subjects to. i do so because i believe that more and more people will decide to vote for bitcoin and join the dollar cost averaging hodl freedom fighters and that together we can and will change the world for the better for all (except the banksters). the old local bitcoins was private. atms in other countries are private. i see alot of folks point to bisq, a truly p2p exchange. but the fiat options are mostly reliant on conventional banking. today it seems buying on bisq is not and cannot be private in practice. there is a face to face option but not many offers there.https://docs.bisq.network/payment-methodsbuying gold locally or marijuana in a state where it's legal is more private. btc seems more comparable to purchasing firearms than anything else.complaints aside, what is the most private payment method on bisq, if any?thanks i wanted to test out mixing on whirlpool, but after the first cycle and getting chosen for the second one, it just seems to be stuck on "joined a mix". for some reason it sometimes disappears in whirlpool and then after refreshing comes back. it has been like that for about \~20 hours. it also looses it's tags (1/5 mix, mixing) in the unspend outputs tab and they eventually come back... am i doing something wrong? from my understanding you only have to keep the application running when you want it chosen for a mix.thanks in advance! go beyond qe infinity and print the planet into another dimension. bitcoin should hit $12k again once we're in this new dimension. soon, the entire atomic structure of the universe will be replaced with fiat money and bitcoin will break its ath of $20k.

[removed] [removed] so bitcoin just got modified today. an sjw changed the word "blacklist" to "blocklist" because the idiot got offended by it. they tried to revert it but it got cancelled.how long before the sjw decide to modify the 21 million cap to 80 million so that even the poor of the world can have some bitcoin?yes this is a tiny change indeed, but in this case peter schiff is right. nobody can change gold, whereas a nobody just changed a tiny part of bitcoin.

[removed] **bitcoin** has been a heavy financial blow to the trading world since it rose to significance. the flickering uncertainty of the traditional economy, entirely controlled by the government has caused several disastrous events in the past. but bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies in the world are completely free from government and political influence, which dont lose its value over a political takeover.india has also witnessed the rise of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in some events. you may remember the demonetization and the aftermath of it. here in india, we saw a spike of bitcoin users around that time but the sudden ban imposed by the rbi made it all gone. now that after two years the supreme court has overruled the decision of rbi, the indian cryptocurrency market is slowly rising from ashes.but the question remains, about bitcoin legality in india if legal then does it have a framework and regulations passed by the government?before we find answers to these questions, lets look back at the beginning.## the beginningstarted in 2009, bitcoin first rose to global significance in the year 2017. it was the first time for bitcoin to cross the $1000 mark but it didnt stop there.then came a blow from the chinese government when the peoples bank of china decided to tighten its grip on the cryptocurrency market. as a result, the graph went down by 30%, however, it successfully maintained its steady growth. around may, it had jumped well over $2000.it was december 17, the crypto exchange recorded its highest value of all time as the bitcoin value was standing on the number $19,783.21.but the market subsequently came down and nowadays it roams around the $10,000 mark.## india banned cryptocurrency in 2018surprisingly when the world was facing a crypto bull market race, indian backed down from the idea and the reserve bank of india imposed a de facto ban on the trading of crypto.the rbi assessed that there were multiple risks involved in dealing with crypto and should be immediately banned to trade it. as a result, the huge market that was yet to understand its potential was dismissed.many people and respective associations spoke against it and the internet &amp; mobile association of india went to the supreme court against the rbis decision.at that point, india had around 5 million cryptocurrency users, who were actively trading and using bitcoin as a currency. but all of a sudden it all shut down, as the users were left with the option to either hold on to their bitcoin savings or trade through the foreign.but since supreme court took the matter in hand the situation began to change. unlike rbi, sc had a wider view on the matter and asked about the reasons of the bitcoin trade ban.while there wasnt any satisfactory answers from the rbi, the supreme court lifted the ban on the use of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in 2020.it seems like, with the ban lifted, india is currently free to deal or trade in bitcoins without any barriers. but it isnt that easy.## bitcoin legality in india&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/t5bxt1cnlgl51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b4d014c65e4a8bb3e787531b7654eb37d736994# now having covered all the backstories, lets take a look at the main question of this article.# can you trade bitcoins now?# the answer is- yes. trading or dealing with bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency like ethereum is legal in india. you can trade, buy, and sell bitcoins from domestic or foreign exchanges and even invest in them.startups like wazirx, lastbit, zebpay, and international companies like paxful are providing platforms to market crypto as the optional currency. ceos of these companies are hopeful for the near future as india is counted among the five countries to have the most bitcoin users.but there are some problems yet unresolved.crypto mining. though the sc lifted the ban from crypto trading, crypto mining is still impossible in india. mining is a work that requires specific technologies and a high supply of electricity. while the latter is a problem in india, the former is the bigger challenge. because the machine to mine bitcoins, asic is still illegal to import.asic standing for application-specific integrated circuit is the most advanced technology to mine bitcoin profitably. when the crypto was banned, importing asic was also banned. so, now the miners are left with nothing useful other than gpu technology to mine. while gpu was useful 10 years ago, today it simply doesnt work.its also unlikely to manufacture asic in india, because it only works for the purpose of crypto mining only. as long as theres no stable market here, manufacturers wouldnt take the risk to produce it here.so, the conclusion on bitcoin legality in india can be to trade crypto but not mine it. we think its still a fair opportunity to get the indian crypto market a bit more stability and then the government might reconsider their stand on crypto mining.source - [how to buy bitcoin in india](https://buybitcoinhow2020.com/) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] welcome to the daily discussion. please read the disclaimer, guidelines, and rules before participating.***-**disclaimer:**though karma rules still apply, moderation is less stringent on this thread than on the rest of the sub. therefore, consider all information posted here with several liberal heaps of salt, and always cross check any information you may read on this thread with known sources. any trade information posted in this open thread may be highly misleading, and could be an attempt to manipulate new readers by known "pump and dump (pnd) groups" for their own profit. beware of such practices and exercise utmost caution before acting on any trade tip mentioned here.***-**rules:*** all [sub rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/about/rules/) apply in this thread. the prior exemption for karma and age requirements is no longer in effect.* discussion topics must be related to cryptocurrency.* comments will be sorted by newest first.***-**to see prior skeptics discussions, [click here](https://old.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/search?q=title%3a%22monthly+skeptics+discussion%22+&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).** [removed] i was doing some research and wanted to ask the community if they had any infographics on the technical/business architecture required to allow staking? any information on this subject would work, such as research papers or whitepapers with clear technicals;

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] hi! i am looking for my first hardware crypto wallet. but wich one should i buy?i mostly trade/use btc, eth, ltc, and chainlink.i am completely new to this. what are some things to keep in mind?thanks in advance! [removed] i had my 24 mnemonic seed phrase written down for about a year before i decided to have a go at memorizing it. once i had it memorized, i don't know why i hadn't thought of doing it sooner. it didn't take me long to remember (i practiced reciting 6 words at a time. it took me under a week to be able to recite the whole 24 words with confidence, and now i rectite them silently to myself on a weekly basis. and that's coming from someone who hasn't even bothered to learn my own phone number, and i'm always forgetting my postcode!) i've got to say it gives me so much peace of mind knowing that i have a mental back-up to my physical copy.i know that relying **solely** on your memory isn't a good practice, so i want to be clear i'm talking about using your memory as an **extra** backup.some people will say if you have a physical copy of your seed secured properly, then memorizing it isn't necessary. but surely having an **extra backup** (in **addition** to your physical copy) in your head is only a good thing? (well, unless you talk a lot in your sleep). for example, i remember reading here recently about someone who was unable to access their funds after being stuck abroad longer than he planned due to covid. the same thing has happened to a friend of mine. he has his ledger, but after an update to the firmware he needed to restore his wallet but didn't have his seed with him, meaning he still can't access his crypto (his copy of his seed is still in his condo and he's been away a few months and is a bit anxious about it, even though it's well hidden). having your seed memorized means it's with you wherever you go, ready in case of any unexpected emergency (especially good for people who travel a lot), and i find that kind of liberating.so i'm curious, how many of you have memorized your seed? and if you haven't done so yet, i'd like to encourage you to give it a go! if grandma can, anyone can.

UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// coinrule is this awesome trading website that i see little mention about. it's great for beginners and experts alike. you link your exchange and then either set your rules that you make your self or use one of their many templates. i know i sound like a shill but after doing my own do diligence to find what i was looking for in an easy to use, programmable trading bot coinrule was perfect. i'm not going to include the links because it pretty easy to find on your own. i just hope that if trading is something you're interested in that you will check it out. i've included some [screen shots](https://imgur.com/a/e2hwqiw) to give you a brief idea. i assure you i am in no way affiliated with them at all. plus if you select the nano x instead of the nano s, you won't pay for postage saving you even more.the net effect is you only pay about 15% more for the superior nano x.code: **backtoschool**ps: i've deliberately not included a link as you should never follow any purchase links on reddit (or anywhere else for that matter).  please only buy from an authorised ledger outlet.i only ever purchase direct for peace of mind. hello i need to buy a small amount of bitcoin ($60) worth and send it to an address and i was wondering what the simplest way to do that is. i tried xcoin but it takes fucking forever because they ask you to send a picture of your face with your id and write down xcoin and the date on a piece of paper. and i did that and even included my student i.d. for university for added proof but every time i try to verify they need a utility bill for proof but i don't pay bills. they never get back to my help requests so i need another platform that will let me pay with a credit card and just send the bitcoin without dealing with a 3rd party wallet and all of that. thank you! &amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/oxlojeg4eul51.png?width=1903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8da1ed9b435edad208dd682a1d58a16a1fb4ca79 three years before i bought bitcoin for $45 when it was sold for $0.06 each it was something around 745 coins ig  it was a period where people kept on debating bitcoin is just waste of investment and will never succeed, i was just hoping to make another $50 profit in couple of days but my dumbass friend kept on telling me u just wasted 45 bucks and called me dumb for buying useless and crashing coins, dumbass me didn't wanna loose my 45 so just sold the coins on the same eve, and in a couple of days i regret doing it cuz could've made thousands of dollars in profit, i just didn't see it for a while but when i heard bitcoin boom after 8 months it hit all time high of 19k mark , i started regretting my life dang it i could've been a millionaire now dumbass me wish i can change the past. if you you made the same mistake comment down and let me know lets join dumbass gang lol what kind of set up do you use for mining? is bitcoin mining still worth it? i am a noob on this. any insights are greatly appreciated. so i saw winklevi on barstool sports and realized, i like them better than zuckerberg. for years i thought zuck was so cool and winklevi were kind of dopes.but then i saw them on barstool sports with that fellow from the bronx or whatever, and was like damn, look at these mega rich dude who control a material percent of the worlds bitcoin, helping some influencer make a dumb trade for a youtube audience. thats legendary.you know? zuck wouldnt show up for that. he wouldnt even pick up the phone. maybe hed send his cat (cause zuck is def not a dog guy. you know hes got some weird hairless breed or some shit.)so my point is, i guess winklevi are cool. i pretty much only use gemini anyway and its great. and american. has anyone tried coinods.com? i am a freelancer and the company that hired me only uses coinods.com for transactions. is there any way i can transfer my bitcoin to paypal from coinods.com?please help. i would really appreciate it. thank you i keep seeing comments on youtube of experts you can contact via what'sapp. i'm worried about their success rate though, anyone have legit references? i was thinking of getting into trading, and then using those profits to get btc for long term holding. or are we watching our demise?satoshi poetry [removed] i know i sound like a karen right now, but one week? is there any app that i can use to buy/send bitcoins that does not take nearly as long?? is tor havin a hiccup? stats @ https://bitnodes.io/dashboard/?days=90 this has been driving me insane for a while now. around 2011 - 2015 i was into bitcoin and i'm almost positive that i have a few still somewhere, the issue is that i don't remember where they are stored. i want to find them but i'm not sure how to start, at the time i was also using fake throwaway email accounts so it's not traceable by my personal email. i might be able to remember the usernames and passwords for the wallets but i'm just not sure what they were. what were the popular wallets back then and is there any hope for me or am i totally screwed? so i have one mnemonic phrase and one passphrase (6 words chosen with dice so pretty damn hard to crack). i have one copy of the mnemonic at my moms place and metal copies of the mnemonic and passphrase at home. i have a cellar space thing which is only separated from neighboring spaces with some spaced wood. someone could easily get in there if he wanted to. the locks are old af so very easy to pick.i know that i should separate the two parts but i feel weird having my mnemonic down there. i also feel weird having both parts in the same place. in my appartment. because if someone gets in there (which would be harder but still possible) he could find both parts at once. the third option would be to give out more copies of the mnemonic to other family members and only keep the passphrase at my place but i feel even less comfortable with that.should i just keep my mnemonic phrases down in the cellar because i have a copy at my moms anyway? it's already kind of corrupted and not in my hands anymore what is going to happen to that. not that my mom would try to steal anything. part of the money on there belongs to her aswell. i'm just generally trying to figure out what best practice would look like in my position. did the wallet seed ever resemble this format?asdfg-asdfg-asdfg-asdfg-asdfg [removed] [removed] what triggers me is that many of the sub content essentially turned into a circle jerk posts. the typical "gentle reminder" kind of stuff. rather than keep talking about the deflationary economics of bitcoin and basically keep "reminding" others to buy and hold why don't we try to keep the forum to discuss the recent development of bitcoin and some more general talks on bitcoin.at the  we want bitcoin to have its own niche in human life and economy because token without utility is as good as nothing. we want people to be invested in bitcoin because of its "value" cos if you keep "pumping" bitcoin you are not actually invested in the idea of bitcoin but rather on the fiat equivalent value of the bitcoin. &amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/9agp3spdsrl51.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07d3f375aedae0b800ffade0d70fff7b2c3f95de [removed] seriously though, it's totally f'd that they're going after julian assange for being a journalist and whistleblower. he's basically trying to make the same point that a lot of us are trying to make as well. get informed: [defend.wikileaks.org](https://defend.wikileaks.org) [removed] up? down? your thoughts? if i'm trying to mine bitcoins, which is something i get the gist of (programmatically) where exactly is the "cave"?? like isn't there an official api from which i check and acquire my coins?thanks in advance! so im new to the whole bitcoin stuff and ive been researching it and it seems to be easily traceable. should i be worried about using bitcoin to get a personal amount of a certain something to my house? would i just get a letter from the post office that there was drugs in my package and that be that? is there a way to be more private? or does it even really matter and i should just order what i want. i'm sure that in the long term we'll no more compare 1 btc to usd, like here in italy we no long compare euros to lira, like my parents did when they adopted the new currency; but still:when all bitcoin will be mined; the demand (with the global population) will increase; so the value of this asset, in the long term, will always go up because of it's fixed quantity.for time-&gt; infinity, then btc-&gt;infity usddoes this make sense?

just a random showerthough, not a serious argumentif the destruction/loss of private keys renders the bitcoins attached to those keys unusable and the amount of bitcoin is finite and we assume that private key loss events happen randomly but consistently over time, is the long term conclusion that all bitcoin will be frozen? disclaimer: i'm not a certified financial advisor. you should not take this as an financial advice. please make your own due diligence by doing your own research before making any investment.history has shown in any major economic crisis, there are 5 stages that will happen leading to the apocalypse (hyperinflation).stage 1 -  steady inflationstage 2 - deep deflationstage 3 -  higher inflationstage 4 - deeper deflationstage 5 - hyperinflationso we have completed stage 1&amp;2 this year and we are currently at stage 3, and slowly moving to stage 4so, my prediction is we could to stage 4 (deeper deflation) if the government didn't release the second stimulus package which is against the federal reserve target of 2% inflation.  but, from what i'm reading on the news the second stimulus package might be released end of september if agreed by the government which will drive bitcoin price up and cause us to be in stage 3 for a little bit longer until end of this year.start the year 2021, we might face the inevitable stage 4 (the deeper deflation), btc price will drop hard worse than this week because the  real economy isn't going back to normal, no jobs, no food and no shelter. people will start to liquidate btc assets to support their daily life needs and they will cut their spending because free money from government has stoppedand by 2021, the deflation had become so bad the government had to make the old money printer once again go brrrrrrrrr to stop the economy from collapsing. and that my fellow hodlers, will be the start of the stage 5 (hyperinflation).when hyperinflation happen, the one who hold real money gold, silver and bitcoin and hard producing assets will be safe. the one who don't will be wiped out.are ready to ride this roller coaster? are you ready to be launched to andromeda galaxy? [removed] ok, so i may sound like a complete idiot asking this, and i probably am, but i am having issues day trading on bybit because of fees. i don't have a ton of money invested yet because i'm just starting out and trying to learn the ropes a bit. i made 3 trades so far. the first trade i attempted was with $100, the second was with $230, and the third was $500. i used 2x, 3x, and 5x leverage respectively because i know the funds i'm starting with are rather low, and i was fine with the monetary risk involved when dealing with these lower numbers. it seems like bybit charged me $8, $16, and $32 for the trades respectively. these trades would have been somewhat profitable, but not nearly enough to offset the fees. after the first two, i tried looking into why the fees were so high, and noticed i was doing market trades instead of limit trades which have different fee models. so i switched to limit trades, enabled the post only feature to ensure my limit order was a maker, which should mean i earn a 0.025% rebate according to bybit... yet doing all this, my final trade cost me $32 in fees. at one point i nearly took the profits at +$20, but it still wasn't worth it at a -$10 loss... im clearly missing something. someone please explain what i'm doing wrong. i am looking for a wallet that will let me select between different receiving public addresses. electrum used to allow me to do this but the app is no longer working for me. it even let me choose between "all", "unused", "funded", and "used" addresses.

[removed] the more i do research on cryptocurrency the more skeptical i am about the long term prospects of cryptocurrencymy skepticism with the current state of cryptocurrency, stems from my belief that governments will never allow any of the current cryptocurrency to become a generally accepted form of currency within their country. this is simply because of politics. cryptocurrency removes the need for a centralized bank and that is a radical idea to modern politicians. i just dont see such a radical change to the economic model happening within our lifetimes.i also find it hard to believe that a government will trust a cryptocurrency that was developed by an third party rather than highly regulated state sponsored developers.dont get me wrong, i do believe in the technology that is being introduced, however i believe the most likely scenario where crypto succeeds is when a government makes a concerted effort to create their own highly regulated cryptocurrency and so in that scenario, none of the current cryptocurrency available will survive in the long run.please change my mind. welcome to the daily discussion. please read the disclaimer, guidelines, and rules before participating.***-**disclaimer:**though karma rules still apply, moderation is less stringent on this thread than on the rest of the sub. therefore, consider all information posted here with several liberal heaps of salt, and always cross check any information you may read on this thread with known sources. any trade information posted in this open thread may be highly misleading, and could be an attempt to manipulate new readers by known "pump and dump (pnd) groups" for their own profit. beware of such practices and exercise utmost caution before acting on any trade tip mentioned here.***-**rules:*** all [sub rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/about/rules/) apply in this thread. the prior exemption for karma and age requirements is no longer in effect.* discussion topics must be related to cryptocurrency.* comments will be sorted by newest first.***-**to see prior skeptics discussions, [click here](https://old.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/search?q=title%3a%22monthly+skeptics+discussion%22+&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).** [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] "just wait for the pump on the chinese new year""stock to flow model puts btc 100,000 usd next year""all cme gaps must be filled""buy back after tax season"all of these narratives are bullshit and have almost no impact on the market at all. the reality is bitcoin no longer can organically grow by funds from the crypto community because of the introduction of futures markets, leverage trading, and institutional investors. and because cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value, it's hard for professional investors to decide how to value bitcoin during times of volatility in traditional markets. is bitcoin a tech stock, a risk asset, safe haven, gold? institutions have no clue how to classify bitcoin. that's why we are seeing bitcoin acting so reactive to global markets. bitcoin is dumping not because of the cme gap, but because professional traders are taking profits on tech stocks and they are thinking bitcoin is in that category. i have been into the project travala.com since the very beginning, at that time it was called concierge.i got all my tokens for free from a neo airdrop in 2018 by thousands as i made many wallets on purpose.next i bought company shares by thousands too which to be honest, are very shady as no news are given regarding this investment.i was in all telegram chats related to them, i was pretty active but not a brain dead sheep like 99% of the community, and this is what made me banned from this community completely biased and blinded by their moderators acting like crazy gurus, telling them to buy all the time no matter what the price is, and potentially putting some of them in financial difficulties as they just keep believing whatever will be said by those crazy mods.i got banned because i was telling people to be careful as the price was clearly going to drop drastically, it went from 0.08cts to 2.50$ within three months and i made huge profits with this tbh.once i told in the chat about the facts that i sold waiting for the dip, i was being insulted and also received dms from the mods as i was spreading fud they said. i was just being realistic and they didnt like it.its a very toxic community and most of the token at held by few people, some having hundreds of thousands of coins on a 40m of supplies only and they literally control the market much more than whales control bitcoins.they remind me the xrp army or bsv fans shitting on your face whenever you say something that doesnt sound good to them.hello to james and paul from the chat who pulled out early and believed me regarding selling when i said to do so. they saved more than 60% loss. to bad for the rest who didnt want to listen and keep sucking their masters on the chat.

[removed] i've been thinking about this for a while now.price is created by supply and demand... someone has to sell, and there needs to be buyers. more buyers than sellers equal greater demand therefore increase in price... i understand this.currently there is talk that the number of hodlers are increasing.... so that means less and less bitcoin is being traded... also i understand that miners are bringing btc to market to sell to cover costs, but due to halving this amount decreases every 210,000 blocks/approximately 4 years.so in theory, as more holders come to btc...less btc comes to market... price goes up.here's what i need to understand...as holders keep holding, and buying dips....they currently are subject to the traders...even if 20.5 million btc are mined... and 20 million btc are held.... it is that .5 million that is being traded, that controls the price...so as more and more btc is taken out of circulation, less and less is being traded....it is this small amount traded controlling price...let's say btc stays at a range of $8500- 12k for 10 years.... this is possible if people slowly take btc off the market... which is probably happening now.unless huge amounts of people flock to btc in a short amount of time, and all the available btc brought to market sells asap.... there is no way we can reach highs of $100,000.if we continue at our current pace of growth...spread over years... it is most probable that for the next few years, possibly until next halving, we may stay in a range of 4k- 14k...please school me. hello,i have a sipp, i'm unable to find a provider who allows me to invest my sipp into a blockchain fund/crypto fund.can anyone assist? i'm currently with aj bell youinvest and they have no options for crypto/blockchain but it's where i want to invest.your help will be greatly appreciated. i don't have enough to approach an advisor so i'm left to do my own work. great. so today was my first day to purchase $100 of bitcoin using shakepay. my intention is to buy $100 worth of bitcoin every month (im 19yr old so a bit tight on budget) for the next 20 years. i am also not willing to trade bitcoin, will just hold onto then pretty much forever. do you guys recommened buying a hardware wallet? or what kind of wallet should i store my bitcoin? i know im not supposed to store my bitcoin in the shakepay app, but im pretty lost here..

500:im also tracking the s&amp;p 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with more traditional markets. even with everything thats going on in the world, the s&amp;p continues adding

be worth $1,400 had it been redirected to the s&amp;p 500 in january 2019.the 2019 top ten portfolio is returning +83% over last 20 months, over double the roi of the s&amp;p 500 over the same time period.but what if i took the same worlds-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging/$1,000-per-year-on-january-1st approach with the s&amp;p 500? it would yield the following:* $1000 investment in s&amp;p 500 on

a similar approach with the s&amp;p:**after three $1,000 investments into an s&amp;p 500 index fund in january 2018, 2019, and 2020, my portfolio would be worth $3,800.**that is up over**+27%** [since january 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/), compared to a**+31%**gain of the combined top ten crypto experiment portfolios.as you can see in the table below,

conclusion:thanks to a strong couple of months, the 2019 top ten portfolio is doing just as well as the 2020 top ten group, both of which are far, far ahead of the 2018 top ten. meanwhile, despite the presence of a global pandemic and all the uncertainty associated with an election year, the us stock markets reached all time highs in august. as we approach the fall, im buckling up for an

[removed] i think most of you already know this, but crypto has really been a life saver for middle class nigerians, especially us that have to deal with a central bank that has made sourcing dollars hard to find because crude oil has wrecked us and they refuse to open up the economy..&amp;#x200b;this reuters article best explains it:"odunjo sources handsets and accessories from china and the united arab emirates. his chinese suppliers asked to be paid in the cryptocurrency, he said, for speed and convenience.the shift has boosted his profits, as he no longer has to buy dollars using the nigerian naira or shell out fees to money-transfer firms. it is also one example of how, in africa, bitcoin - the original and biggest cryptocurrency - is finding the practical use that it has largely failed to elsewhere.bitcoin helped to protect my business against the currency devaluation, and enabled me to grow at the same time, odunjo told reuters from his two-by-eight metre shop.you dont have to pay charges, you dont have to buy dollars, the 30-year-old said, raising his voice above the sound of loud haggling and the honking horns of scooters.odunjo is one of many people at the heart of a quiet bitcoin boom in africa, driven by payments from small businesses as well as remittances sent home from migrant workers, according to data shared exclusively with reuters and interviews with around 20 bitcoin users and five cryptocurrency exchanges.monthly cryptocurrency transfers to and from africa of under $10,000 - typically made by individuals and small businesses - jumped more than 55% in a year to reach $316 million in june, the data from u.s. blockchain research firm chainalysis shows."[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-africa-insight/how-bitcoin-met-the-real-world-in-africa-iduskbn25z0q8](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-africa-insight/how-bitcoin-met-the-real-world-in-africa-iduskbn25z0q8)&amp;#x200b;we save in tether and do business in bitcoin, cuts of extractive policies that would have left us at the mercy of the central bank 10 years ago.. my bank(which i was thinking about leaving for a while now and just broke the barrier now), pko bp in poland just sent me a push notification, first one since i joined few years ago not about a transaction or sth like that, saying:virtual currencies - what to watch out for?virtual currency is not money!x fucking d, they scared, probably got shorts too the fucking assholes, roflmao. peter schiff sells different gold investments and only talks about cryptocurrency because the attention it brings him. he uses a fear-base strategy to sell these investments and earn money under the thesis that "it's all coming down" in that there will be a sweeping collapse of banks worldwide, and this allows him to earn money off the investments he sells when he can convince people that the different gold investments he sells is the only way to secure your wealth and all else will be worthless when the sky starts falling. i don't expect much people to care but seeing him constantly posted on here just thought some people should be aware at the very least. this guy is absolutely manipulating and fear-mongering to make money off investments he sells and it works literally every single time [removed] [removed] i would like to use a crypto currency in my "classroom economy" for grade 7 students. mostly used for buying craft materials. could someone recommend a crypto to start with?- i'm okay using an honor system to govern "only get coins from each other and me". so that kids can't just buy coins and imbalance the system using their personal wealth.- i'll buy the initial set of coins with my own teachers salary. it'd be nice if it was under $50.- 150 students, 50-1000 transactions per day estimated.- kids have access to shared computers in the room. outside of class, varies but everyone ultimately has some access (because of covid...)- it would be nice if they could create their own accounts, without id.- if they lose their money, it's lost!can anyone recommend which crypto i could use to get started with everything?

[removed] can anyone share their experience with a safepal hardware wallet so far? just purchased my first trezor &amp; i'm planning on moving the precious coin over to it. basically i'm just bragging and insisting you do the same if you haven't already.not your keys not your coins!! [removed] this article will help you to determine and to understand the core principles. i'm so thankful that status publish this kind of article that helps thousands to millions of people. that we have to raise our voice and to adopt blockchain technology and to stop the data collection and surveillance.one of the principal sources of the omnipresent data collection and surveillance we see today lies in the inherently secretive and centralized development of most applications. if you have a system in which the users do not know and cannot easily verify what is being tracked and stored, there is little to no incentive to actually care about privacy. now, in many cases there will be genuine, well- meaning people leading the charge in a companys infancy, but this goodwill is often short lived. the final outcome of profits over people seems almost inevitable in the tech industry, and this is exactly the problem status is trying to address.this simple idea ties into several of our [**core principles**](https://status.im/about/). first and foremost, transparency and openness. all of our source code is public, and our development process is very accessible and transparent. every other week, there is a town hall discussion covering all important changes at status such as hiring, core development plans, infrastructure and more. our research, planning and brainstorming is all accessible on our [**discuss forum**](https://our.status.im/stop-trusting-companies-start-trusting-code/discuss%20forum), in which users are encouraged to participate. anyone is free to follow along, and contribute, within the inner workings of our development process. there are no hidden updates, no secret trackers, and no unwanted data collection.for more details please check: [https://our.status.im/stop-trusting-companies-start-trusting-code/](https://our.status.im/stop-trusting-companies-start-trusting-code/) i'm not gonna lie i probably could've done some homework but maybe some of you guys can source me some good reads or provide some insight.anyway, my uncle died several months ago and he had invested in bitcoins. his brother was able to gain access to his wallet and he plans to divide it equally amongst the other brothers and sisters. my dad told my sister and i he would share some of the currency with us and we could either cash it out or take the coins. i'm curious how all this works though, can bitcoin (or even the money) be taxed on either a state or federal level? or what happens on my end if i take the coins into my wallet and cash it out afterward?tbh, i'm not even sure where to begin with what information i need to seek out as i'm not the one inheriting anything, just being given i guess. ive heard from several people that i know, and a lot of youtubers. that we are in for a double dip stock market crash, what do you guys think will happen to the price of btc? will it go up? will it go down? will we see bitcoin below 7k again? i just set up a wallet and they ask for all the same info that a fucking brokerage would. what is the fucking point of crypto if it's just some extension of the god damned federal reserve?before crypto was an escape to the people that control currencies/inflation, now it just looks like it's the centralization of all currencies, and will replace all other countries currencies for easier manipulation. [removed] i have to questions that i'm hoping the smarter more experienced bitcoin gurus can address.1. the foundation for bitcoin (cryptocurrency) is the idea of decentralization. my question is this: are the "forks" that have happened in bitcoin only possible due to centralization (a centralized group of programmers; "community"?2. next question: what are the possible legal ramifications in regards to bitcoin originally being created for, and being circulated on the darknet for nefarious purposes. could bitcoin be targeted as a criminal organization or tool in anyway? everybody i've ever heard talk about satoshi's bitcoins just kind of glosses over it like it's no big deal. but whoever created bitcoin is obviously someone to whom money has little meaning. this person or persons has resisted the temptation to take profits for almost a decade now.am i the only one who finds that just a little bit terrifying? [removed] [removed] i guess im confused as i thought the keys were stored only on the device-is the actual key on the device different than the public key that you verify and give out to receive coin? so i heard ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency that exist. i am planning to accumulate bitcoin throught the next decade, but i was wondering if there are also a lot of people bullish about ethereum, and if that is true, i just want to hear about the reasons why they are bullish. (also possibly why people dont recommend buying it) i got $6 back. i tend to not be the most articulate individual and would love for some people to give me ways to explain to my father why bitcoin is the future. i have a btc transaction, it's funds released from bitrated escrow service back to my exchange btc address.i don't remember having the option to set the mining fees when i accept the release of funds on bitrated.  so i think the bitrated website set the mining fees for fee, and it's set the fees at  **4.365 sat/b**and now the transaction is stuck there for 5, 6 hours? anyway to speed it up? the title pretty much says it all is one else having trouble buying bitcoin from coinbase with chime bank? this all started about a couple weeks ago use to never have a problem. i contacted customer support but i don't think they even knew what i was talking about and said they don't support buying bitcoin or "coin bases" lol. hey guys,i just updated the firmware on my ledger nano x to install the vechain app. and when it completed, all my apps was gone. i installed them again and now only vechain is appearing. i am restarting both the ledger live app and the device but it's not appearing.any one encountered this? they had 18 btc. does this sound credible ? i purchased a ledger x but im not exactly sure why. lol. i use electrum but i jumped on the boat and got a hard wallet. i just find it cumbersome to use. am i missing out on something? right now, bitcoin is traded much more as a speculative asset (buy for increasing fiat value) and not as much as a currency (traded for everyday things or hours). deflation is bad for fiat economies because it means that people are not buying things and stimulating the economy. obliviously, the more bitcoin that are mined the less volatile this asset will be but as long as it is expected to increase in relative fiat value, people will not spend bitcoin and it will remain in the same area as other income producing assets.disclaimer: i do own bitcoin, hold an economics degree (college is a joke though) and have disposable stable income. i bought some bitcoin way back in april 2013 but cant figure out how to obtain them. i have a confirmation email from bitinstant showing my order number. i also have an email from coinapult telling me i had a bitinstant deposit via coinapult. it seems like the site coinapult is working but bitinstant has been down for at least five years. can i get this bitcoin back or is it gone forever? easiest wallet to use to buy bitcoin from bitcoin atm then transfer the coin to somebody elses wallet. i really love the bitcoin technology  do you ?i know bitcoin since 2014 how about you ?i just made 0.005 profit at satoshihill &lt;3&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/lhm7mdl4z5m51.png?width=1104&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aef47ceed926aade44dd3623340de1e4491c7057https://preview.redd.it/6qqx8ll4z5m51.jpg?width=956&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=066f6be3a676c8ec40eeb01be4016b514ce7c946https://preview.redd.it/od78ekl4z5m51.jpg?width=405&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff6a11ee21cf0ae3b297c1ab7251a5092658208f or would that just be brute forced if someone who knew how got a hold of it? how many words would you need to memorize if thats the case. how do you maintain your anonymity and also how do you ensure you don't get ripped off after sending the ach payment? remember when a house cost $2,000 and a share of microsft cost $0.50. our grandparents had it so easy and in the process of them getting rich, our current generation is stuck with no money and can afford nothing.&amp;#x200b;our grandchildren will be birthed into a world were they will only earn a lifetime salary of 0.0001 bitcoin (equavlant of about $999 trillion usd.) join celsius network using my referral code 108599d00e when signing up and earn $20 in btc with your first deposit of $200 or more! #unbankyourselfhttps://celsiusnetwork.app.link/108599d00e join celsius network using my referral code 108599d00e when signing up and earn $20 in btc with your first deposit of $200 or more! #unbankyourselfhttps://celsiusnetwork.app.link/108599d00e instead of a utility sending electricity to a certain city to power homes, perhaps it makes more sense for the utility to spend the electricity on bitcoin and pay for electricity in the future to power the homes.these are the kinds of thought exercises that will become more prominent in the bitcoin space in the years ahead.

dr. gavin wood, co-founder of ethereum and inventor of solidity, left to begin work on polkadot, a next generation scalable blockchain protocol that connects multiple specialised blockchains into one unified network. it achieves scalability through a sharding infrastructure with multiple blockchains running in parallel, called parachains, that connect to a central chain called the relay chain.whilst it shares some similarities with ethereum 2.0, one key differentiator is that it uses heterogeneous sharding, where each parachains can be customised through the substrate development framework, enabling them to be optimised for a specific use case and running in parallel rather than same across all shards. this is important as when it comes to blockchain architecture, one size does not fit all and all blockchains make trade-offs to support different features and use cases.all parachains connect to the relay chain, which validates the state transition of connected parachains, providing shared state across the entire ecosystem. if the relay chain must revert for any reason, then all of the parachains would also revert. this is to ensure that the validity of the entire system can persist, and no individual part is corruptible. the shared state makes it so that the trust assumptions when using parachains are only those of the relay chain validator set, and no other. since the validator set on the relay chain is expected to be secure with a large amount of stake put up to back it, it is desirable for parachains to benefit from this security.this enables seamless interoperability between all parachains and parathreads using the cross-chain message passing (xcmp) protocol, allowing arbitrary data  not just tokens  to be transferred across blockchains. interoperability is also possible to other ecosystems through bridges, which are specifically designed parachains or parathreads that are custom made to interact with another ecosystem such as ethereum, bitcoin and cosmos for example, enabling interoperability. because these other ecosystems dont use the same shared state of polkadot, finality is incredibly important, because whilst the relay chain can roll back all the parachains, it cant roll back the ethereum or bitcoin blockchains for example. this is discussed further in [part three](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/polkadot-an-early-in-depth-analysis-part-three-limitations-and-issues-d8b0a795a3e).https://preview.redd.it/lmrz428je6m51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=237ad499f85e960ca50ca884234453ce283a60c0the relay chain is responsible for the networks shared security, consensus and cross-chain interoperability. it is secured by validators and nominators staking the native dot tokens. ultimately scalability for the ecosystem is determined by how scalable the relay chain can be. the number of parachains is determined by the number of validators on the relay chain. the hope is to reach 1000 validators, which would enable around 100 parachains. with each parachain being capable of around 1,000 transactions per second.nominators stake their dot tokens with validators they trust, with the validators likely charging a small commission to cover running costs. if a validator is found to have performed misconduct a percentage of the their stake but also the nominators stake will be slashed depending upon the severity. for level 4 security threats such as collusion and including an invalid block then 100% of the stake will be slashed.**whats really important to understand is that both the validators own stake and the nominated stake will be slashed, so you could lose all your dot that you have staked against a validator if they perform maliciously. therefore, its very important not to just try and maximise rewards and being oblivious to the risk, not only can you lose all your dot, but you are making the entire system less secure (addressed in** [**part three**](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/polkadot-an-early-in-depth-analysis-part-three-limitations-and-issues-d8b0a795a3e)**). there have already been several minor slashing incidents so far, so something to really consider.**https://preview.redd.it/aj9v0azke6m51.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86134eaef08d1ef50466d1d80ec5ce151327d702## auction for parachain slotsdue to the limited number of parachain slots available, there needs to be a method to decide who gets a parachain slot. this is achieved through a candle-auction where participants bid with dot to secure a lease on a parchain slot to secure a 6  24 month period, with the highest bidders winning. dot isnt spent, but rather locked for the duration of the lease and unable to participate in staking and earn rewards. in the event they are unsuccessful in securing a further slot, then the lease expires and the dot will be returned.of the 100 parachain slots that they hope to be able to accommodate, between 10 and 30 will be reserved for system parachains, with the remaining available for either auction slots or used for parathreads. whilst the dot is returned, due to the limited number of slots available this could result in significant amounts of dot needing to be acquired to secure a slot. how the auction mechanics effect the price of dot also remains to be seen, with potentially a rise from the start of the auction, followed by a fall before the lease ends and the dot are returned. the plan is to continuously have a small amount of parachain auctions going throughout the year, to minimise any unwanted effects. how comfortable developers will be with locking significant amounts of funds in a highly volatile asset for an extended amount of time, also remains to be seen. they could also be in a position where they can no longer afford to keep their lease and have to downgrade to a parathread (providing the application will still function with the reduced performance or migrate to another platform). see [this](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-auction) article for more details on the auction mechanismhttps://preview.redd.it/wp8rvxlme6m51.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=496320d627405362142210e1a4c17ebe43e1f8a1## parathreadsfor applications that dont require the guaranteed performance of a parachain or dont want to pay the large fees to secure a parachain slot, then parathreads can be used instead. parathreads have a fixed fee for registration that would realistically be much lower than the cost of acquiring a parachain slot and compete with other parathreads in a per-block auction to have their transactions included in the next relay chain block. a portion of the parachain slots on the relay chain will be designated as part of the parathread pool.in the event that a parachain loses its slot then it can transition to a parathread (assuming the application can still function with the reduced and varied performance of sharing the slot between many). this also enables small projects to start out with a parathread and then upgrade to a parachain slot when required.## tokendot is the native token of the polkadot network and serves three key functions. (i) it is staked to provide security for the relay chain, (ii) to be bonded to connect a chain to polkadot as a parachain and (iii) to be used for governance of the network. there is an initial total supply of 1 billion dot with yearly inflation estimated to be around 10% providing the optimal 50% staking rate is achieved, resulting in rewards of 20% to those that stake (net 10% when take into account inflation). those that dont stake lose 10% through dilution. should the amount staked exceed the optimal 50% then reward rates reduce as well as inflation to make staking less attractive. likewise if its below 50% then rewards and inflation rate will be higher to encourage staking. staking isnt risk free though as mentioned before.## governancepolkadot employs an on-chain governance model where in order to make any changes to the network, dot holders vote on a proposal to upgrade the network with the help of the council. the council is an entity comprising a 23 seats each represented by an on-chain account. its goals are to represent passive stakeholders, submit sensible and important proposals, and cancel dangerous or malicious proposals. all dot holders are free to register their candidacy for the council, and free to vote for any number of candidates, with a voting power proportional to their stake.any stakeholder can submit a public proposal by depositing a fixed minimum amount of dots, which stays locked for a certain period. if someone agrees with the proposal, they may deposit the same amount of tokens to endorse it. public proposals are stored in a priority queue, and at regular intervals the proposal with the most endorsements gets tabled for a referendum. the locked tokens are released once the proposal is tabled. council proposals are submitted by the council, and are stored in a separate priority queue where the priorities are set at the councils discretion.every thirty days, a new proposal will be tabled, and a referendum will come up for a vote. the proposal to be tabled is the top proposal from either the public-proposal queue or the council-proposal queue, alternating between the two queues.the technical committee is composed according to a single vote for each team that has successfully and independently implemented or formally specified the protocol in polkadot, or in its canary network kusama. the technical committee is the last line of defence for the system. its sole purpose is detecting present or imminent issues in the system such as bugs in the code or security vulnerabilities, and proposing and fast-tracking emergency referenda.## ecosystemwhilst parachains arent currently implemented at this stage, there is a rapidly growing ecosystem looking to build on polkadot with substrate. polkadots cousin, the canary network kusama used for experimentation, was launched last year by the same team and contributes to the early growth of the overall ecosystem. see [here](http://www.polkaproject.com/) for a list of the current projects looking to build on polkadot and filter by substrate based.https://preview.redd.it/rt8i0hqpe6m51.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6bcf26fa84463765f720c3074ee10157c2735f6now that we have covered the basics, in [part two](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/polkadot-an-early-in-depth-analysis-part-two-how-consensus-works-1b2b2f3a2245) i will explain how the consensus mechanism in polkadot works and covering more of the technical aspects.

"locked" meaning if ever i tried to send eth to that address to pay for the gas fee, the bot(s) would instantly withdraw the eth and hijack the transaction. the hacker(s) took around $500 in actual assets, but there were about $600-$700 of eth remaining that was essentially locked in the defi [compound.finance](https://compound.finance) that had a chance to be recovered.  of all the solutions i was suggested to me, only a few that stood out:&amp;#x200b;&gt;" what we need to do is write a script that broadcasts a transaction sending eth to that wallet and a transaction from that wallet to a wrapper contract which atomically rescues the compound funds and sends them to your safe wallet. and if we do so at a time where the ethereum blocks are relatively empty. it should work "another way was to follow [operation crypto kitties rescue](https://medium.com/mycrypto/operation-cryptokitty-rescue-93fd8e00e4f8)and many other instances that involve writing a smart contract to beat the bot with gas fees.# how i actually recovered the funds:with all the wild solutions that were presented to me, i decided to try my luck at just rescuing them by simply trying to catch them at a time where the server the bot was on had some downtime. near the end of july, i saw the funds in defi remain untouched appreciating in value. the $700 that was locked ultimately grew to $1,200. there was only one issue, i lost the private and mnemonic key to that address. ironically, what got me into this mess, also got me out. with all the people reaching out to me, i sent my private key to different people in dms who wanted to run tests and offer a solution however with no avail, they gave up hope. so i sorted through hundreds of messages until i found the private key i sent to someone on discord and reclaimed access.around this time, the ethereum gas fees were high like the weather, and all these defi coins were pumping hard so ultimately i spent around $100 in gas fees alone trying to recover these coins. i sent the coins to the wallet, praying to hope the bot was not activated, and swiftly sending those tokens to a safe wallet. i couldn't send all the tokens since some of them had debt tied to them so i only withdrew 99% of the available amount before the collateralized coins were liquidated. all in all, the process in which i recovered the coins was very simple and very lucky.the transaction in which i recovered my locked funds.

UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// [removed] [removed] [removed] hello, so basically i wanted to ask someone who is experienced with this. this person claims that he has sent me btc on my coinbase wallet, and claims that he is using bcoiner app to send the money, however 45minutes or more have passed and i havent received the money. not even under "recent transactions" if it was pending at least, then i would be okay but since there isnt even a email, nor recent transaction i assume its a scam?so he has shared screen with me on discord, and heres how it looks likestreamable link: [https://streamable.com/hkh5l3](https://streamable.com/hkh5l3)question 1: is there a possibility that the application is created idential to the original onequestion 2: is there a possibility the network confirmations are longer because of the service he is using to transfer?do you think this is a scam or not, should i worry? once again, no email from coinbase nor under recent transactions, not even shown as "pending"he claims he has sent it, and the "payment" occured 1h, 45min from this exact moment of me typing this message. i looked up the number of bitcoin wallets on [www.bitinfocharts.com](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html) and, after not accounting for wallets with less than .1 btc (1000 usd), i realized that less than 16000 (.5%) total wallet addresses control 60% of the current bitcoin distribution. what kind of impact could this have on bitcoins price and would it mean that its easily manipulated? what are your thoughts on such a heavy ownership concentrated by such a small minority? so story here is for some time i've read and informed myself about crypto in general, specifically bitcoin. i'm not either a person that has believed this is made of smoke and mirrors and worthless neither i defend it's the best invention after sliced bred.it obviously can't be worthless **as long as** people want it or trust it. on the other hand it's quite complex for the first time holder, user or buyer so it's not quite the best thing just there. filled with jargon like cold, hot or lukewarm wallets, private and public keys, decentralized, forks, strange names go on and on, and on...so in this comes another issue, getting it. in the past it was easy way too easy. today it's to the extreme opposite. so i managed to understand wallets enough and buying and exchanges, and fees and p2p, yada yada.still i can't buy any. either it's because of banks (maybe) freezing your account, credit cards rejecting the payment, or jumping thorough the hoops of **somewhat** understandable kyc processes.i understand a legal tax paying business has to abide the law and even best practices. but people still are entitled to protect their personal information. where is a selfie a legal requirement to identify a customer? where is a photo of my id or address a means to combat terrorism? people have got this wrong, if i make a bank transfer, there's an identifiable trail right there. worst thing is all this "safe, trustworthy and transparent" customer identification is not even made by the business itself but by external companies that most times one doesn't even know who they are even if you ask.if the issue is crime fighting, don't allow shady quasi antonymous payment methods. the main goal is to prevent people to trade good ol' funny money for another newer form of digital funny money. the secondary goal is public safety.anyway, due to my unease to provide any personal documents to who knows who to be uploaded to a server who knows in what dubious conditions. all it needs is to be hacked, stolen, sold or shared, because it is shared unless these exchanges have a proprietary verification system. once it's there it's like kim kardashians porn video, it wont go away or disappear regardless of whatever gdprs or other privacy laws exist. i just want my privacy, or some of it, i don't need to be completely anonymous.so i turned to p2p in hopes of more private deals. no joy on that. not even i would have to pay considerably more than on any of these law abiding exchanges, all of these bright minded sellers still ask for my id and selfies and what not. are you for real? wont you want a fingerprint and an eye retina scan too? dna? i understand they have a risk, but that risk is part of their business, stay one step ahead, don't use high risk transaction methods. i doubt 5% of the deals made in p2p sites are by businesses that actually need to follow anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws."oh you're a first time buyer we have to verify you", well look at it from the perspective of a crypto noob. i have to trust whoever is on the other side too. now i understand that the bigger risk is for the seller, but what if you're talking to some crypto luddite no way he's gonna send with peace of mind real hard earned cash to an unknown. by the way millions are transacted on the ebays and amazons of this world.well good luck in reaching 100k or 500k or living to see bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency get globally adopted by the masses if no one (new) can buy or use it.i give up. [removed] i want to dca my way into btc through buying $1 worth of btc every single day.coinbase supports automatic periodic buying, but fees are ridiculous. if you buy $1 worth of btc, you lose $0,99 to coinbase fees  so that's pretty pointless ..i've been doing this with revolut so far. since i'm on premium subscription, fees are slim to none. except of course: no wallet, no keys. so i can only sell back to fiat, not transfer or own those btc's ..is there a platform out there that offers both of best worlds?tl;dr: best platform with low fees for periodically buying $1 worth of btc daily?

and is the whole deposit before withdrawal thing common practice? or is this just a straight up scam and am i an idiot? i get the "not your keys, not your coins" reality.however, i don't see a good solution to manage your own keys and also ensure they're not lost/stolen upon death, especially if you would want the coins to go to a minor child.you trust the adult executor to not pocket the keys found in the safe deposit box and say they didn't find any keys?if you get past that hurdle, then the asset would probably be required to be held on behalf of the child until they turn 18, so now someone else is holding the keys for years.if you did manage for the child to get the keys, do you trust the keys to be safeguarded by a minor child?under those circumstances, a custodial service, even an exchange, seems less risky to me.has anyone found a good solution? does anyone hold a bitcoin on revolut?is it a safe place to keep it as i'm not planning to keep huge amounts of it? companies can add extra security layer to their systems by having unencrypted bitcoin wallets with some bitcoin in them on their machines.bitcoin gives the incentive to break the system. so if bitcoin moves we know that the machine is compromised.bitcoin becomes the security gold standard for any device connected to the internet.a new type of mining: discover security hole and get bitcoin. hi!i am a hodler.i want to set up a lighting node so i can make some passive incomes.how much btc would be ok for me to put into the node to get transaction coming through?thanks a year ago i received 500 xlm and today i exchanged it for bitcoin and received the amount i stated above. blockchain can only be used for buying so i cant sell the bitcoin for money. what is a good app for both buying and selling bitcoin?

[removed] hi everyone. so i want to begin investing with bitcoin again, having made a profit last year and sold. i feel that dca would be the safest bet, as i lump summed last year and it took a long time to make a profit. with this in mind, does anyone have advice on when i should begin dca, how often i should rebalance, and how much % i should invest at a time? coinbase, blockchain or brd? hi comrades, i have been looking at the top 10 coin movement and noticed a shit coin named polkadot. anyhow the post is not about the shit coin and what it offers but an action from the developers to re-denominated the token to x100. so any hodlers having 1 token before the change ended up having 100 after the change. this increased the supply of the token 100 times without changing the overall value of the coins that the people were already holding. it did though change the value of one token from 400$ to 4$ overnight (i actually not sure what the value was whe the change happened but you get my point). this resulted in increased interest and massive influx, although nothing really changed except the perceived value of one token.i know the way the value of 1bitcoin is presented has been beaten to a pulp for years now and i know we could just switch from tracking the value of bitcoins to milibits (0.001 btc) and we would actually have the perceived price of buying be reduced but practically that is not very effective or attractive to people who are used in buying shares.think of the following:1)there are 21,000,000 btc. i can buy 1 btc for 10k$. noob thoughts: "it is too expensive.. i missed the boat". the noob does not know about milibits or satoshis. even if he understands the denominations, he will still thing 1 btc is too expensive. because it does not feel right to buy a small part of something. people like completness. you see the pride when newcomers achieve ownership of 1btc. having 0.999btc feels incomplete although practically not different much. nobody will ever own 0.999btc and think: "i don't feel like buying more. i have put enough into this"2)there are 21,000,000 btc. i can buy 1mbtc for 10$. noob thoughts: "what the hell is a mbtc? i want a btc. it is too expensive". people tend to think tokens as shares. they don't want to buy one thousandth of a share in amazon. even if they could they want to buy a whole one, if they can't they may buy a whole one of something else. additional problems: how much fees do i have to pay to buy 1mbtc. the same fees that i have to pay to buy 1btc. that kind of sucks. you are paying for 1mbtc and you will receive 0.9mbtc or even less.3)there are 21,000,000,000 btc. i can buy 1btc for 10$. noob thoughts: awesome, that shit used to be 10k$! also the fees are divided by 1000 so in order to buy 1btc i will pay 0,0001 btc, which i suppose sucks for the miners.  obviously the block reward will be x1000 to keep the mining reward the same but the fees will be reduced to one thousanth. market cap of btc goes to the moon. price of 1btc climbs to 100$ and people still think it is dirt cheap. people who had previously 1btc valued 10k$ end up having 1000btc valued 100k$. also btc can be used for smaller transactions immediatelynow i am not any kind of developer to be able to judge if scenario 3 is impossible to implement or not. also i am not sure how this going to affect participation in securing the network (miners) due to the reduced fees, but it does seem to me away to boost attractiveness and therefore adoption.thoughts? i have a us bank account, which i used to get some savings and payments from sites like upwork. coinbase started requesting ssn and adding that type of bank with another country is not an option, so i am looking for alternatives.i would prefer to know other options besides localbitcoin and bisq for example.thanks for your help!

1. instruments&amp;#x200b;**- magnetic compass (mc)**has variation error in that true north (used by maps etc) is (slightly) different then magnetic north (used by compass), so conversion needed depending on what is used.maps usually reference true poles (north and south pole along rotational axis earth), magnetic compass lines up with magnetic poles, a slightly different axis.&amp;#x200b;deviation error is caused by interference from other magnetic and electric sources in airplane and can be minimized by calibrating counter magnets in compass via knob. any residual error is noted on compass correction card.&amp;#x200b;turbulence, turning and accelerating can also disturb readings.&amp;#x200b;compass is backup tool, hi is primary tool.(or other way round, compass is primary instrument with accuracy flaws which the hi overcomes, not being bound by pole deviation as it's gyro based instead of magnetic).&amp;#x200b;magnetic compass turns in opposite direction as hi because hi display is actually  the back of the instrument.&amp;#x200b;**- heading indicator (hi)**gyroscopic instrument (older name, directional gyro, dg), designed to facilitate the use of the magnetic compass.not vor related, simply provide alternative to mc and are generally used when mc reading may be inaccurate (non straight and level flight).&amp;#x200b;needs to be manually calibrated to magnetic compass in cockpit, before take off with engine running (above idling to provide sufficient vacuum suction to drive gyro's) via card turning knob and checked every 15 minutes in flight (can veer off due to friction or precession).&amp;#x200b;**- course deviation indicator (cdi)**instrument indicating lateral position in relation to a course. when used with vor also called omni bearing indicator (obi).if aircraft is to the left of course, needle deflects to right, and vice versa.uses vor and/or ils signals (not ndb signals like adf uses).&amp;#x200b;the obs (omni bearing selector) knob allows selection (via the outer ring) of the radial (course) to track from a vor station. by turning the card to align its relative heading to the hi heading. when tracking a radial only left/right deviation is indicated with a single needle.for instrument flying you also need to track approach glide slope and thus vertical deviation may also be displayed on a cdi (via ils fix airport i think).&amp;#x200b;**- horizontal situation indicator (hsi)**hi and cdi into one, providing left-right deviation along with glide slope and heading indication in turns.&amp;#x200b;**- radio magnetic indicator (rmi)**similar to cdi, can be used for adf or vor navigation. consists of fluxgate compass eliminating the need to re-calibrate regularly like is needed for the hi (which is used by the cdi).with two needles fixed on two different vor's (or ndb's ?) position can be determined, allowing for flight paths in between stations instead of only to or from.&amp;#x200b;**- relative bearing indicator (rbi)**instrument to display adf's ndb direction. fixed compass card with a needle superimposed, with 0 degree corresponding to plane's centerline. needle at 0 degree position tracks towards ndb (without wind).&amp;#x200b;**- adf vs vor**automatic direction finder (adf) and very high frequency (vhf) omni directional range (vor) are both radio navigation methods but adf is based on non-directional beacons (ndb's) which signals do not contain directional information (needs to be calculated by adf equipment on board) while vor stations send signals with directional information, radio beams called radials, one per degree, 360 degrees around it.both obsolete due to gps but are backup.if plane has distance measuring equipment (dme), most vor's (and some ndb's) can send a dme signal indicating distance.after tuning in to ndb or vor frequency a morse identifier code is transmitted. which can be annoying so can be turned off but unlike vor, which gives a visual indicator if signal gets lost, adf does not visually indicate a lost ndb signal so it can be advised to regularly check the morse transmission is still active.&amp;#x200b;**- turn coordinator (tc)**upper tick mark is level flight, lower tick mark is standard rate turn, being 3/sec or 180/min, taking two minutes to complete a circle.inclinometer (ball in fluid reacting to gravity and aircraft's centrifugal (or centripetal ?) acceleration) indicates coordinated flight / slip / skid. to correct unbalanced aero forces in slip or skid 'step on the ball' (i.e. apply the rudder on the side the ball is swinging).&amp;#x200b;('turn coordinator' (tc) unit is successor to the 'turn and slip coordinator' (t/s), former of which due 30 gyro position displays a change more quickly as it will also react to change in roll before aircraft has begun to yaw. both units having a turn indicator (main gauge) and slip/skid indicator, the little ball).&amp;#x200b;**- attitude indicator (ai)**instrument displaying plane's orientation (roll and pitch) relative to horizon.&amp;#x200b;**- flight director (fd)**instrument overlaid on attitude indicator showing attitude required to follow a planned trajectory.&amp;#x200b;**- air speed indicator (asi)**white 	- flaps rangegreen 	- normalyellow 	- only when smooth airred 	- max&amp;#x200b;kias scale is knots indicated air speed.&amp;#x200b;**- vertical speed indicator (vsi)**instrument displaying rate of descent or climb. also called variometer.&amp;#x200b;**- transponder (xpndr)**onboard identification device for air traffic control (atc) radar, using a 4 digit identifier, the 'squawk' code.'on' only transmits squawk to atc, must be set to 'alt' to also send position and height.'ident' function is to highlight the plane's blip on the radar as may be requested by air traffic control (atc).uncontrolled airspace squawk for us is 1200, europe 7000.using 'squawk' codes.&amp;#x200b;# 2. altitude&amp;#x200b;**- true altitude (ta)**height above mean sea level (msl).&amp;#x200b;**- absolute altitude (aa)**height above ground level (agl).&amp;#x200b;**- indicated altitude (ia)**as shown on altimeter.&amp;#x200b;**- pressure altitude (pa)**indicated altitude with altimeter set to 29.92 inhg (or 1013 hpa).&amp;#x200b;is isa standard pressure, being 29.92 inhg (inches of mercury) at msl.&amp;#x200b;for non-standard pressures, use conversion chart to calibrate altimeter.&amp;#x200b;**- density altitude (da)**pressure altitude corrected for non-standard outside air temperature (oat).&amp;#x200b;pa + (120 x (oat - isa temp)).&amp;#x200b;da chart gives altitude corrections for non-standard temps and pressures.&amp;#x200b;pilot documentation contains performance charts accounting for da (like take off speed, ground roll (distance to rotate), range etc).&amp;#x200b;isa standard temperature is 15c at msl and then about -2c per 1000ft.&amp;#x200b;(-4.8 at 10k ft, -24.6 at 20k ft, -44.4 at 30k ft and -56.5 at 40k ft).&amp;#x200b;isa is international standard atmosphere, with standard values for a.o. pressure and temp.&amp;#x200b;**- flight level (fl)**pressure altitude (pa) divided by 100 feet.&amp;#x200b;\- **height for vfr** (visual flight rules) and **ifr** (instrument flight rules)vfr heights end in 500's of feet, ifr in 1000's.max vfr altitude differs, in us 18000 msl.&amp;#x200b;# 3. speed&amp;#x200b;**- indicated air speed airspeed (ias)**speed shown on the airspeed indicator. accurate at ground level under standard conditions but when air density changes, for instance by climbing (pressure/temps/humidity changes) not anymore.&amp;#x200b;pressure difference between pitot and static port (difference between ram pressure and static pressure, dynamic pressure).not consistent like ground speed (to calculate travel time or fuel load for instance) but it is accurate for pressure differences and hence relevant for stalls, take off and landing speeds which don't care about 'true' speeds but about the pressure / density for lift, which ias indicates.&amp;#x200b;**- calibrated air speed (cas)**calculated via airplane conversion table accounting for position (slow speed and/or flap deflections), instrument and installation error.&amp;#x200b;**- equivalent air speed (eas)**cas corrected for compressibility (of air or something).&amp;#x200b;**- true air speed (tas)**equivalent airspeed corrected for temperature and pressure altitude.&amp;#x200b;calculation to check but for meantime can (probably) be shown on speed indicator by inputting temp and altitude. pilots also have a tool for this (e6-b paper card).&amp;#x200b;**- ground speed (gs)**head wind, tas-wind speed.gs is lower than tas because airplane is opposed by the wind and car can go slower to travel same distance in same time.&amp;#x200b;tail wind, tas+wind speed.gs is higher than tas because airplane is helped by the wind (free speed) and car has to go faster to travel same distance in same time.&amp;#x200b;tas is relative to the air mass so wind speed is not a factor (speed indication is compared to the surrounding air, so with head or tail wind the plane's tas is what it is relative to those flows), but wind does have impact on tas compared to ground speed.with head wind more air molecules hit the pitot so it will read higher than without wind while not increasing it's ground speed (on the contrary ground speed would decrease compared to no wind i'd say).tail wind vice versa, reads lower tas (less molecules over pitot) than without wind while not decreasing it's ground speed (on the contrary ground speed would increase compared to no wind i'd say).&amp;#x200b;# 4. direction&amp;#x200b;**- heading**direction in which longitudinal axis of aircraft is pointed, usually expressed in degrees from north (true, magnetic, compass or grid).&amp;#x200b;**- bearing**the horizontal direction to or from any point, usually measured clockwise from true or magnetic north or other reference point through 360 degrees.&amp;#x200b;**- radial**a magnetic bearing extending from a vor station (or military tacan or combi of the two, vortac).&amp;#x200b;**- track**projection on earths surface of the path of an aircraft, direction of which at any point is usually expressed in degrees from north (true, magnetic or grid).&amp;#x200b;**- wind**&amp;#x200b;ball park method of correcting for cross wind on a track is to turn into it by half the number of the wind strength, so 10kt wind from left is steering 5 to the left to stay on track. too much or little correction will move rmi needle off right or left.&amp;#x200b;# 5. landing&amp;#x200b;**- general**ideal glide slope is 3 degrees (in cessna 152 some 400 ft/mn vsi).vertical speed via throttle, air speed via pitch (approx 60kias).&amp;#x200b;**- instrument landing system (ils)**system for horizontal and vertical guidance when landing. localizer is (sub-)system for the horizontal component.&amp;#x200b;**- non-precision approach**instrument approach and landing with lateral guidance only, no vertical guidance (no electronic glide slope).&amp;#x200b;**- go around (ga)**aborted landing on final approach.&amp;#x200b;**- pattern**also called 'circuit', standard path for taking off or landing while maintaining visual contact with runway, consisting off crosswind section (perpendicular to runway end), 90 left into downwind (parallel to runway), 90 left into base, 90 left into final approach (towards runway).right or left downwind is determined from the perspective of the base (looking in the direction of runway).at airports used as standard path for coordinating traffic. mostly used for general aviation (ga) airfields, not the bigger commercial

(note: 'should', it's theoretical). how do things play out in real life?bottom line, is `bnb` a good investment? what criteria should be used to judge such coins since they are primarily bought for different reasons and by a very small elite and ridiculously rich group of people.

what i like to call the worlds slowest dollar cost averaging method? here are the figures:* $1000 investment in s&amp;p 500 on january 1st, 2018: +$310* $1000 investment in s&amp;p 500 on january 1st, 2019: +$400* $1000 investment in s&amp;p 500 on january 1st, 2020: +$90taken together, heres the bottom bottom*bottom*line for a similar approach with the s&amp;p:**after three $1,000 investments into an s&amp;p 500 index fund in january 2018, 2019, and 2020, my portfolio would be worth $3,800.**that**$3,800**is up over**+27%** [since january 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/), compared to a**+31%**gain of the combined top ten crypto experiment portfolios over the same period of time.for the second month in a row, the better overall investment would be (drum roll please):[***the top ten crypto portfolios***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/)!as youll see in the table below, this is only the second time since i started recording this metric that crypto has outperformed a hypothetical identical investment in the s&amp;p.&amp;#x200b;[combined crypto vs. s&amp;p over three years](https://preview.redd.it/twf4uwbxqbm51.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74525b0fdc5d9598822b965a70dc749e5a5acfea)## conclusion:august was the second straight strong month in crypto and the 2020 top ten continue to do very well compared to traditional markets. as im putting together these reports, both crypto and traditional markets are diving, but these experiments are great for a bit of perspective: there is no question that crypto has been a better investment than traditional markets so far this year. its not even close. how the rest of the year will develop is another question entirely, stay tuned and buckle up.stay healthy and take care of yourselves out there. or better yet, just[pop some popcorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7umux68kte)and enjoy staying in.thanks for reading and for supporting the experiment. i hope youve found it helpful. i continue to be committed to seeing this process through and reporting along the way. feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports. keep an eye out for the original[2018 top ten crypto index fund experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-32)and the[2019 top ten experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-20)follow up experiment.## and the answer isb) paris hiltonat an auction in august,[paris hilton sold a portrait of her cat that fetched 40 eth,](https://cointelegraph.com/news/paris-hilton-drew-a-cat-and-it-somehow-sold-for-17-000-in-eth)about $17,000 at the time. she donated the proceeds of the sale to charity.that's hot. after a long 3-4 weeks.... it's finally here!i'm a sucker for a nice looking card and let me tell you this one looks really good. my first metal card as well. it has a really good sturdy feel but is also quite heavy, i guess that should be expected being metal and all. going to activate it and start using it for my normal spend - i'll let you guys know how it goes with their rewards/cashback!&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/lmyi6cvsmbm51.jpg?width=4014&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bd232d988c3ff0ca9007c986faf7a761a16a63a [removed] **nakamoto coefficient**the minimum number of consensus influencing parties that can form a majority (i.e. &gt;50%)---**charts**[bitcoin hashrate 3 months ago](https://i.imgur.com/oqc3aj6.jpg)[bitcoin hashrate now](https://i.imgur.com/ndqzbwl.jpg)(note that btc.com and antpool are both bitmain)source:https://btc.com/stats/pool---[nano representatives 3 months ago](https://i.imgur.com/fa9ea87.jpg)[nano representatives now](https://i.imgur.com/6x4zaxk.jpg)source:https://nanocharts.info/p/01/vote-weight-distribution---bitcoin appears to be getting more centralized over time, while nano appears to be getting more decentralized. thoughts?

[removed] [removed] [removed] the title of this post certainly wont come as a surprise to many of you and even the content of this post will be obvious to some of the long-time members of this community. however, i think it is an important reminder on an ever-present issue and the more aware of this problem we are, the better we can fight it. we also have an ever growing number of new users who will be unaware of the darker side of crypto reddit.recently i caught a shady defi project vote manipulating posts and astroturfing in some of their comment sections. they were advertising their project (a sushi copycat which is just a fork of uniswap) by sharing a link to a medium post called a community report. seems reasonable enough, right? but what wasnt reasonable was the 20 upvotes which it had gathered in just 30 minutes in r/ethtrader. now this on its own isnt unprecedented. however, it did seem odd given that this post wasnt a meme or groundbreaking news. in fact, it was a seemingly boring article about a project i had never heard of. so i decided to do some more investigating. the post had a 100% upvote percentage, once again, not impossible, but not common for a post with this many upvotes. upon investigating the users post history, ***the following things were telltale signs of an astroturfing account:***- all of the recent posts and comments were about the same project.- before the posts about the project there was a long period of a few months where they hadnt posted. (this is indicative of an account purchased off a 3rd party website which sells used accounts to bypass new user and low karma limits.)- many of the posts and comments had poor grammar, punctuation and in some cases broken/poor english.- the content was very repetitive.if you would like to see examples, just check out all of the users and comments in this thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/keykeyfi/comments/immsgh/introducing_keykey_the_community_owned_dex/naturally, i decided to [call them out for it](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/iolux8/community_report_keykey_premine_block_10820000/g4er37s/?context=3) and i reported the post. a few hours later the post had been removed and people seemed to agree with me as my comment made it to about 5 upvotes. i check in again the next morning and my suspicions were confirmed. overnight, the community had turned on me and i was at -45 upvotes and by coincidence the op shill had deleted his account. i am of course kidding about the community turning on me. this was the evidence i needed to prove that there were vote manipulators and paid shills backing or even behind this project.admittedly, just because a project has bots or actual paid shills doesnt make it an illegitimate project (im not talking about the average user wanting to pump their bags here, i mean literal paid shills). however, its definitely a big red flag. combined with other red flags such as [a subreddit with restricted submissions](https://old.reddit.com/r/keykeyfi/), you can tell if a project is genuine of if its a pump and dump or worse (hint: this projects seems very pumpy and dumpy to me).***so now that you know what to look out for, heres what we can do to to keep this community free of it.***- **downvote any suspicious content.** if vote manipulation could be involved, this may not do a lot. but downvoting content helps to keep the crap off the front page.- **call them out for it.** let everyone else in the community know when a post is fake or being manipulated. at the very least it will help people to question what they see and make them less likely to fall for scams in the future.- **use the report button.** the mods do an incredible job keeping the crypto community relatively clean from spam. you have to remember it is an impossible job to remove all of the spam and their hard work goes largely unappreciated. the least we can do is help them out by flagging what is suspicious. as r/ethfinance mod u/jtnichol shared [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/iooew6/daily_general_discussion_september_8_2020/g4i475a/), the mods are even willing to be proactive if you share any spammers you see in other crypto subs with the mods of related subs.finally, as this bull run goes on, this is only going to get worse and worse. we really havent seen anything yet in this defi bubble. so be sure to spread the word so that anyone new to the space also knows what to look for and how to keep crypto subreddits clean.p.s: i have probably missed a few red flags in spotting suspicious content, so please share any others in the comments. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] **what if tomorrow we all stopped using money.**what if everyone turned cash into crypto and stopped paying taxes to our government.  we could still pay state taxes and come up with ways to do this locally and in fact we would probably have more money to spend than ever before.  our cities would flourish and function as individual units.  however they wish, no influence from outside government.  if everyone did this simultaneously, or at least most everyone, there is nothing they could do to stop it.its that simple.the technology now exists for us to do this.thats right!its here now!while this obviously is not truly possible overnight, because of scaling issues as well as understanding of everyday people, we are in fact on our way.how ?decentralization.we dont need their money.  we dont need their influence.  we dont need their corruption.we dont need donald trump.we dont need joe biden.we choose them.now its time we choose ourselves, our familys, our neighbors, our towns, our cities, our country!lets take back whats ours !lets take control of our future !its our duty to tell as many people as possible about crypto and blockchain technology so that when the time comes everyone is ready.there are much more important things going on than catching the next moonshot so you can profit 10x.  thats great and all.  keep doing it, but also work on informing people who dont know.spread the word.crypto can change the world if we let it. [removed] as i understand, these yield farming tokens are hyper inflationary by design, and i'm generally curious on how price performs when selling starts. my assessment is that many of these tokens can lose 90 percent of their value in seconds if just a few people sold.and ethereum itself has benefited greatly from this yield farming frenzy.  most of us believe bitcoin will eventually see much higher prices of the coming years. most people believe ethereum is a great long term investment in line with bitcoin, but i see the opposite. ethereum is just the platform for pump and dumps, and therefore ethereum is just a higher cap pump and dump coin. [removed] [removed] i got banned for saying the word gay on this sub, i feel thats inappropriate.i'm actually wondering why it matters? like if people don't like a certain word being used in such a manner they'll down vote itwhy don't we respect people enough to decide for themselves if they are okay with certain speech?feels like pandering  to just ban people outright.on that post that was taken down it had like 500 up votes because people realized i wasn't actually disrespecting people who are gay and was instead making a point using provocative language.idk, thoughts? i've done the toolkit or pointing my xrp account at the flare network for claiming, i've gotten the confirmation of successful completion, my question is this: if there aren't a whole lot of wallets that have openly claimed to support the token and only a few exchanges so far, once the tokens are dispersed to the accounts of the various xrp holders, where do the tokens go?.. for example, the xumm wallet is only for xrp and the mew is only for eth (and erc20's) so if you used that method to claim, how would you even get to your spark tokens or see how many you have or do anything with them at all if there's no way to do that?.. i know there's probably a lot more information and details to come about all of this as we get closer to the snapshot date but i've looked everywhere, read articles, gone all over the flare network site, and spent hours on youtube trying to find anything about this and all that anyone has commented on is how to claim them. nothing about where they go when they're claimed, what program, app, wallet, or anything to use to hold them, nothing. please educate me or just tell me that i'm not alone in my confusion or lack of knowledge on the matter.

upload it on the internet somewhere in different words like a hidden message that only you know? maybe tattooing it on yourself is genius. i'm still amazed bitcoin attracts both the far-left and the far-right, both the enemies of free speech and the rural resisters who hate silicon valley's technological overlordship.sadly, these polar opposites don't mix. and if, as we've seen with defi, we are going to live with "protocol politicians" to help guide our behaviors, bitcoin is at risk of being hijacked by the likes of jack dorsey, twitter ceo and king of censorship.you can't mix freedom-of-money advocacy with freedom-from-money advocacy.i wonder how dorsey will prevent "people he doesn't like" from using cryptocurrencies. probably block our bank accounts. what is the reason for drop off in full nodes? it seems the .onion tor nodes are not showing? forex is real, it's just that investors don't get the right tools to win, all you need is the perfect broker, the signals and the perfect strategies plus knowledgeable market vantage points. you can also trade on your own and earn very good profits. i am currently reading "mastering bitcoin" and i learned a lot of news things. but a questions keeps bugging me:if bitcoin grows around 1 terabyte each decade (i know, this is not yet the case), that is completely fine. but the fullnodes store the whole history and validate against the whole past, right? also wallets, that "restore from a private key" (you setup a new wallet with an old private key, so it has to check the full bitcoin history for your funds).**won't those be extremely slow mechanisms in the future? what is bearable now, will it be super cpu-intensive in several years?** the mempool takes unconfirmed transactions, but in the end, it only "accepts" them, if they are valid. so the node has to validate all of them right? the longer the chain, the longer that takes, right?

[removed] for those who remember for a post exactly a week ago, i deposited btc on binance and wanted to buy bzrx as it was a bit cheaper than on uniswap - big mistake.first they asked me to verify account (even though amount was 1 btc which is way below 2 btc which is limit for non-kyc)after that my withdrawal was still locked and they asked for a face recognition via their app which was completed.after that my withdrawal was still locked and they asked for a video of me talking "hi this is me and i really want to withdraw my money from binance" and it was completed a week ago and i didnt receive a single response except their customer support here on reddit who told me to "spare him whining" and that "1 btc is obviously just a drop in a bucket for me" obviously trying to turn story in his favor, but the bottom line is that i deposited 1 currency, paid fees to exchange it into another currency and now they are holding my money, completely ignoring me, for a week. [removed] i have someone telling me all about this site and buying into this coin right now before it becomes available to purchase for everyone else. you need a code to sign up for the site and then trade btc for fec. is this a scam? it feels pretty scammy but doing online searches doesn't really come up with anything. [removed] apologies if this is an faq -- i have been unable to find an answer to this question. all of the platforms that seem to allow users to swap btc or eth for yfi are not open for us citizens, so i am wondering if there is something obvious i am missing... [removed] [removed] [removed] i'm really not trying to shill or anything, but i find it so refreshing that certain coins don't have a high transaction fees. how can a coin like monero have such low transaction fees while still obfuscating all transactions, when coins like btc or ethereum are ridiculous.while transaction fees are high, i'm mainly complaining about transfer fees from exchanges. those fees are insanely high. just transferred some ethereum off of bitstamp and i paid approximately 12 eur for the privilege to be able to do that.that's just dirty imo.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] this is a follow up to my last post (in a different subreddit) about yfdai. im going to be making callbacks to my previous post, just as a preface. the biggest risk that i outlined (the 35% of coins dedicated for staking not being locked in any way) has been fixed, as the coins are now in a smart contract and staking is being worked on. the relative anonymity of the team still stands, though they are branching out and have expanded their team a bit to include people on the community that arent so anonymous.so far, the team has proven that they are in the market to contribute to the security and technology of the project. marketing will be underway shortly, though i wanted to update the community on this since this is still an early time. there is a great amount of potential here! once the marketing starts, id say that there would be little opportunity in way of being an early investor.in terms of what is coming up, the website illustrates the roadmap. getting listed on coingecko and coinmarketcap have been achieved, theyve had their project audited, set up staking, and even have a confirmed exchange listing coming. there is plenty that has happened to boost the teams credibility. once again, dyor and consider investing into something that is trying to be different than other projects circulating in the market with great risk behind them.in case you want to check out the community:website:- www.yfdai.finance [removed] [removed] [removed] hey everyone.i've been using coinspot for a few months and buying various crypto.i'm curious as to peoples thoughts on when it is a good idea to get a wallet and move my coins off an exchange?i understand i don't "own" the coins whilst they are on an exchange such as coinspot, and of course am looking to keep things as secure as possible.thanks in advance for any and all advice.

i know it's not \*quite\* as secure, but due to the way i had managed to store my seed over the years, it would be quite preferable to use this seed. it took a while to get my cold storage security right and it would be a pain in the ass to use a new seed.2) i dont quite understand the coldcard encrypted backup. why would i need a backup with an additional 12 words if i already have my seed secured? the seed phrase is the backup... if my coldcard got destroyed, i could simply restore my seed word in a new cold card or on any wallet, yes?also - i guess i would like to be reassured that the coldcard is not too difficult to use. i'm not tech-ey per say but i'm pretty capable. i'm technical enough that i used a raspberry pi to build a mynode, got it up and running and seemingly working fine from the dashboard, but can't seem to get it to connect to any lightning wallets, lol... i will probably be using bank transfer or paypal as it is more convenient than cash. i am wondering what the best marketplace for me to use is if i want to get it cheap (i.e. minimal transaction fee etc) but still somewhere trustworthy. i don't mind having to do id verification if i only have to do it once for my account, but i want to be able to buy bitcoin quickly on demand after everything is set up. i got banned on paxful for idk what but i would do gift card to bitcoin transactions when i needed coin. i noticed local bitcoin stopped doing amazon gift cards, too...is there any other sites or options? simply bitcoin, a channel that breaks down all the daily bitcoin news. from twitter to important updates to cringy daily fails we have it all.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmnumhyfrgs&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmnumhyfrgs&amp;feature=youtu.be) never really was one for watching sports, but i've come to realize that investment reasons aside believing in bitcoin is synonymous with "cheering my favorite team on". at the end of the day if bitcoin is going through big dips or rallying i'm team btc all the way.

(estimated year when all 21 million bitcoins will get mined - got this from various sources) will no one mine any longer? will mining be less expensive once technology advances? will it all expire? app to buy bitcoin in ?someone suggested coin base but i wouldnt like to be scammed.. i need low or zero transfer fees.thanks giant companies might buy most bitcoin and for average joe like us how will it make sense? it will be impossible for universal adoption if this happens. can they change the code and make units smaller than 1 satoshi?and when machine learning advances, it might be too easy to bruteforce and find seeds of wallets in no time?this could be a dumb question. will appreciate your thoughts is there a solution for a multisig wallet that automatically returns the funds the buyer put in, if the deal is off and the seller (the second party of the wallet) is dragging his feet to return the funds? because it's the biggest drawback of a 2of2 multisig wallet, once the other party loses interest in the deal after the funds are already in escrow - and has no incentive to sign a transaction to return the funds. [removed] been doing some thinking on financial investments tonight, and got to thinking. ive been kicking myself for years and heres why. like the title says, i owned bitcoin way back when it was around $420 a coin.back then in high school i used to use bitcoin to buy weed (semi) anonymously on the dark web, so i could sell it in person and make some extra money.there were plenty of times when i owned 5-6 coins at a time. (yes i was a high school weed dealer sourcing my product from the darknet lmao, crazy times)anyways every once in a while i look back and think. if i had just held those coins instead of spending them on fucking marijuana, i could have seen my investment turn into 40-50-60 thousand dollars, maybe even more.no matter what your doing, keep investments in your mind.goldsilvereurosdollarscrypto,whatever.you never know what will happen that's it...happy weekend! please utilize this sticky thread for all general **bitcoin** discussions! if you see posts on the front page or /r/bitcoin/new which are better suited for this daily discussion thread, please help out by directing the op to this thread instead. thank you!if you don't get an answer to your question, you can try phrasing it differently or commenting again tomorrow.[join us in the r/bitcoin chatroom!](https://s.reddit.com/channel/872992_7f67f22e296c2f65bd39f5af98f30a96b5e3e21e)please check the [previous discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/iqlnr0/daily_discussion_september_11_2020/) for unanswered questions. btc/usdt 4 hour.i hear a few trading for tether the other day and calling for a further drop below 10k usd.one of my favs called for this correction to be one that doesn't breach 10k with conviction, personally i've been on his side with this call and it was made quite early as well.  now though it is only fair to make this assumption at the current time regarding bitcoin against the dollar.to the traders in the room... ?isn't this a clear reversal pattern?, or is the possible inverted h&amp;s invalidated by the fact the 2nd shoulder has extended too far to maintain the possible inverted h&amp;s pattern?

why did this change?2. when i book a profit, it registers my overall profit, but as soon as i make a new buy in leverage, my profit goes down. why would this be? i have not lost anything. i am making a completely new trade.these two things never used to happen. is something wrong with their code? just a reminder of how dangerous and unregulated this field is....i was on coinmarketcap looking at the standings. i checked out of crypto for a while in the middle of 2018. its surreal to see so many cryptos that were highly touted, shilled, and promising to have fallen from grace and not even get mentioned anymore. im not talking about price drops from bear market but cryptos just falling in market rank because nobody is interested in them anymore for various reasons. i remember when cryptos like the following would be mentioned regularlymetalfactomwaltonchainsaltpivxfun fairsubstratumnanooyster (prl)now nobody even talks about them. some for obvious reasons like scamming, vulnerabilities, etc. but my point is projects can just die when they were once highly favored and viewed as quality or consistent compared to their peers. at the time the above projects had strong followings that honestly dont feel different than many other coins at the moment. all the telegrams and subreddits have the exact same feel to them back then as they do now. just swap the name of the coin and you cant tell the difference from all the moon memes, gifs, chart readings, rabid fandom etc.....i say all this just to say dont forget the environment we are in, how easily many of us will get burned on the path to adoption and too take equity out of the house and go all in on skycoin baby !!!.....   j/k. stay safe, and be diligent in your research. [removed] just making this post to help out peoples investing strategy in general as i'm seeing posts on "how to trade".&amp;nbsp;for basically all assets/securities (stocks, bitcoin, ethereum, etc...) that have an expected upward long term trajectory, there are typically only a handful of days out of the year where all the gains are made.  like 10-15.  all the rest (~350 days) the price makes small up and down moves, or down moves. this is why investing is a game of patience above all else.&amp;nbsp;interestingly for bitcoin as an example, there are many years where if you eliminated the best 10 days, you would actually be negative in returns, even in the best years.  and if you miss just the best few, your gains are cut in half.&amp;nbsp;this is why trading and being out of the market for too much time is risky for any asset you think is going up because you have a good chance of missing those 10-15 or so days that are critical.&amp;nbsp;no idea if this is helpful or too obvious but just wanted to mention this.

[removed] [removed] i was thinking about doing some binance defi staking, as i am not planning on cashing out any time soon, what are the risks involved? is it worth it to do it with 15eth of value or am i going to lose money on it?is it really as simple as a just choosing the amount you want to stake and clicking?the return seems really high for that to be possible without much risk? akoin is akon's cryptocurrency project that has been in development for the last couple of years. it's a platform designed to offer africans a sound dependable currency as well as giving access to 3rd party "defi" services such as lending and investment opportunities. the platform also features a dapp building tool to give developers the opportunity to create and list their product or service online and trade in and out of akoin.with a huge name like akon behind this project and the news that the currency is already planned to be used as the sole currency of both the mwale medical and technology smart city in kenya and akon's own akon city in senegal it look like this project could really take off.could akoin be a major driving force in the development of africa and empowerment of the african people? [removed] i really would like to make a purchase this week but i'm stuck. i don't have my id/drivers license because of the dmv being completely mobbed. i have already existing accounts on both exchanges that i made several large buys on years ago, but now years later they want me to verify again. im unable to trade in anyway on these platforms. is there any viable alternative for me for the time being? if so what is it and how can i go about it? whats the downside to this option? [removed] i'm getting back into buying crypto and i am wondering what my best option is here. years ago i got in before the huge jump when btc/ltc/ether shot up. i got pretty lucky because truly it was a gamble, i didnt really understand each coin and exchange. what im getting at is i made a coinbase account, bought crypto in august of 2017, then sold it december 2017. i never got back into it because i figured i had my run of luck.so my interest is back and i want to learn more. i want to purchase ether this week and im curious what exchange i should use. i have both a coinbase and binance account.edit: unable to verify because my id is expired due to the dmv being a disaster because of covid. is there anywhere i do not need to verify? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] there is so much to know about cryptocurrencies and it's always evolving and changing. are there such things as cryptocurrency investment firms (or brokerages) that will do most of the monitoring and trading for me? if so, are there any you best recommend? [removed] so ive been buying bitcoin for the last 3 years. constant monthly purchases and grinding as many sats as possible. i have a target of 1 million euro net worth which keeps me focused and eyes on the target. im 100% bitcoin and so should you. however, i did have an altcoin phase in the beginning. most of you have altcoins, thats why youre in this subreddit. if youre not a scammer but a blue-eyed investor, maybe you should read my thoughts below and make some thinking. who knows, it might spark a shitcoinless phase in your life. or at least push you closer to making that decision in the future, when youre ready. just like during a bear market your bitcoin allocation increases, in the long run your bitcoin allocation will be 100% (the shitcoins went to zero). enjoy!http://er-bybitcoin.com/altcoinfessions/ [removed] [removed] [removed] there were a lot of negative comments at the top before the paid ones appeared. mainly because ivan is running a pump and dump scheme (see [as if his cancerous thumbnails and overexaggerated titles weren't enough.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/comments/ifuve6/as_if_his_cancerous_thumbnails_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3))however, it looks like something with the paid comments went horribly wrong, because nearly all of them are duplicated:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6jzspxkw0m&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6jzspxkw0m&amp;t=1s)what a shame, are there any trustworthy crypto youtubers at all?! other than the defi boom, that is.hard to believe that with bitcoin sitting around $10k for quite a while now that there isn't more talk regarding it (by traditional media sources).there was a time when $10k bitcoin was pie in the sky. now it is just ho hum. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] hey /r/cryptocurrency!i would like to explain the (dev)eloper protocol to you guys. i find it a breath of fresh air to the whole staking mechanisms that are currently hot in crypto world, because this project adds donating to the staking world. giving people motivation to donate again.**what does it do?**with dev protocol, you stake in order to get more dev over time, like other projects. but with a small difference, the developer you stake with, also gets paid in the same token. you get paid to donate, basicly. and you can also use dev to govern the platform for proposing new markets and policies.**so how is this interesting?**one of the use cases lies with github at the moment. github has many projects that are open source and build out of hobby/love/interest but do not receive enough payments. also quite some nice projects are dead simply because developers cant devote their time to something anymore or because they lack the motivation. people may not be interested in donating, but they are interested in making money just like all the other greedy bastards in crypto! (looking at ~~you~~ myself) ;) dev protocol makes sure that both the donator and the developer are rewarded.with dev protocol, a developer can sign up at [https://stakes.social/](https://stakes.social/) at put their project out there. then people can choose to stake in that pool, and with that, rewarding the developer (or anyone else) for their work, and you get rewarded for rewarding, basicly.and there is also protecting against fraud and dev's or creators doing nothing: a quote from the website:&gt;"dev's characteristic is that as the "proof of oss power," it uses the results of creators' activities as the mining power. open assets are now economically valued and rewarded for activity."**what's next?**the project has a smart team (based in japan), that already released a easy to use github integration and aims to reward all open assets later. (so probably also a replacement for onlyfans etc hint hint) the website is also gaining a complete makeover soon, and there currently is a code audit ongoing that will make sure there are no leaks in the code. you can also find the roadmap for more things coming up.**where lies the value of the project?**the higher the worth of the dev token, the more rewards you and the developers(or other people) get. this means people who buy and hold or stake dev are actually making sure the payouts to developers around the world are higher, so indirectly you are donating money by purchasing dev and holding it. i see dev as a token that is one of the only morally good projects that really could help the world, as there are many nice projects that are currently dead or abandoned due to lack of funding. ***this project is really something to motivate people to donate once again, as they get paid for donating.*** the current apy of dev is 69% but varies a lot, depending on how much is staked and how much isn't. the governance of dev is also for its token holders and stakers.**how do i know this will succeed?**you dont have to, it already did succeed. amongst others, vyper, a programming language originally conceived by our well known mr vitalik, which is also used for curve finance and uniswap v1, is already a project under the developer protocol and is gaining funding simply because others stake at their pool. you can also see on the main website that the numbers are positive. already 70k of rewards distributed, and already 1500 oss projects onboard.website: [https://devprtcl.com/](https://devprtcl.com/) and [https://stakes.social/](https://stakes.social/)&amp;#x200b;**tl;dr:** stake $dev tokens to donate $dev to your favorite developer (or creator later on) and you get paid $dev for it as well.&amp;#x200b;friendly disclaimer: of course i own some dev tokens, and let this article only be part of your research into this project and always check out more things about the project.&amp;#x200b;hope you like the article i wrote, and let me know any questions! thanks for reading =) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed]

[removed] if btc has a fixed mineabble supplywould that cause a spike in fees, since miners would only profit from transactions?would that make btc a less favorable coin for miners?would transactions take longer on the block chain when miners decide to stop mining?some of these questions might be misguided, if so please point me to enlightening articles.

what do you think about [bitcoin directory](https://cryptodirectories.com/crypto-directory/bitcoin)?im spending almost a month developing this projectwhen i start this im positive that it can help new users discover websites related to bitcoin.because when i start in bitcoin it takes a lot of time before i find out something new about bitcoinso recently i start to think what can i do to help a newbiethe conclusion is to build a website where i can categories every website related to bitcoinso a newbie can discover the website they will need in the future if they plan their journey in bitcoinbut today i ask myself again if this really can help a newbiethat why i want to ask your opinion and suggestion.do you find it helpful or not? why? check out the bitcoin.com wallet at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitcoin.mwallet hi folks. i am new to bitcoin and would like to know which wallet (mobile ios) and which exchange is the best to use in canada for the purpose of sports betting. thank you. been thinking about this a bit, and i keep looking out every few months and there's still no real good option imo.these are 2 options that i've been longing for, but it seems to be hard to come by.1. bip 39 seed phrase with **custom length** options. most seem to be 12 or 24 and that's it. you can't restore a 24 word phrase on a wallet that only does 12 words, or whatever. in an ideal scenario we follow bip39 protocols and say allow 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 long phrases. in some ways the unknown length offers some security and allowing users to select their own desired length (having a minimum of 12 to maintain reasonable security) can help with that. what's crazy is almost no wallet allows restoring of custom length phrases. i've found that bitpay actually is one of the few that works with a 15 word phrase for instance.2. cross-platform. not only just ios and android, but desktop and maybe even web (run locally in the browser) would be cool. think of how discord and slack are loved for group messaging. they're on every mobile platform, desktop platform, and on the web. why does this matter? ease of use. i shouldn't have to worry about my coins if i switch from ios to android or vice versa. exodus seems to come the closest here. i have a synced node, and i would like to create a pruned copy of that node without destroying all blocks and chainstate i already have.  my thought would be to run two copies of bitcoin `{bitcoina.exe, bitcoinb.exe}`, while offline and bound to `127.0.0.1`.  both a and b point to each other through a `connect` or `addnode` config setting.  my thought would be that now the "blank" bitcoin node (bitcoinb) would download and prune all the block data from bitcoina via localhost.i can imagine that i'd need separate data, block and chainstate dirs.  i'll need separate rpc-cookies and separate ports.surely this is a fairly common way to clone block data.  has anyone done this before?  thoughts or advice? hi everyone, i'm writing here because i have earned some bitcoins on the [purse.io](https://purse.io) website. i was looking for a way to convert them to euros, but all the websites i've looked for only allow people over 18. is there a way i can sell my bitcoins and get euros if i'm 17?

i'm wondering which would be the most efficient way to damage the bitcoin network, in terms of cost / damage ratio. to my understanding 51% attack allows double spending and blocking new transactions by taking control of the majority hashing power, and transaction flooding only allows the latter by broadcasting transactions with fees just above the average fee in the mempool.of course a 51% attack on bitcoin is very unlikely considering the sheer amount of hashing, but i'm talking about cost efficiency. if an attacker had $x and wanted to do the most damage, would they attempt a 51% attack with $x worth of electricity/equipment or transaction flooding with $x worth of transaction fees? ...along with retail investors and yet every time there's a spike in either direction thre are always thousands of btc involved.  it goes up and 4k btc are involved yet almost immediately the same amount is available on the sell side...for every buyer there is a seller or whatever stupid cliche someone here wants to quote is either not capable of critical though or is involved.  it is blatant wash trading period. selling my shit and moving to costa rica. is bitcoin used at all there? merchants and such? is this bullish or bearish? please no noob comments stating that it is not. talking to daily traders who have been looking at the charts daily basis. personally not happy with this, i prefer the very volatile btc, are volatility days now gonna be correlated with stocks too? this is getting ... boring. hey there, i am currently a small investor in btc and usually do small investments but my friend is new to the field and one of his friends is telling him and showing him proof ( which i havent seen or know nothing about ) that he enter big investment deals with big markets usually with 10btc and he earn like 20btche currently own 8 btc and his friend is telling him that he needs at least 10 to enter the trade with him so that he can earn even up to the doubleit seems a little sketchy and i know its but my friend is unaware of the bitcoin system and his friend is showing him proofs and such thingsi am worried that his friend is trying to scam himi have tried to search about such deals and investments but havent found anything yetis there is any proof that such things exist ?

[deleted] hey guys, [here's a crappy little node herder](https://github.com/brianddk/reddit/blob/master/python/btc-herder.py)^(1) to try to find nodes running with the `minrelaytxfee` manually set.  i started by looking at [addy's excellent python walker](https://github.com/ayeowch/bitnodes) but thought the amount of work i would need to do to pair it down would be better spent just busting some poc out.the script basically just takes a nodes `addnode` list and `bannode` list to narrow the window of available candidates.  the object is to (painfully) slowly allow your node to connect to each reachable node on the network.  base telemetry of each connected node is gathered with `getnodeinfo`.  here's the basic flow:1. (slowly) do a dns dig to get an ipv4 / onion endpoint list from a pool of seeders2. test the port of each using netcat (`nc`)3. add known nodes to the `addnode` list4. gather telemetry of each connected node using `getnodeinfo`5. ban (24h) nodes after 5 minutes to force new connections6. repeatby artificially limited the list of available endpoints, our node will eventually connect to nodes we haven't yet talked to so we can gather more info.i ran it for a few hours on testnet (ipv4/onion) before killing it.  i found 6171 nodes, 1570 of which were accepting incoming connections on, and 415 of which i actively collected telemetry on.  about 7.5% of the nodes were allowing txns below the default `minrelaytxfee` rate.since i was planning on testing miner acceptance of txns below the default relay fee, i needed a way to find all the nodes that might accept them.  this was my attempt to get my node to personally handshake with each node in the network.it's a little toy script, and i might pretty it up later, but it was still a fun experiment.* https://github.com/brianddk/reddit/blob/master/python/btc-herder.py^(footnotes:)^(1 - i realize this is an inorganic way to do node discovery and violates the spirit of txn propogation, but its just a toy and \(i believe\), mostly harmless) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i've been pretty much ignoring the defi situation but i just read an article about a new defi coin name after a pickled vegetable (im not trying to name drop).  i read about other ones that end up being worthless or scamming and just copy-paste.  reminds me of the good old cryptsy days and the 100's of copy-paste coins coming out.i'm to old for that shit, just going to stay with my classics.

[removed] i'm getting so frustrated with kraken. after so many years of errors, again today: **"ooops. bad gateway."**what is going on here? this can't be a coincidence. i think somebody is profiting from it somehow, because it usually happens when prices are moving. maybe some ddos-attack from some trading mafia or another exchange to profit somehow? any ideas?what is also frustrating: if you take the time to post in r/kraken: just don't! they outright delete it (of course **after** you took 10 minutes of your time to write a post). then they tell you to go to r/krakensupport, again, you take 10 minutes of your time to write a post. guess what: they outright shadow-ban it, which is the most frustrating experience at all. hey folks, i am trying to get my full crypto history organized using koinly. when i move coins from coinbase to coinbase  pro (5 eth say, not changing to another crypto or fiat, just moving the coins), koinly shows it as profit taking, and calculates it as a taxable event.is this correct?

UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// hi,not sure about that title but i'll try to explain. i am still learning and wondering: as decentrilized as bitcoin is, what if big companies, government, banks etc. start investing billions in bitcoin and just hold or use other strategies to make profit or something else? wouldn't it ruin bitcoin's ideology and its value ?it's probably already happening, i guess a lot of public figures who publicly hate cryptos are actually secretly investing but, what is the aftermath of this if there is any?also, wouldn't bitcoin just become the mirror of global wealth if it isn't already? i mean, in the long run, wouldn't this whole thing become a pyramid where 10% of existing wallets would detain 85% of the bitcoins and control de market? wouldn't this be even worse with bitcoins being limited to 21mil?could you explain me like i was five please?i've made peace with the fact i am gonna be poor my whole life but i just find this fascinating and want to understand this whole stuff.thank you [removed] [removed] seems like it wont let me or the fee are like half the coin. noob here someone commented on a post a suggestion that has been sporadically coming back to me since i read it.the suggestion was that everyone should flip the terminology of satoshi and bitcoin to where the former would denote what is now 1 btc and vice versa.the time to do it is really now, while everything is still yet to come. having the smaller amount be called bitcoin will make things easier for newcomers. they hear about bitcoin, and that will be the more natural way to conduct typical, small transactions. i just think its more likely that well hear this sweater costs 12 bitcoins than this sweater costs 12 satoshis. second, having the larger amount denote staggering wealth would be a great homage to the person, himself/herself.we could even take a poll where everyone agrees to abide by the winning choice. thatd give the decision the authority of democracy. not only do these transactions indicate the concentrations of wealth bitcoin has helped create, but they also provide clear examples of  bitcoins strengths.taking the top spot, one bitcoin wallet moved 161,500 btc on april 10, 2020. at the time, this bitcoin was worth roughly $1.1 billion, making it the biggest bitcoin transaction of all-time.[https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/here-are-the-5-biggest-bitcoin-transactions-in-history/](https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/here-are-the-5-biggest-bitcoin-transactions-in-history/) in august, nasdaq traded company, microstrategy, took their cash reserves and dumped it in favor of bitcoin.now, the company is doubling down and purchased another $175m in btc.microstrategy shareholders might be in for a wild ride :-)[https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/microstrategy-buys-more-bitcoin-doubling-down-on-strategy/](https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/microstrategy-buys-more-bitcoin-doubling-down-on-strategy/) ok, so i have bitcoins in my electrum wallet.  i tried to send 0.5042 bitcoin to my friend.1km3a5keabhbmxfqegwbm2mdqg48djhv8xhe said he never got the coins.  i look at my wallet and it seems i lost the fees, but the 0.5042 was indeed not deducted from my wallet.  i proceed to try to send the coins again with a higher fee, but still nothing.[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1km3a5keabhbmxfqegwbm2mdqg48djhv8x](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1km3a5keabhbmxfqegwbm2mdqg48djhv8x)&amp;#x200b;here shows at  **2020-09-15 14:22** and  **2020-09-15 20:26** that the coins did enter his wallet right?

ive been looking for a cheap alternative for a while and was happy to find something built on bitcoin. ive tried bitpay, but wasnt happy. i also tried to get some others, but they never came available for me.your recommendations will be appreciated. hi everyone,my name is scott stedman, i'm an investigative journalist from california.did you do business with btc-e/mayzus financial services ltd/moneypolo/ any other related entities and still have bank wire information? i would love to speak with you. anonymity respected.feel free to dm. any experience in this? im 20 and work construction, but i work alone so ive had plenty time to listen to various youtubers and podcasts so im not completely lost, but still. i (just last week, at the dip) bought $160 worth on coinbase pro and im keeping it in electrum, planning on hardware wallet once the amount is relevant. is the best approach for my position to just buy like $150 of btc every 2 weeks? im familiar with options trading, and know theres options for btc but the idea sounds like gambling as you cant play events like on companies. but no pdt, so maybe its worth withdrawing 1k and using it for some quick flips to find my btc wallet faster? should i change anything? is it worth connecting my gaming pc to a mining network? long btc  -happy hodlr assuming planb is correct and bitcoin overshoots the 100k price target in the upcoming bull run to say 200-250k, what is your opinion on the best strategy?:1). hold all your bitcoin and don't sell until 1 million.2.) sell a fraction of your portfolio and cash out, dollar cost averaging from 100-250k, and then take a large fraction of that cash and reinvest when the price corrects by 80% back to 50-75k. you then end up with more bitcoin from the profits for the next cycle. if i have a bitcoin wallet with bitcoin in it is there any way you can transfer that to your bank account or what exactly is it for? can't i or anyone rbf the transaction somehow? how?i've been spending all day and night trying to figure this out. getting very burnt out on it.. please and thank you not that this really needs to be said lol. i did it under a fake account and throw away wallet. services were rendered but spending the cash for such little btc was pointless. i bought 10 contracts at 1.93 each and got like 0.001 btc. noteven sure if it was mined lol maybe this is a stupid question, but i don't want to make any mistake and potentially losing my money. i just updated my electrum wallet to the newest version 4.0.3.when i would take my btc from the exchange, i would copy my address that was on the "receive" tab. now with this update, the address is not there anymore. where can i find it? lets say i want to withdraw some small amount 10$ from site that uses kyc. how safe is withdrawing using lightning regarding tracking and relation to my identity? will it be enough to send it few times through different lightning wallets with different amounts to lose track? i want to play some poker with it and not connect it to my identity. how to mix bitcoin on lightning? are these safe?how do they work, do they hold my coins until its paid off in full?what if something happens to the loan company holding my coins? eg 1 week before its paid in full and they still have all my coins or 1k equivalent of my coins..any input much appreciatedthanks! i would like to hear your opinion , its for an investigation i am doing (sorry if my english its not perfect, spanish is my native language) is bitcoin the most free market thing (asset/store of value/currency/etc.) there is...?

[removed] nearly 1-2 months ago i tried adding my bank account by doing a sepa payment, but coinbase denied verifying my account, but still verify that they actually received the payment. the payment was reversed, but i was not verified. i tried again, same issue. then i contacted support and they requested me to do it once again and include the reference number. once again, payment succesful, but they did not verify my account. then they requested id verification, although i am already verified by passport. i sent in my drivers license front and back, in addition with my bank statements, and once again they denied. then they requested a selfie of me holding a paper saying "for coinbase trading" and the date, which i then did. once again denied. then they requested id documents on a secure platform owned by themselves, and then my id was verified.however, my account has been disabled for deposits on their platform, and i am required to have a verified bank account linked in order to withdraw my funds. they suggested withdrawing by debit card, but my card provider does not offer what they call "instant withdrawal". the last e-mail i received said i am locked from doing any deposits, whereas i am more than welcome to buy bitcoins through my creditcard, what a fucking joke.they obviously have enough evidence of my bank statements, my drivers license, my passport, and my bank account linking to the same name. my account has 2fa, and the funds are obtained from legitimately selling a website. their legal page is not of much help, as it is only for us states, whereas they are operating on european ground.due to their bs. i unfortunately had to drop out of my education as i was required to buy a laptop with high specs, and the funds i had on coinbase was going towards this....&amp;#x200b;does anyone have an idea as for what i can do legally as an european customer on their platform, requesting my fiat funds to be paid.

[removed] [removed] a person who holds a token of value for ten years will value it much more than a person who holds that same token for one year.this is one of bitcoins fundamental value drivers. anybody know of a place outside of coinbase that i can use my us debit for under 5% fee? verification is no problem. seem to all be around 10%+.thanksedit- for the record crypto.com was the place but after they updated their app the card i've been using for years no longer works, so im guessing they switched processors or something? i've heard address reuse is not secure. well now i am worried about my btc address situation and what i need to do to make it more secure.i requested a btc withdrawal to my address, let's call it address x. instead of sending the full amount though, they only sent a small test transaction to address x. once i got the small amount of btc at address x and confirmed it worked, they sent the rest of the btc amount to address x,does this mean my btc holdings are not secure because i received at the same address twice? is there anything i can do to make it more secure?i'm not sure if this makes any difference, but it is a multisig wallet. i signed a message from electrum. if i verify it via electrum it says "signature verified".yet if i try to verify that same message in the online services (i've tried more than one), it never works. either they say that the address is invalid or " message failed to verify!"what's going on? am i missing something? just interested in opening a discussion on what a bitcoin standard would look like or how such a hypothetical could exist in the real world.

[removed] typical affiliate programs and mlm projects have many disadvantages, such as a high likelihood of being cheated for partners.  but in partnership programs based on smart contracts, the situation is different.  all operations are handled by the program code in the blockchain.  it cannot be changed, which means that the author of mlm will not be able to deceive you by adding additional conditions.  moreover, the author of such a project does not own users' money.  money is distributed between the wallet and partners automatically and instantly.  the author of the project, like all users, only receives the agreed deductions.  if anyone wants to know more, please contact me in private messages or in the comments.  smart contracts are the future of financial relationships.

some people are understandably against all ads, and ***if*** they were added, they would be very obviously labelled as an ad. r/cryptocurrency had almost 8 million pageviews last month alone. r/ethtrader has a banner ad for purchase with another community points coin.should we attempt to get companies to do "giveaways" for moons? suppose you needed a certain amount of moons to enter.some of these will be difficult to do before there's a market to trade mainnet moons for other cryptos. thus, this doesn't need to be a rushed conversation. just a thought i had about bitcoin- (or any coin) "-maximalists".on the one hand i hear pretty much all of them stress the importance of free markets and competition.on the other hand, they focus on their coin like it is a religion and trash talk all other coins.isn't this a pretty clear contradiction? if you would want cryptos to succeed as a whole, wouldn't you want as much diversity and free competition as possible between coins, and just let the market figure out over time what works and what doesn't? let multiple coins find and fill whatever big potential and niches there are? you might be interested to know how the process works. if you're not going for the first thing, then you should go with a new one.1. learning how to make money2.what is the best time to get this3. what do i do with the kidsin my room with the same problem i had a couple days. i'd like a little bit of help from you and your mom to make it to your wedding party on saturday and we will have a favourite party on our birthday and i saw that there were some people that had to be in town and was going for the same time [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] -today's crypto of the day is lition (lit), and it's current price is $0.1342.-since 2/18/20, every day i have featured a new crypto of the day for us to discuss. i try to make follow up posts within a week, but i am behind at the moment. i try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. sometimes i even feature projects i personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. i feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. at this point, i plan to try to continue making these posts until i have completed a full year.-if you decide to reply, please add something more than, "scam" or "this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020". please say why. if it is a scam, link or show evidence. if you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential?

[removed] for those of you who buy btc, why don't you buy gbtc? got a trezor. have used it multiple times with no issues. now my pin doesn't work and i'm furious. i'm absolutely certain i'm entering the correct pin and i'm doing it properly. help? [removed] i'm trying to open and fund a gemini account and is the only way to do the initial deposit?  i use td bank and it appears that i would have to make an appointment and go to the bank in order to do this.  i have accounts at multiple other exchanges that have not required this.this seems like a ridiculous requirement just to fund an account.  i already added my bank account info to the account.  why can't i just ach money from there.  i would have posed this in the gemini sub but it seems dead in there.is there a work around or do i just keep using coinbase? it is in this city of khan-balik that the great khan has his mint; and it is so organized that you might well say that he has mastered the art of alchemy. i will demonstrate this to you here and now. you must know that he has money made for him by the following process, out of the bark of trees-to be precise, from mulberry trees (the same whose leaves furnish food for silkworms). the fine bast between the bark and the wood of the tree is stripped off. then it is crumbled and pounded and flattened out with the aid of glue into sheets like sheets of cotton paper, which are all black. when made, they are cut up into rectangles of various sizes, longer than they are broad .... and all these papers are sealed with the seal of the great khan.the procedure of issue is as formal and as authoritative as if they were made of pure gold or silver. on each piece of money several specially appointed officials write other names, each setting his own stamp. when it is completed in due form, the chief of the officials deputed by the khan dips in cinnabar the seal or bull assigned to him and stamps it on the top of the piece of money so that the shape of the seal in vermilion remains impressed upon it. and then the money is authentic. and if anyone were to forge it, he would suffer the extreme penalty. of this money the khan has such a quantity made that with it he could buy all the treasure in the world.with this currency he orders all payments to be made throughout every province and kingdom and region of his empire. and no one dares refuse it on pain of losing his life. and i assure you that all the peoples and populations who are subject to his rule are perfectly willing to accept these pa-pers in payment, since wherever they go they pay in the same currency, whether for goods or for pearls or precious stones or gold or silver. with these pieces of paper they can buy anything and pay for anything.several times a year parties of traders arrive with pearls and precious stones and gold and silver and other valuables, such as cloth of gold and silk, and surrender them all to the great khan. the khan then summons twelve experts, who are chosen for the task and have special knowledge of it, and bids them examine the wares that the traders have brought and pay for them what they judge to be their true value.the twelve experts duly examine the wares and pay the value in the paper currency of which i have spoken. the traders accept it willingly, because they can spend it afterwards on the various goods they buy throughout the great khan's dominions .... let me tell you further that several times a year a fiat goes forth through the towns that all those who have gems and pearls and gold and silver must bring them to the great khan's mint. this they do, and in such abundance that it is past all reckoning; and they are all paid in paper money.by this means the great khan acquires all the gold and silver and pearls and precious stones of all his territories. and all the khan's armies are paid with this sort of money. i have now told you how it comes about that the great khan must have, as indeed he has, more treasure than anyone else in the world. i may go further and affirm that all the world's great potentates put together have not such riches as belong to the great khan alone.

or do you want to spend all the smaller value coins to lighten up your wallet? similar considerations can be made when creating a bitcoin or bitcoin derivative (altcoin) transaction.before the coin control feature was released, all transactions involving bitcoin (and altcoins) automatically selected their coins using the first-in-first-out (fifo) algorithm. this strategy includes the oldest coin in the account, and when the amount is not sufficient the second-oldest coin is added, and so forth.as of ledger live version 2.11.1, users are able to make use of a dedicated coin control tool to choose the coin selection strategy and the coins that may be spent.## using coin control in ledger live[coin control is available in advanced options in the send flow](https://preview.redd.it/l725x6qwejn51.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8eb8adaca4bed2acf0c35678f2aa26feae790fc)1. click on **send**, choose an account to debit, and enter a recipient address. click on **continue**.2. enter an amount and click on **advanced options**. you will then see:\- the currently selected, default coin selection strategy: oldest coins first (fifo).\- a toggle to enable replace-by-fee (rbf).\- a toggle to include coins from unconfirmed, replaceable transactions.3. click on **coin control.** the coin control modal opens.4. select a **coin selection strategy** from the dropdown menu:\- **oldest coins first** (fifo). this is the default strategy that spends the oldest coins first.\- **minimize fees** (optimize size). this strategy tries to minimize the byte size of the transaction by spending the lowest number of utxos. this results in a low network fee.\- **minimize future fees** (merge coins), this strategy includes the maximum number of inputs so that a potential future price rise does not make smaller utxos economically unspendable. if the price of a crypto asset increases too much, small utxos may become worth less than the cost of the network fees to spend them.5. select which coins may not be included in the selection by unticking their checkbox. the **selected** indicator shows which coins will be included in the transaction. by changing the selection strategy and/or coins to include, the user has precise control over which coins end up being spent. the **coins to spend** and **change to return** indicators show how much is spent from and returned to the account.6. click on **done** to return to the **send** flow to verify and send the transaction.[the coin control window lets you select the strategy as well as pick the coins. coins marked selected will be included in the transaction.](https://preview.redd.it/cixyoge1fjn51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffdc34db07c0941a8db7ac712631e226773cba67)## coin status**the following statuses can be displayed for a coin:*** coins received in a transaction with 0 confirmations **without** rbf enabled: **pending*** coins received in a transaction with 0 confirmations **with** rbf enabled: **replaceable*** coins received in a transaction with 1337 confirmations:  **1337 confirmations**by enabling the toggle *include coins from unconfirmed, replaceable transactions*, replaceable transactions can be selected in the coin control screen.## the privacy use caseone of the main use cases for coin control is to protect ones privacy. utxos are, unfortunately, not perfectly fungible due to their unique history on the blockchain. therefore, users may want to spend coins from different sources without mixing them together, because this would indicate to an outside observer of the blockchain that these addresses belong to the same account. for instance, if one were to spend coins bought on a kyc exchange, which are associated with the users identity, together with coins bought anonymously using cash, the anonymous coins could be linked to the users identity.another example would be that you would like to prevent spending a high-value coin for smaller purchases because this would unnecessarily show the person youre paying how much you have. this is similar to not showing the *boulanger* how much is on your bank account when buying a *baguette*.## let us know what you think!we are excited to release this new feature because we think it will fulfill real needs of an important part of our users. this version of ledger live marks an important milestone, but we will continue working on more features that our community wants.so, we invite you to try out coin control in [ledger live](https://ledger.com/ledger-live) and let us know what you think! all feedback is welcome on this thread, on r/ledgerwallet, and you can send suggestions or get help through our [official contact form](https://support.ledger.com/hc/requests/new).we'd like to close out by underlining our commitment to the bitcoin community, and our willingness to build the best wallet ecosystem for newbies as well as for power users.

[removed] here's a 0.493 sat/vb txn i put on mainnet today.  you'll have to use the sochain block explorer to see it though.  i give it a 3% chance of getting confirmed, but we'll wait and see.* [sochain: 9c753076428ec9ae79da919fa227db44a2a28841af3ce38669686141f2590293](https://sochain.com/tx/btc/9c753076428ec9ae79da919fa227db44a2a28841af3ce38669686141f2590293)so last month, [i voiced the unpopular opinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/idg07j/node_operators_please_set_the_minrelaytxfee_to/) that node operators should lower the `minrelaytxfee` setting to allow low-fee txns to propagate more freely throughout the network.  then [i asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/ir5fh1/when_the_mempool_empties_why_dont_miners_mine_the/) why miners weren't mining 0.999 sat/vb txns during idle periods since it should be more profitable than mining no txns at all.  finally i [wrote a node herder](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/isf6xm/a_crappy_little_node_walker_herder/) to walk the network looking for node operators that were running `minrelaytxfee` below the default (1000 sat).  after walking about 26% of the network, turns out about 5% of nodes are allowing low fee txns.so in that vein of discussion, i decided to just sign some low-fee txns and send them to the 5% and see what happens.  to my surprise it showed up on one of the 23 block explorers i tried.  surprisingly, that comes out to about 5% as well.  so hopefully 5% or so of the miners will confirm low fee txns.  we'll see.btw, to do this, this is what i did.1. pair my hw wallet to electrum3. use the `paytomany` electrum api to craft a txn below 1 sat/vb4. import the txn to sign in electrum1. ran a full node with `minrelaytxfee` set to 1 sat3. walked the network to find a good number of low-fee peers5. use bitcoin `addnode` api to herd my node to the low-fee peers i discovered.5. use bitcoin `sendrawtransaction` api to broadcast txnwait and see if it can propagate to a miner and if a miner will accept it.btw, there is a pr to lower the `minrelaytxfee` in core, but it's dragged on for years.  the setting was lowered about every year or so in the early days, but hasn't been touched for many years now. cryptocurrencies are totally illegal here. is there any way i can mine without getting caught?! so there is this website, on which the tos states that they would like me not to automate their service, and doing so will result in a ban and the balance of my account will be forfeited. so my question is, since this is about money, is there any way that i could be prosecuted? and would making money this way be considered illegal? since the website doesn't say that they will prosecute or anything like that.

[removed] **bitcoin stock to flow model is wrong because:**the basis of the entire model assumes that halvings create exponential price increases because miners lose half of their ability to depress price. bitcoin inflation year over year inflation rate is already less than 2%, so whether that rate is 1%, 0.5%, or 0.25%, miners have no tangible effect on price because it's already practically zero. the stock to flow ratio might matter when only 4,000,000/21,000,000 were mined, but with 19,000,000/21,000,000 mined, the introduction of those last two million coins over the span of a hundred years will mean nothing going forward. for all intents and purposes, you are better off assuming bitcoin is already at 21 million and that there are no more coins left to mine.**bitcoin might follow the stock to flow model anyway for the next few years, because one word: demand**the volatility index of bitcoin has been sitting at all time lows for the last year but the price is trending slightly up, usually that's indicative of an asset that is consolidating for a massive breakout. think of bitcoin in 2016 as a good comparison. of course bitcoin does not have a tangible intrinsic value per se, but it has an intangible value and that is: trust. despite being in a nasty multiyear bear market, the on chain metrics for bitcoin have been pointing north the whole time. the people who believe in the fundamentals, the ones who believe in bitcoin are the ones keeping it alive and it's still growing in the background. the global economic circumstances with unlimited quantitative easing are favoring hard assets, and bitcoin is about as hard as it gets. smart money aka institutions and hedge funds are buying bitcoin right now.  usually the entrance of smart money is a sign further appreciation is coming.**this might be bitcoin's last exponential bullrun.** at some point, market capitalization gets so high that it just can't appreciate any more. at 200 billion, the marketcap is already pressing on those limits, but with the increased demand i'm forecasting is coming, i think bitcoin will have one last hurrah to levels in the multi-trillions. unless zimbabwe style hyperinflation is coming, bitcoin will find a ceiling that it will never touch again and peak.

so i transferred some bitcoin from my trezor wallet to coin base, and this the first time i had a transaction take this long, this the first time i transferred out of my trezor, at what point should i be worried. sorry if this is a noob question [removed] [removed] a week or so ago i finally bought into bitcoin trough an exchange. but id be interested in learning more and see what options there are for mining using my own pc (i have cheap electric) any place or videos that would teach me more of the in depth info about bitcoin? so you could say: if bitcoin price goes under/over xxxxx value, yyyyy payment to (sidechain address or other) will send this particular bitcoin (utxo) to (buyer's prespecified address) else the bitcoin utxo reverts back to seller by (expiration date). until the expiration date, the bitcoin utxo will not be spendable due to the timelock.you could use these contracts like automatic cryptocurrency futures.let's say you buy bitcoin at $10k with the intention of selling that particular utxo at $15k. you could buy it and sell it (at a chosen gain) in a single transaction. you would just need to wait for the trigger (like if the price hit $15,000).nobody would program for a loss, like what panic selling creates. this would be built in holding.just a thought. i guess you don't need a new sidechain. i'm not sure. that's why i came here to ask the bitcoin community. does this already exist or could it be a possible innovation?i know exchanges are already doing basically this. is there a way to add this directly into bitcoin and possibly cut out the exchanges? i saw a recent post that contained 3 halving period btc charts; one from 2012 - 2016, another from 2016 - 2020, and the third since the last may halving to the present. it was only a screenshot though, and i'm not very good with excel to do something like that myself.i think it would be fun to follow along and occasionally check in to see if the line chart is making similar post-halving movements over the next few years. anyone know of a free and relatively simple to use tool to overlay line chart periods like this for btc?

[removed] i am relatively new to bitcoin  i have to admit that i thought that bitcoin was a scam / ponzi scheme as many people around me seem to dismiss it and i often hear the words tulips and beanie babies every time someone bring it up. with that saying, i have done quite a bit of homework and i am convinced to become a hodler for at least intermediate term for this halving cycle.now on to the question:how likely is the 51% attack to ever happen?is there an incentive for someone to actually stage a 51% attack? i know that it costs a lot (seem like 20-30 billion usd from what i researched) and the attacker doesnt seem to be able to do anything but double spending  doesnt seem to really be worth doing unless you have at least 10-15 billion usd in bitcoin?so if the price of bitcoin increase substantially, i understand that that the cost of mining will increase substantially as well? (as more miners will jump in?)even then, it seems that the only incentive i can think of is to destroy the creditability of bitcoin without gaining anything much financially?so the most likely candidate is the us government / central banks? but right now the market cap of bitcoin is still small or its probably not really a threat to them yet? but if bitcoins market cap really grow significantly to become a threat, then the cost to stage the 51% attack will grow significantly too?china? russia?thoughts? as the title suggests - im all in on bitcoinbackground: 28 year old with no financial obligations (no house, wife, kids etc). have a stable job working for a hedge fund in london.the way i see bitcoin is essentially an asymmetric risk/reward bet. theres a possibility it doesnt take off from the $10k mark and the price falls indefinitely (for various reasons which we all know).on the flip side we have a number of bullish signals which could realistically 10x the price over the next 5 years.my argument is - with house and equity prices at all time highs, what is my best bet to maximise my income for the future? a provably scarce hard asset that has an enormous network effect and the possibility to grow into a multi trillion market seems like a sensible option.if it all goes wrong then i will cry myself to sleep for a few days and just re-earn it all back in about 2 years.join me brothers....in satoshi we trust. i want to get my dad investing in bitcoin / crypto and he's asked forevidence from respected experienced investors who believe and are investing themselves..testimonials...what's the best approach and resources?he's generally a safe investor (tracker, low yield funds) however after a few wines he's starting to look his pension pot and have a play around [removed] o empresrio jeffbooth, autor do livro price of tomorrow, exalta o bitcoin ([**btc**](https://criptonizando.com/bitcoin-noticias/)) como um investimento obrigatrio em tempos de turbulncia econmica, e afirma que a [**criptomoeda**](https://criptonizando.com/criptomoedas/)  como um bote salva-vidas.parabooth, em meio a dvidas crescentes dos bancos centrais,  preciso ter btc em sua carteira para garantir sua prpria segurana:no h como evitar o colapso final de um boom provocado pela expanso do crdito, declarou, referindo-se s iniciativas recentes dos bancos centrais, para escapar de um enorme problema de dvida adicionando exponencialmente mais dvida.[https://criptonizando.com/2020/09/18/bitcoin-e-bote-salva-vidas-durante-turbulencia-economica-diz-autor-de-price-of-tomorrow/](https://criptonizando.com/2020/09/18/bitcoin-e-bote-salva-vidas-durante-turbulencia-economica-diz-autor-de-price-of-tomorrow/) [removed] [removed] im kinda worried here i just want to make sure i did this properly. i have two calls showing from my eth address. how long will this take to fill and should i have two calls?my first post was removed since i didnt type enough characters so i think this should do the trick.

(btw glorious nation of kazakhstan just invested $700,000,000 in bitcoin mining gear). eventually this pool of existing bitcoin that they're buying from will dry up more and more. that's without even considering the massive effect that the 4 year halving cycle creates.5. at the next halving 31months from now, the amount of new bitcoin created gets cut in half again for the 4th time. this will run the well even drier. let's say grayscale continues to buy the same amount (even though they will definitely keep increasing their investment and other players will join in too). the faster the reserve of already existing bitcoin is getting bought up, the faster the price goes up. the halvings increase this every 4 years.it is an absolute certainty that bitcoin will outperform every alternative investment and one day replace or completely dominate every other type of money.and for the bitcoin scaling issue, the lightning network has already solved that. it does a million transactions per second, and has the capacity to send 10 btc at once, instantly, for a few satoshis (practically free). the bitcoin blockchain will always run right about at capacity. the lightning network has private transactions. how do we know that bitcoin together with bitcoin lightning aren't doing as much business as visa?there is no limit for how high bitcoin will go.compare this with tsla. today they have a p/e ratio of 1145. many will consider this to be overvalued. that limits how high the stock price can go. plus, you can't spend stock. you have to sell it first.bitcoin has no such limits. the price of bitcoin can and will continue to go up exponentially over the long term. as volatility improves, the pace of price increase should increase as well. accelerating acceleration. you never need to sell bitcoin. just spend it, unlike stocks or other financial instruments.eventually, after 6 or 7 more halvenings, bitcoin will have a market cap of higher than the rest of the world's wealth combined. every step is there between here and then. eventually government created fiat money will be nearly entirely worthless by comparison.this halving period will create another bull run as more institutional investors adopt the hold forever strategy. volatility goes down. bitcoin becomes more famous for its performance, draws deeper attention, converts more believers/investors, more people hold forever, bitcoin price goes to infinity with no limit. it's just a matter of time.bitcoin is the most genius thing i've ever seen. i want to buy some bitcoins but i read that some banks aren't crypto tolerant your purchases. how does paypall deal with this? when writing a transaction to the blockchain. you write the input address, who sends the coin, and two output addresses, one who belongs to the recipient, and one who belongs to the sender where the surplus bitcoin will be transferred to, is the output address forced by consensus or is it just a step all wallets decides to do? is it possible to ignore this extra address and have the surplus remain in the original address? start your trading journey today, to boost your borderless marketplace marginsin humanity and trading factors, im most excited ive helped open price levels for numerous binary option traders to have their work taken seriously and begin to make a living from coin trades. i have two methods of seed storage.1) entire words saved.2) first three letters of words savedi was under the impression that either is an acceptable method for seed recovery.i just restored my ledger and much to my utter horror, inputting the first three letters of the words did not determine the word!after inputting the first three letters for most words i had a few choices... i was stunned to say the least.why did i purchase the second method of seed word storage when it seems ultimately useless?what am i doing wrong??

https://www.coininsider.com/bitcoin-atms-are-increasing-at-a-whopping-rate/ statera is an index fund is a fund that can track a specified basket of underlying investments and in this case: btc, eth, link, and snx all "balanced" with sta. these coins are set in the fund at a specified percent so as one goes up or down the others are automatically bought or sold to balance risk and maximize profit.however, the key is that sta is deflationary (whenever a sta transaction happens for buying/selling/pooling, 1% of said transaction is burned). this token burn along with tokens being locked in pools, pressures prices up to again make sure the other coins will be balanced, but also creates arbitrage opportunities across funds.why is increasing volume, liquidity and arbitrage useful with statera?well while pooling statera you earn a percent of all transaction fees in the liquidity pool. please feel free to read the medium article outlining the first 2-3 months which came out to be an apy of 36% creating dividends where there were none (https://medium.com/@stateraproject).the power of sta is that the ripple effect of: (1) compounded fees, (2) token burn, (3) price pulled by balancing with eth, btc, snx and link leads to an exponential effect and positive feedback loop on price. this leads to the concept created by statera known as "volume farming."[bitboys video on sta](https://youtu.be/rrljbe7zuh0) bitcoin has shown me that nothing last for ever. soon bitcoin will be used in paying school fees [removed] [removed] [removed] crypto is clearly booming as an industry so that also means there ill be more jobs created.what roles do you believe well see more of?

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] r/avalanche_ is the name of the cryptocurrency subreddit i have launched, to give the community of people learning about avalanche and avalanche enthusiasts a place to discuss avalanche free from toxicity and negativity.this is an "unofficial" subreddit, in the context of avalanche this means it is not owned or controlled by avalabs, which is the developing force behind the avalanche project.i am already up past 80 members in just a few days of social networking with my peers. i have also written an article about the subreddit, its purpose and origin, and my moderation strategies and philosophies, that you may read if you'd like. this article is posted in the subreddit.###what is avalanche?avalanche is a cryptocurrency based on team rocket's whitepaper *"from snowflake to avalanche"* developed by avalabs, which is headed by the computer scientist emin gn sirer, his cofounders, and a large global team of developers, community managers, and marketing evangelists.avalanche is named after the avalanche protocol, which is a specific and new consensus algorithm detailed in the original whitepaper. in my own words, i would describe it as a gossip/pandemic algorithm for a third-generation blockchain, utilizing multiple rounds of locally-random peer sampling, polling, and pre-state consensus. essentially, this allows for a very fast and efficient consensus algorithm with mathematically sound properties. proof of stake is used as the underlying anti-sybil mechanism.some properties that you may find interesting:1) anyone can run a node. on your laptop, on your rasberry pie, it will all work with very minimum hardware requirements that basically all household computers meet.2) even if everyone runs these lightweight nodes, the avalanche network has proven to process over 4500 tps. this is without high-grade hardware and also without sharding.3) transaction finality is under a second, with few exceptions that never take longer than about three seconds. by transaction finality i mean there is a practical 0% chance your transaction will be reversed, equal to that of around 6 bitcoin confirmations.4) all validating nodes take part in the block-production process, and basically anyone can become a validator. there is no distinction (that i know of) between validating as a full node and validating as a block producer. both are *just validating* and can influence the network.5) the minimum amount of avax you need to validate is 2000, but this is parameterized, which means that the validators periodically are able to vote onchain to incrementally change it. there are other parameterized constants including the expensiveness of transaction fees.avalanche (avax) is also a robust and versatile smart contract chain that is fully equipped with it own virtual machine as well as the ethereum virtual machine. all ethereum applications can be ported over to avalanche with no developer downtime.avalanche (avax) also has this unique and interesting property of inherent cross-chain same-asset atomic swaps, allowing for the creation of subnetworks with custom virtual machines, custom economics, custom anti-sybil mechanisms, basically the full scope of a custom blockchain utilizing the avalanche consensus engine, fully interoperable with avalanche's default chains. you can launch a subnetwork that still uses the avalanche token, or you can launch one with its own token, really the possibilities are super open-ended.avalanche (avax) also has this interesting architecture of being kind of like a hybrid between a blockchain and a dag. this one is hard for me to explain, so i will explain what i do understand. avalanche actually is made of three default blockchains/networks, all synergistically working together and supporting the same native avax token:- the x-chain (exchange-chain) is a utxo chain for avax that allows for the creation of new assets. its the origin / first-parent chain.- the p-chain (platform-chain) is the chain that allows for the creation of new subnetworks. this chain has different architecture than the x-chain, and is also the chain that people running nodes need to interface with to become validators.- the c-chain (contract-chain) which is smart contract chain using the ethereum virtual machine. most smart contracts planned to be built here.finally, a characteristic of avax that i absolutely love is how deflationary it is. its the most deflationary cryptocurrency i have ever heard of. it has a maximum supply cap like bitcoin (720m is max), all fees are burned like in ethereum's eip-1559, and there is incentivized staking that is open to basically everybody. i say the staking is incentivized, because you need to stake and validate in order to run a subnetwork, which can offer rewards (or be a business goal).###what is r/avalanche_?r/avalanche_ is the cryptocurrency subreddit i am launching which allows for clean and open discussion of avalanche as well as other cryptocurrencies. this subreddit focuses primarily on offering a moderated space to discuss avalanche, where personal attacks are not allowed. freedom of belief in opinion is protected, but anything that hurts people or is damaging to the culture of openness and positivity is prohibited and moderated. 99% of all moderation is performed by the moderator, and the other 1% is done by me and anyone else who may later be added to the team.if you are wondering "okay but why you?" i cannot give an adequate response besides "because i care". i would point out that out of the 3000+ people participating in "avalanche hub" (which is avalabs' official incentivized community participation and marketing platform) i am #5 in terms of influence and my community contributions, but i suppose this is a bit anecdotal. i have written many articles in support of avax though, and this is a bit more material. i may share them below.i have gotten a bit sophisticated with the automoderator tool, and i have done this because i want to protect noobs from toxicity and fighting. essentially what i have done is 5 things, and together its created a toxicity neutralizing mechanism thats held up so far:1) an initial vetting process that requires all accounts to have positive comment karma **and** be a week old, have 50 post karma, **or** 25 comment karma. this is a relaxed anti-spam measure. currently parts of this are turned off, but they will be re-enabled in a few days. i did not make this measure too stringent because i want it to be easy for noobs to join and participate.2) a well researched and extensive blacklist of indisputably toxic words, phrases, and domains that trigger instant removal.3) a well researched and extensive greylist of fairly toxic words, phrases, and domains that trigger removal if the poster lacks a certain amount of post karma, comment karma, age, or goes reported.4) a hierarchical and tiered report threshold where non-greylisted comments get removed on x number of reports, based on both post karma and comment karma. the lesser of these two make the weakest link.5) an anti-doxxing protection algorithm which protects against credit cards, phone numbers, emails, and more from being doxxed. i myself have not created this, but i have been modifying it to fit the group.i probably will not have to do any manual moderation aside from updating automoderator to keep it up to date with the lingo of people with bad intentions.it is my belief that culture is absolutely crucial to the health of a project, and for this reason i am using both automated moderation and community moderation to curtail outsider attacks and infighting alike. as soon as the subreddit becomes a bit more active, it will make it easier for me to ask around the community for moderators.###welcome to avalancheall are welcome in the avalanche community. all i ask is that you don't intentionally and maliciously try to make others feel unwelcome. avalanche is a global, decentralized, cryptocurrency and open source software for all to build on and utilize.i am not a gatekeeper, but a mere member of the community which seeks to provide a positive and friendly platform for redditors to social network on. links to relevant and official avalanche community resources are in the "about" section of r/avalanche_.i

true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? it seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags.-i strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. there is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please

[here is a link to download](https://www.sendspace.com/file/5yaa0q) what are all of the reasons you bought bitcoin?here's my list:1. innovation - bitcoin is an entirely new form of wealth. bitcoin is the most valuable digital creation ever, and it's just getting started. bitcoin is unstoppable because of its nature. bitcoin can't be copied.2. monetary policy - i don't even know how to say this correctly, but... i love the issuance schedule of bitcoin. there's a block every ten minutes. every block includes a bribe to the miners to spend electricity. that's called a block reward. it started at 50 btc. then every 210,000 blocks (about 4 years) the reward gets cut in half. this happens 33 times total until all 21,000,000 btc are mined in about the year 2140, at which point the network continues on working forever existing on transaction fees alone.the monetary policy creates a 4 year exponential price cycle. the stock to flow theory explains this more elegantly. gold is valuable because you can't copy it, it's rare, and not much new gold is mined/found each year. it would take 62 years of the current mining rate to mine as much gold as we have today. but bitcoin is different. it is impossible to mine/create as much bitcoin as what already exists today.block 649258 was just mined. that means there exists 18,495,362.5 btc. there's only 2,504,637.5 btc left to mine ever. bitcoin is already more rare than gold.how much longer do you think it's going to take before people catch on and the price goes up because of the network effect?18,495,362.5 btc divided evenly across the planet would be less than 0.0025 btc per person.reason #3: bitcoin has been battle hardened. bitcoin is unhackable at the network level. so if you use bitcoin at the network level with a non custodial bitcoin wallet, then you're pretty solid. probably safer than all the good in your fort knox.so what are your reasons for buying bitcoin? what will you guys do in a event of an emp blast or another war? what if you no longer have internet access how will you access your bitcoin? if an emp takes out your electronics and internet access? [removed] [removed] i was wondering if these points are possible or logical to consider?i was thinking about why hasnt crypto taken over the world by now so i came with some points1. is the amount of currency/coins/tokens- is it possible to adjust the amount of coins based on the value of the coin(for example like in stocks there companies do a split to attract more buyers without creating inflation) you would basically increase the amount of coins and decrease the price (if you had 1btc = $10 and split it to 10btc = $1 or vase versa)and i know that you can have fractional coins, but thats just because of the mental barrier, it would attract more people2. a some sort of a crypto bank that would be integrated into the cryptocurrency that would own like 1/3 of all the available currency and therefore could allow someone to trade regular money into that cryptothat bank would also be able to have a adjustable fee on every transaction (the key here is to start at a higher transaction fee and as time goes on lower the fee until it becomes almost 0) and a % of that fee would go to mining and the rest could go into expanding the availability to peoplethe fee would also enable a 0 interest loan that can also attract people into the cryptocurrency world3. is to create custom addresses for people to remember (like shortened urls) you would type in the custom address and it would convert it to the random address that everybody has can someone please explain to me the way they work?like are they based on the bitcoin core software that supports the bitcoin network/blockchain? i was typing random numbers and letters on site [prnt.sc](https://prnt.sc) and i came to some email. i saw that mail has: [bit-trading.online](https://bit-trading.online) (i think) in his mail. this mail had a informations about some account (i think it's named georgian or smthng). i visited that site and logged in, so, can you get cryptoware from that site?

mstable, a decentralized aggregator lending through compound, aave, and others.what makes this interesting is that trib token is minted on a bonding curve. for every trib minted, the price increases by .000001 musd. as trib is only minted by depositing musd into the contract, **all trib is backed by musd and the contract will buy back trib according to the bonding curve.**now, you may think that bots will quickly claim the interest before you do, and youre probably right, so why should an actual human invest? burning trib tokens dont actually reduce supply. what it does is lock those tokens forever in the protocol in the burn address. as the contract determines the price, and the price is defined by the amount of trib tokens, this has two main side effects:**1) it raises the floor price. which is the lowest a trib token gets to be sold to the contract.****2) it forever locks interest generating musd in the contract.**because the floor price is constantly rising, if you got in at a price lower than the floor, you will never be at a loss.and the musd which is locked in the contract is making sure that there is always money to be offered for someone to interact with the contract**. because you can double your money by claiming interest, there will always be people interacting with the contract, constantly increasing the price and the price floor.**but remember, to claim the interest, you must have trib tokens, so even if everyone sells their tokens tomorrow, someone will still need to buy tokens to claim the interest.and when they do 10% extra will be locked in the contract, making the locked pool bigger, and luring the next person to interact with the contract. wheres the catch? not everyone can be a winner right? of course, but the clever thing about the protocol is that **the loser is the people borrowing money through defi. in the contribute protocol, money is generated through lending money, allowing every participant in the protocol to profit.** the contract already has over $10 million in it, so there is are millions of dollars locked into the contract generating interest forever; the ball is already rolling.more resources:website: [https://tribtoken.com/](https://tribtoken.com/)whitepaper: [https://ipfs.io/ipfs/qmbfkup9jkekc2adxtpp6baxgpuzy89wz5tzpmp7eqdbpp](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/qmbfkup9jkekc2adxtpp6baxgpuzy89wz5tzpmp7eqdbpp)faq: [medium.com/@kentosadim/what-is-tribs-maximum-supply-fd70e8cf8799](https://medium.com/@kentosadim/what-is-tribs-maximum-supply-fd70e8cf8799)contract data, claimable interest, reverves, musd locked forever, floor price and more: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x0ddfe92234b9dca2de799736bbba1d2f25cfc3b8#readcontract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0ddfe92234b9dca2de799736bbba1d2f25cfc3b8#readcontract) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i have googled and searched and i get a lot of hits and ive found some interesting things but im to new in this field to really get a good idea of whats good and whats not legit.so i thought ill ask here, im in the hunt for good and reliable apps and or services that tracks coin prices and where you can setup notifications so i get a phone notification when a set price is reached of a coin.and also good portfolio tracking apps/services.what do people who have some legs in this field recommend ?

[removed] hello guysi trading bitcoin futures (leverage) with binance, i lost too much because i trading random, can anyone tell me how can i read the chart in the right way? following some indicators for short trades?you will really help me to live my lifethank you very much title anyone having an issue linking their samourai wallet with btc payserver? the xpub i put in never seems to generate the correct addresses. [removed] hey there, sorry for my english. i'm looking for an app/program for smartphone/computer that can show bitcoin/euro live graphs even when the app isn't open. i want to fix the graphs to the desktop/monitor so that i can constantly look at them. is there something like that available? thanks in advance for any reply, valerio. #bitcoin the perfect long-term  pennant pattern in log scale (weekly)the fact that #bitcoin is bouncing off of former resistance and potentially turning it into support is extremely bullish imho i normally explain to newcomers the concept of public key and private key as follows: imagine the public key is your email address and the private key is your password.i understand that this is not exactly how it is but it helps newbies to get started.my initial thought was that a private key without public key is worthless since you do not know to which public key it belongs. am i right that i can send money without knowing the corresponding public key? could someone please elaborate? thanks a lot! [removed] someone told me i should only buy and sell bitcoin and send bitcoin directly to my address never anyone elses. which that is a completely right because why the hell would i ever send it to somebody else is wallet ? but why did he say this can you get in trouble for buying bitcoin for somebody else thru coin base ? how can i make my money work for me? it would need to be without kyc.thanks! so i have gigabyte brix mini-pc that isn't currently used for anything so i thought i could make a lightning node out of it. it has 500 gb ssd.how hard is it? what should i install? i have some experience with linux. [removed] as we are publishing this report gold is trading at $1900, silver at $24 per ounce however the digital gold(bitcoin) is hovering around $10400.we have seen a massive sell-off in equities, the precious metal sector and in the crypto assets, last night as renewed economic turmoil and geopolitical uncertainty has created massive panic in the market. the previous fiscal stimulus and the zero percent fed funds rate has been the backbone for the fake rally which we have seen in the equities (excluding tech individual stocks like zoom and amazon) however now as the expectation of new fiscal stimulus is pretty much nil its not surprising to see the plunge in the market. the falling expectations of new stimulus measures, growing uncertainty surrounding the u.s. elections is adding some more pressure to equity markets. the equity market and the economy are not synchronized at the moment however this wouldnt last long and as the threat of a second wave of lockdown measures is weighing on economic growth we expect a severe decline in the equity markets. in recent months, the cryptocurrency has been increasingly correlated with the s&amp;p 500, if the correlation remains intact we could see bitcoin prices to plunge as well along with the more significant decline in the altcoins. we have decided to sell our 40% of the crypto portfolio and convert it into tether(usdt). we would start reallocating on selected altcoins based on our strategies as they would provide immense upside potential in case bitcoin reaches our downside target. its also worth noting that in this kind of environment cash is king and investors prefer it over precious metals. we believe the downside risk in gold is limited while the upside is enormous. we would also recommend investors and traders to focus on silver as it would provide more gains compared to gold in the medium and long term. we do understand that the covid-19 epidemic will end at some point however the economic damage and tremendous loss of lives accompanied by the virus would continue to impact the economy for years if not decades to come. the possibility of the second wave of the virus is also imposing a serious threat for the world economy which could end up increasing the longer-term economic damage from the virus. the uncertainty driven by the pandemic, the influence of covid-19 on global markets, and the global expansion of central-bank balance sheets will ultimately be very positive for gold. i've read this somewhere, but i want to confirm.  say a 2-3 wallet on electrum was created, if i provided the private key of one holder and the public key from another, would  this electrum wallet be able to send transactions? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] -today's crypto of the day is pi network (pi), and it's current price is an untracked listing.-since 2/18/20, every day i have featured a new crypto of the day for us to discuss. i try to make follow up posts within a week, but i am behind at the moment. i try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. sometimes i even feature projects i personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. i feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. at this point, i plan to try to continue making these posts until i have completed a full year.-if you decide to reply, please add something more than, "scam" or "this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020". please say why. if it is a scam, link or show evidence. if you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? it seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags.-i strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. there is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. you may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. i know i certainly did!https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/search?q=author%3ajoenorwood77&amp;restrict_sr=on-these posts are not meant to be financial advice, but instead to be an educational discussion. everyone is responsible for doing their own research. im still hodling enormous, heavy bags of vet, nano, iota, ark, dcr, among others. im looking through cmc and can not find examples of coins that got obliterated like these and eventually turned things around and became a successful project and had decent, steady price rises to recovery. all i see are old dead projects that rose and peaked in dec 2017 but never reached their sat all time high and then continued to bleed afterward. i am talking about pre-2016 coins. does anyone know of any projects that have actually stood the test of time? i am really considering after hodling these projects for 3+ years to just cut my -90% btc losses and just hodl btc since its the only resiliant coin. what do you all think and who has experience in this area? i am just trying to understand how the concept of governance tokens on defi platforms makes any sense over just allowing users to have governance votes based on the liquidity they have provided to the platform.why are arbitrary tokens necessary for this process other than to pump out another pointless shitcoin onto the market?

[removed] wow.that was the most convincing scammer i've ever dealt with. i just received a call from bank of america who wanted me to fill out a form for the cryptocurrency i've been buying on uphold.the woman claimed i needed to verify on a form whether or not i was buying as a business or a individual and said they'd be mailing a form for me to fill out. she knew my email address, my date of birth, and the month i bought crypto from uphold. i dont fucking know how...something felt off so i called boa fraud line and they immediately told me it was not them. just a friendly reminder, bank of america will never ask you to fill out a form just for buying crypto.if something feels off, or even if you question a phone call the smallest bit - go ahead and call your bank. the entire process took less than 5 minutes to verify and it's better to be safe than sorry.fuck scammers.

DOWN //POSTDATACOMPILED// i realize that `bitcoind` has this capability built in, but thought it might be fun to configure it manually.  as some background, most people look at their network and they have some address like `192.168.1.105`.  that is a private network address.  sites like `whatismyipaddress.com` will tell you what your ***external*** ip address is.  when your running a bitcoin node, people will connect to your external ip.problem is... your isp may cycle that ip address every week or so.  `bitcoind` has a nice feature baked in called `discover` which will do the work of guessing your external ip as it changes.  but if you are doing anything where you need to expose your rpc api externally (\*danger\*) then it would be nice to have some fqdn to go after to do the ip translation.originally, i had always solved this by exposing my node as an onion node.  since onion nodes traverse nats and firewalls fairly effortlessly this was an easy option.but previously i had played around with dynamic dns service.  i've used `noip.com` but there are likely dozens of services out there that will get the job done.once you have enabled a noip hostname, you can name it in your `bitcoin.conf` using the `externalip=coolbtcnode.ddns.net`.  then, assuming you setup all the rpc auth and port forwarding, you could access your node via rpc at `coolbtcnode.ddns.net`as i said... it's a redundancy, since `discover=1` does most of this for you, but still thought someone might enjoy the tip.* [linux noip setup (old post)](https://brianddk.github.io/darkweb/2018/09/22/install-noip.html)* [windows noip setup](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/installing-the-windows-4-x-dynamic-update-client-duc/)* [windows full node tor/onion setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/iscd2e/psa_enable_tor_as_a_simple_way_to_make_your_node/) [removed] been looking for an site with historical data pre 2014 and an api. is there any? mt gox was launched in 2010, there should be a chart contanig prices from as far as when bitcoin first got an "official" price right? sooo before it was traceable someone invested a billion in bitcoin on facebook. it was a few years ago, anyone out there know how that was used in the facebook market although i just assumed it was a fbi flood... just wondered what fellow hodlers thoughts are. bitcoin seems to track the stock market, particularly when it dips. im personally of the belief that the us stock market is a bubble and that it will invariably burst at some point.are many people here prepared for the ride thatll take places in the days, weeks and months that will follow the crash? i've been offered to do a webinar on "blockchain". though i believe the real revolution is in decentralization, not enterprise blockchains.for this reason i wanted to know some of the latest and greatest innovation in bitcoin happening right now.some i've head of are: taproot, confidential transactions, schnorr's signature.. i'm finally deciding to properly secure my coins with a hardware wallet. is there anything i should know before making a purchasing decision? any brands to avoid?

genuine question. i want to go all een. i would like to learn more about non-monetary use of bitcoin/ bitcoin network. i undestand that it can be used for timestamping. any other use cases? any intresting resources about this topis?thanks! so i have all my collage money saved up in bitcoins that i am probably going to convert into cash next year and probably after that chances are i am not going to be coming back to bitcoins for a long timethis is the reason why i dont wanted to buy a hard walletso right now all my bitcoins is stored in brd wallet on my ipadalso my ipad is not linked with any apple id or icloud also its not jailbroken and i barely use it or download anything on iti wrote 12 word recovery phrase and kept it inside my safeis there anything else i need to do to keep my fund safe? hi there,does anyone know the legal/tax status in the uk for companies that want to do what microstrategy did, basically buy some btc to have as reserve?&amp;#x200b;many thanks! i have an electrum account and a cash app account(thats in the middle of a verification process to send and receive to it.) i want to buy the denomination then turn around and spend it on a clear net website the same day. my question is 1. whats a good place to buy the coin and get it sent to my address, and 2. does electrum have a hold time to be able to spend it? coin-base say 7 days man and thats just ridiculous. can someone point me in the right direction. i just want to buy the amount i want. without crazy fees then spend it within an hour. is it ok to just start using your full node, even though servers still have your balances etc from before, or should you do a coinjoin and make a new seed?

[removed] there is a tendency to accumulate btc in the cryptomarket, according to delphi digital analysts. they found that this year the time horizons of digital coin holders have increased.in 2020, bitcoin is in a more stable upward trend than last year, according to a new report by the analytical company delphi digital. experts have found that this year the balances of cryptocurrency exchange wallets continued to fall, despite the rise in the price of the main digital coin. this suggests that traders and investors, selling the asset, put less pressure on its quotes, cointelegraph.**this indicates a more stable upward trend in bitcoin compared to 2019. the data indicate that the time horizons of crypto holders have increased,  experts believe.**over the past 6 months, the balance of crypto-exchange wallets has fallen from a historical high of 2.96 million btc in late february to 2.59 million btc in mid-september. then the cryptocurrency was traded at the level of $9580, now it costs $10,430. delphi digital emphasized that when the rate of crypto is growing and its stocks on the stock exchanges are decreasing, it indicates a tendency to accumulate an asset. hithank you for connectingi want to let you know that we have an investor who is willing and ready to invest in any viable project/ business with you acting as the manager and sole controller of the funds while he remains a silent investor for a period of 1-10 years.the amount available for funding is a min of us$200,000 to a max of us$2,000,000,000.00 for business and cooperate loans and it will be coming as a loan.the interest rate will be (3%) per annum.for more information..write us on info@trustsave.online#stay_safe https://bitcoinist.com/heres-why-bitcoins-recent-1000-drawdown-isnt-entirely-bearish/ i've been looking through posts to find an answer (because i feel like this has probably been discussed), but i haven't found one.  feel free to link me.&amp;#x200b;i have to trace two bitcoin transactions.  one went to a poloiex wallet (back when it was poloniex), and one went to a bittrex wallet and i'm not sure which is which.  the exchanges. have been less than helpful and companies like ciphertrace and chainalysis are prohibitively expensive since they're around to do large-scale work.&amp;#x200b;so where does someone like me go to get this done?&amp;#x200b;thanks hi guys, i am new to bitcoins. i am planning to buy a ledger nano s to start my journey :dbinance seem to be a good exchange platform and i am gonna use it.however, when i check on the ledger website, their supported crypto is listed like below&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/56f67c1wxto51.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d0a8148f0676cba98b951bc969aec47e3e5f6cdas you guys can see, for example, the btc's supported wallets are ledger live and electrum.my question is if i have btc on binance, can i manage my btc on binance wallet with my ledger nano? hey there,let's assume that i did some work online and got paid $100 btc . the guy sent me money directly to my btc wallet.however, no tax charges were cut in-between the transaction unlike bank transfer.so will my btc would be considered as illegal?sorry for the noob question.

"between now and the election, volatility stays high and risk gets taken off."&gt;&gt;and as investors are taking some bets off the table, it could lead the market lower. in other words, investors should be cautious.&gt;&gt;"there will be a time to buy stocks again," but that time might not be now, novogratz said on the cnn business digital live show [*markets now*](https://www.cnn.com/specials/investing/markets-now).&gt;&gt;the volatility might persist even after the election, at least in the short-term. a democratic white house could lead to higher taxes, which in turn could lead to a selloff, novogratz -- who expects a biden win -- said. even though democratic administrations historically outperform republican ones, there still could be a knee-jerk reaction on wall street, he added.&gt;&gt;but not to worry, there is a hedge against all sorts of risks in the global economy, novogratz said: "the average investors should have 1-3% of their holdings in bitcoin, it's an amazing hedge," he said.

even 2000 sats/vb. why is that? are there actually wallets out there that puts such a large fee or are miners trying to influence fee estimators to suggest a higher than necessary fees for their own gain?if you look at the picture below, most transactions in mempool are like 8 sat/vb while the biggest fee is 500. yesterday night was worse where highest fees where upwards of 2000 s/vb. and one a

hours sometimes days before the transfer is confirmed, does that mean that the hardware wallet must be connected all the time? or do i only make the withdrawal and then disconnect the ledger?best

aware of the possible swings in bitcoins price and is ready to sell at a moments notice.safety amid an economic downturnearlier this week, michael saylor, microstrategys chief executive, sat for aninterviewwith bloomberg, where he spoke about the firms shocking move to hold over $400 million in bitcoin. there, he explained that they see bitcoin as a safer asset, especially compared to cash and gold.saylor explained in part that he chose to make the move to bitcoin because he had seen the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on traditional assets. before the pandemic hit, the firm had about $500 million in assets, which it had invested primarily in short-term government securities.sadly, the pandemic caused yields on the securities to tumble, and saylor knew that the company had to move into something more reliable.once the real yield on our treasury got to more than negative 10%, we realized that everything we are doing on p&amp;l is irrelevant. we really felt we were on a $500 million melting ice cube, he said.the company eventually found the safety it sought with bitcoin. in july, microstrategyannouncedin a formal announcement that it had switched its primary asset base to the leading cryptocurrency, purchasing about 21,454 btc for $250 million. among other things, the virginia-based tech giant highlighted that bitcoin had proven itself a dependable store of value.in the weeks since then,microstrategyhas doubled down. in afilingwith the securities and exchange commission (sec), it confirmed that it could purchase even more of the asset. however, that would only happen after assessing its cash needs and business strategy.just business for microstrategydays later, the companypurchasedan additional 17,000 btc tokens  bringing its total bitcoin haul to about $425 million.considering that it is putting a lot of its eggs in the crypto basket, bloomberg was curious about whether saylor was worried about bitcoins famed volatility and how much a sharp price drop could gut his firm.however, saylor brushed off any concerns. in part, he said:we can liquidate it any day of the week, any hour of the day. if i needed to liquidate $200 million of bitcoin, i believe i could do it on a saturday.saylor added that the assets volatility isnt much of a problem as he could quickly move away from it and get the companys money back. the ceo also pointed out that he wasnt committing to bitcoin as a passion project. he noted that his firms decision to buy the asset was merely due to its proven stability over the past few months, and he would liquidate his companys holdings if he saw some other alternative assets with greater yields.for now, however, saylor is all-in on bitcoin. the ceo further predicted that more companies would make similar moves, adding that private companies are currently in the right position. zero customer support, 404 guide pages on the website, several bank card selfies rejected, and infinite fees compared to atm withdrawal or sepa transfer.next time, i'll run a bitcoin node on my computer.

[removed] hey all,was just wondering what is the best way to send large amounts of btc to a hardware wallet for security ? would it be best to generate multiple receiving addresses from your hw wallet and split up the btc to send to each of these addresses? or should i just send it all in one transaction after verifying that the receiving address is correct ?thanks for all suggestions . been reading the works of a few monetary theorists and i've been wondering about how a few things would work.the printing of fiat currency by countries across the globe due to covid is in the view of monetary economics, a feature and not a bug. the ability to make money out of thin air is a powerful instrument that when used judiciously, i.e. ensuring the highest multiplier effect by making sure the currency is immediately spent and continues to be spent without adding to savings, can spur the economy without inflation.this is practically impossible as far as i understand with bitcoin or any crypto currency with a cap on availability.in a scenario such as covid, what kind of instruments/measures do you see being deployed in an economy that only has bitcoin? bonus points if the situation is such that the economy is in debt without reserves of bitcoin.going further, how would debt and deficit work? if nations start maintaining reserves of bitcoin, e.g. to avert a crisis or to balance fiscal deficit, wouldn't that inflate the value of bitcoin available in circulation? bitcoin is a completely new board game. its a new accounting system. it is the most sound form of money ever invented and incentivizes authenticity, honesty, and good faith behavior at its most basic layer.of course, humans can and will try to abuse and cheat the system, but bitcoin has a way of snuffing out bad behavior pretty efficiently.people believe this about bitcoin. that is why it is valued so highly..... the usd price is just a symptom of that belief. i recently received the 6174-a letter and i realize that this is about as soft a notification as it gets, but i still want to do my due diligence and be prepared. my question is what exactly my reporting responsibility is if i am not buying cryptocurrency as an investment but exclusively to use as a currency? whenever i purchase btc it is to make a purchase from a webstore or to use at several local businesses to minimize use of bank cards. i rarely have any btc i purchase for longer than 24-hours before spending it as i buy the specific amounts needed.some additional pertinent information, perhaps. my income has not been high enough to owe taxes in over five years due to mental health problems; this includes all forms of income such as any potential capital gains which would be negligible or potentially even losses. i am supported by my parents but they do not claim me as a dependent. finally, if i were to ever need records  of my transactions, the wallet i have used almost exclusively for the last several years, rahakott, no longer exists.any information or ponderings are appreciated. this has really been spinning out my panic disorder since getting the letter even though it seems benign for the most part from a logical perspective. price fluctuations in the bitcoin spot rate on cryptocurrency exchanges are driven by many factors.volatility is measured in traditional markets by the volatility index, also known as the cboevolatility index (vix). more recently, a volatility index for bitcoin has also become available. known as the bitcoin volatility index, it aims to track the volatility of the world's leading digital currency by market cap over various periods of time.bitcoin's value has been historically quite volatile. in a three-month span from october of 2017 to january of 2018, for instance, the volatility of the price of bitcoin reached to nearly 8%. this is more than twice the volatility of bitcoin in the 30-day period ending january 15, 2020. but why is bitcoin so volatile? here are just a few of the many factors behind bitcoin's volatility.## bad news hurts adoption ratenews events that scare bitcoin users include geopolitical events and statements by governments that bitcoin is likely to be regulated.bitcoin's early adopters included several bad actors, producing headline news stories that produced fear in investors.headline-making bitcoin news over the decade or so of the cryptocurrency's existence includesthebankruptcy of mt.goxin early 2014 and, more recently, that of the south korean exchange yapianyoubit. other news stories which shocked investors include the high-profile use of bitcoin in drug transactions via silk road that ended with the fbi shutdown of the marketplace in october 2013.allthese incidents and the public panic that ensued drove the value of bitcoins versus fiat currencies down rapidly.however, bitcoin-friendly investors viewed those events as evidence that the market was maturing, driving the value of bitcoins versus the dollar markedly back up in the short period immediately following the news events.## bitcoin's perceived value swaysone reason why bitcoin may fluctuate against fiat currencies is the perceived store of value versus the fiat currency.bitcoin has properties that make it similar to gold.it is governed by a design decision by the developers of the core technology to limit its production to a fixed quantity of 21 millionbtc.since that differs markedly from fiat currency, which is dynamically managed by governments who want to maintain low inflation, high employment, and satisfactory growth through investment in capital resources, as economies built with fiat currencies show signs of strength or weakness, investors may allocate more or less of their assets into bitcoin.## uncertainty of future bitcoin's valuebitcoin volatility is also driven in large part by varying perceptions of the intrinsic value of the cryptocurrency as a store of value and method of value transfer.a store of value is the function by which an asset can be useful in the future with some predictability.a store of value can be saved and exchanged for some good or service in the future.a method of value transfer is any object or concept used to transmit property in the form of assets from one party to another.bitcoins volatility at the present makes it a somewhat unclear store of value, but it promises nearly frictionless value transfer. as a result, we see that bitcoin's value can swing based on news events much as we observe with fiat currencies.## large currency holder risksbitcoin volatility is also to an extent driven by holders of large proportions of the total outstanding float of the currency.for bitcoin investors with current holdings above around $10m, it is not clear how they would liquidate a position that large into a fiat position without severely moving the market. indeed, it may not be clear how they would liquidate a position of that size in a short period of time at all, as most cryptocurrency exchanges impose 24-hour withdrawal limits far below that threshold.bitcoin has not reached the mass market adoption rates that would be necessary to provide option value to large holders of the currency.## security breaches cause volatilitybitcoin can also become volatile when the bitcoin community exposes security vulnerabilities in an effort to produce massive open source responses in the form of security fixes.this approach to security is paradoxically one that produces great outcomes, with many valuable open source software initiatives to its credit, including linux.bitcoin developers must reveal security concerns to the public in order to produce robust solutions.it was a hack that drove the yapianyoubit to bankruptcy, while many other cryptocurrencies have also made headlines for being hacked or having stashes of cryptocurrencies stolen. as an early example, in april 2014, the openssl vulnerabilities attacked by the heartbleed bug and reported by google security's,neel mehta,drove bitcoin prices down by 10% in a month.bitcoin and open source software development are built upon the same fundamental premise that a copy of the source code is available to users to examine.this concept makes it the responsibility of the community to voice concerns about the software design, just as it is the responsibility of the community to come to consensus about modifications to that underlying source code as well. because of the open conversation and debate regarding the bitcoin network, security breaches tend to be highly publicized.## high-profile losses raise fearit is worth noting that the aforementioned thefts and the ensuing news about the losses had a double effect on volatility.they reduced the overall float of bitcoin, producing a potential lift on the value of the remaining bitcoin due to increased scarcity.however, overriding this lift was the negative effect of the news cycle that followed.notably, other bitcoin gateways looked to the massive failure at mt. gox as a positive for the long term prospects of bitcoin, further complicating the already complex story behind the currencys volatility.as early adopting firms were eliminated from the market due to poor management and dysfunctional processes, later entrants learn from their errors and build stronger processes into their own operations, strengthening the infrastructure of the cryptocurrency overall.## high-inflation nations and bitcoinsbitcoins use case as a currency for developing countries that are currently experiencing high inflation is valuable when considering the volatility of bitcoin in these economies versus the volatility of bitcoin in usd.bitcoin is much more volatile versus usd than the high-inflation argentine peso versus the usd.that being said, the near frictionless transfer of bitcoins across borders makes it a potentially highly attractive borrowing instrument for argentineans, as the high inflation rate for peso-denominated loans potentially justifies taking on some intermediate currency volatility risk in a bitcoin-denominated loan funded outside argentina.similarly, funders outside argentina can earn a higher return under this scheme than they can by using other debt instruments, denominated in their home currency, potentially offsetting some of the risks of exposure to the high inflation argentine market.## tax treatment lifts volatilityaccording to the internal revenue service (irs), bitcoin is actually considered an asset for tax purposes. this has had a mixed impact on bitcoin's volatility. on the upside, any statement recognizing the currency has a positive effect on the market valuation of the currency.conversely, the decision by the irs to call it property had at least two negative effects.the first was the added complexity for users who want to use it as a form of payment. under the new tax law, users would have to record the market value of the currency at the time of every transaction, no matter how small.this need for record keeping can understandably slow adoption as it seems to be too much trouble for what it is worth for many users.secondly, the decision to call the currency a form of property for tax purposes may be a signal to some market participants that the irs is preparing to enforce stronger regulations later.very strong regulation of the currency could cause the adoption rate of the currency to slow to the point where it is not able to achieve the mass adoption that is critical for its overall utility in society.recent moves by the irs are not clear as to their signaling motives and therefore have mixed signals to the market for bitcoin. **good day everyone, our little baby ( grayson ) was diagnosed with the rare congenital heart disease.

with the bitcoin rabbi](https://noded.org/podcast/noded-0720-with-the-bitcoin-rabbi/), the bitcoin rabbi talked about how he made, for experimental reasons, a 15-of-15-multisig-wallet with 14 of his friends.this got me thinking about secure long term storage of funds.multi-sig is the way to go. and usually i'd say something like a 3-of-5 or 2-of-3 setup, where all keys are on permanently offline media (paper, hardware wallet, permanently offline laptop,...).but how much less secure would something like this be in comparison?**alice's 6-of-10 setup between her, bob and charlie.*** smartphone

same group, they would simply have their own banksafe with a different wallet in there.why is this stupid? what's up everybody? how is everyone's doing!i didn't really wanted to lose my time and put effort on a text that most likely will be ridiculed by many and most likely will be ignored, but i have to do it for so many reasons because world really is f'ed up place on our era, and heroes are the ones who are poor and try to put themselves on someone's else shoes and struggles of life.i came to know about bitcoin not more than a month ago, and since then i've been hyped watching videos behind bitcoin's technology, how it runs, how it works and how is created,, bitcoin's documentaries etc etc... hyped watching bitcoin wallets like top 100 etc etc.unfortunately from where i come from, saving money is a big problem because an average educated person with a diploma can not get paid more than 350$ a month, and me sitting without no college due to not having the monetary wills to pursue one, i work more than 9-5 as a modern slave for less than 250$ off taxes. however, i invested and went all in on bitcoin, and my lifesaving didn't really matter to much wether bitcoin was sitting on 15k,10k or 5k, cuz all i had on fiat didn't even bought me 0.05 of bitcoin at 10k\[when i bought in\], so i fomo-ed in.now i'm literally living like a gypsy, lost my work from the plandemic and i'm trying hard to find something else so i can provide my family making ends meet and providing food on the table.i'm the only man in the house coming from a broken family, 'dad' left me and my mom when i was just 1, so pretty much my childhood is having no childhood, and puberty was nothing but trouble after trouble cuz i was dumb wanting to see my self having riches. however, that period of my life is over and i'm glad it is, i converted on the religion of islam while serving jail sentence in the minorities section for drug dealing\[weed to be specific\]. i was only 15 nearly 16 when i was caught.back to bitcoin, not long ago youtube messed up algorithm suggested me a video of davincij15 titled' buy just 1$ worth of bitcoin' and i really loved his speech, so after the video ended i went googling' about bitcoin and i see it's price being around 10.9-11k.i felt the most unluckiest person ever. i wished i never clicked that video!now i've been having sleepless nights overthinking to my self that \[at what cave i've been sleeping in since 2008\] when bitcoin was published by nakamoto through white paper.but my hopes were revived, when i finally got in touch with davinci, and i spoke with him via text messages and also via video calls, asking him as man to man for any fraction of bitcoin if possible a whole one to pay him back with the same amount of bitcoin after the next bull run if giving away any bitcoin was any big deal for him. i explained to him and opened my heart hoping he would've understood what 1$ of his investment had the potential not only to change my life, but also for the generation that is yet to come. i explained to him how valuable bitcoin was in my eyes, and i wouldn't sell cuz i lived poorly most of my life i wouldn't mind living another decade like so.but davinci showed me that humanity is loong-gone!he showed me how f'ed up humans of nowdays are, greedy, selfish and the worst virtues a human being can have.i appreciate his effort on yelling at people to invest on bitcoin since back than, but i found it hard to accept how someone who might own more than 10.000 bitcoin find it so difficult to revive someone's life on the nowadays societies with something ridiculous of his early investment.i'm really in a desperate mode, not only because bitcoin is expensive, but also from the humans that exist today. had i been an early investor, i have no doubt in my mind i would've helped people like me that come from third world countries and have not much to invest on bitcoin.. to people like me, who see the next peak of bitcoin at 200k+, 1 bitcoin that can change 2 generations on where i live.however,i've lost my faith in humanity so i'm not writing all of this to be a 'begger' or whatever of what some of you might call me. the only reason i'm writing this long sh!t, is because i need some advice, i need some counseling with other people who at least can understand from where i'm standing. in the last six months alone, to fight the "virus," canada has set up a benefit  that pays $500 per week for every single canadian affected by the virus (8m+ people, kids aren't affected and old people still get their pension plan, etc).it also set up programs that:a) pay up to 50% of rent and municipal taxes for businessb) subsidizes up to 90% of a company's wages if it had to close due to virusc) double the tax credit for millions of familiesd) extended deadlines to pay taxes, removed fees and intereste) other programs to "help" canadians through the pandemic.total cost of that program? 275b cad. that's $10,000 for every. single. canadian.of course, taxes for the year are plumetting as people are working less, buying less (sales taxes), businesses are closed, etc.where did they take take that money then? well, they pretty much just printed. our debt went from $750b to over a trillion.and here's the kicker:**this program is about to be renewed for one. full. year.**yes, you read that right. this program will now last well into 2021. how many more billions you ask?so, what does this have to do with bitcoin? well, $275b is basically $200b usd. that's the entire market cap of bitcoins, right there.**in six months, canada, one country, "invented" more money out of thin air than the entire market cap of bitcoins. and that is just one, small, almost irrelevant country of 33m people!**of course, by now, you got that bitcoins, unlike canadian dollar, us dollar, euros (another mess with greece btw), cannot be printed ad vitae eternam.when you consider that simple fact, you know that bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency and pretty much the only crypto that everyone will always accept, forever, is undervalued. it's bound to go up long term because unlike cash, it cannot be printed out of thin air.even better, most of bitcoins has already been printed. there's less than 3m bitcoins left over the next 100 years.with that being said, i absolutely refuse to believe bitcoin is not worth $100,000+ per year. as long as people choose to accept it, and more and more people choose to accept it (today someone insisted on being paid with it and gave me a discount over paying in usd), it's bound to go up, period, if only because governments are stupid and print infinite money, forever.why is printing money bad, you ask? well, let's face this: the value of a dollar has gone down 99% in the last 50 years. what can a dollar even buy today? in 1950, my grandfather earned something like $50 a week and could still afford a house, a car, and his wife stayed home. today, ten times that amount is not even enough to afford half of that.canada printing so much cash is bound to devalue its currency. prices will go up around the board. i remember a big mac being $2 as a regular price, now it's $3 on sale a few times per year, and $6.49 the rest of the time. what's it going to cost in 5 years, $10?all in all, bitcoin is truly revolutionary because the government cannot bullshit its way out of any situation by printing money. it will go up as currencies go down. and if you ever think bitcoin is overpriced, remember that in six months, one small (in terms of population) country printed more than the entire market cap of bitcoins.thank you for listening to me. instead of buying bitcoin then use a submarineswap service. is there a service where i can buy satoshi directly with fiat? as requested by /u/estradata here: https://old.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/iylou9/what_are_some_of_the_latest_innovations_in_the/g6heez1/it is a general issue that crops up at the extremes of cryptography, with quantum breaks being just one of the extremes of (classical) cryptography.computational vs information-theoretic--------------------------------------the dichotomy is between *computationally infeasible* vs *informationally-theoretic infeasible*.  basically:* something is *computationally infeasible* if it could in theory be done, but you would not be able to build a practical computer to do it within the age of the universe and using only the power available in just one galaxy or thereabouts.* something is *informationally-theoretic infeasible* if even if you had any arbitrarily large amount of time, space, and energy, you cannot do it.quantum breaks represent a possible reduction in computational infeasibility of certain things, but not information-theoretic infeasibility.for example, suppose you want to know what 256-bit preimages map to 256-bit hashes.  in theory, you *just* need to build a table with 2^256 entries and start from 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 and so on.  this is computationally infeasible, but not information-theoretic infeasible.however, suppose you want to know what preimages, of ***any*** size, map to 256-bit hashes.  since the preimages can be of any size, after finishing with 256-bit preimages, you have to proceed to 257-bit preimages.  and so on.  and there is no size limit, so you will literally ***never*** finish.  even if you lived forever, you would not complete it.  this is information-theoretic infeasible.commitments-----------how does this relate to confidential transactions?  basically, every confidential transaction simply hides the value behind a homomorphic commitment.  what is a homomorphic commitment?  okay, let's start with commitments.  a commitment is something which lets you hide something, and later reveal what you hid.  until you reveal it, even if somebody has access to the commitment, they cannot reverse it to find out what you hid.  this is called the "hiding property" of commitments.  however, when you **do** reveal it (or "open the commitment"), then you cannot replace what you hid with some other thing.  this is called the "binding property" of commitments.for example, a hash of a preimage is a commitment.  suppose i want to commit to something.  for example, i want to show that i can predict the future using the energy of a spare galaxy i have in my pocket.  i can hide that something by hashing a description of the future.  then i can give the hash to you.  you still cannot learn the future, because it's just a hash, and you can't reverse the hash ("hiding").  but suppose the future event occurs.  i can reveal that i did, in fact, know the future.  so i give you the description, and you hash it and compare it to the hash i gave earlier.  because of preimage resistance, i cannot retroactively change what i hid in the hash, so what i gave must have been known to me at the time that i gave you the commitment i..e. hash ("binding").homomorphic commitments-----------------------a *homomorphic* commitment simply means that if i can do certain operations on preimages of the commitment scheme, there are certain operations on the commitments that would create similar ("homo") changes ("morphic") to the commitments.  for example, suppose i have a magical function `h()` which is a homomorphic commitment scheme.  it can hide very large (near 256-bit) numbers.  then if `h()` is homomorphic, there may be certain operations on numbers behind the `h()` that have homomorphisms after the `h()`.  for example, i might have an operation `&lt;+&gt;` that is homomorphic in `h()` on `+`, or in other words, if i have two large numbers `a` and `b`, then `h(a + b) = h(a) &lt;+&gt; h(b)`.  `+` and `&lt;+&gt;` are different operations, but they are homomorphic to each other.for example, elliptic curve scalars and points have homomorphic operations.  scalars (private keys) are "just" very large near-256-bit numbers, while points are a scalar times a standard generator point `g`.  elliptic curve operations exist where there is a `&lt;+&gt;` between points that is homomorphic on standard `+` on scalars, and a `&lt;*&gt;` between a scalar and a point that is homomorphic on standard `*` multiplication on scalars.for example, suppose i have two large scalars `a` and `b`.  i can use elliptic curve points as a commitment scheme: i can take `a &lt;*&gt; g` to generate a point `a`.  it is hiding since nobody can learn what `a` is unless i reveal it (`a` and `a` can be used in standard ecdsa private-public key cryptography, with the scalar `a` as the private key and the point `a` as the public key, and the `a` cannot be derived even if somebody else knows `a`).  thus, it is hiding.  at the same time, for a particular point `a` and standard generator point `g`, there is only one possible scalar `a` which when "multiplied" with `g` yields `a`.  so scalars and elliptic curve points are a commitment scheme, with both hiding and binding properties.now, as mentioned there is a `&lt;+&gt;` operation on points that is homomorphic to the `+` operation on corresponding scalars.  for example, suppose there are two scalars `a` and `b`.  i can compute `(a + b) &lt;*&gt; g` to generate a particular point.  but even if i don't know scalars `a` and `b`, but i do know ***points*** `a = a &lt;*&gt; g` and `b = b &lt;*&gt; g`, then i can use `a &lt;+&gt; b` to derive `(a + b) &lt;*&gt; g` (or equivalently, `(a &lt;*&gt; g) &lt;+&gt; (b &lt;*&gt; g) == (a + b) &lt;*&gt; g`).  this makes points a homomorphic commitment scheme on scalars.confidential transactions: a sketch-----------------------------------this is useful since we can easily use the near-256-bit scalars in secp256k1 elliptic curves to easily represent values in a monetary system, and hide those values by using a homomorphic commitment scheme.  we can use the hiding property to prevent people from learning the values of the money we are sending and receiving.now, in a proper cryptocurrency, a normal, non-coinbase transaction does not create or destroy coins: the values of the input coins are equal to the value of the output coins.  we can use a *homomorphic* commitment scheme.  suppose i have a transaction that consumes an input value `a` and creates two output values `b` and `c`.  that is, `a = b + c`, i.e. the sum of all inputs `a` equals the sum of all outputs `b` and `c`.  but remember, with a homomorphic commitment scheme like elliptic curve points, there exists a `&lt;+&gt;` operation on points that is homomorphic to the ordinary school-arithmetic `+` addition on large numbers.  so, confidential transactions can use points `a &lt;*&gt; g` as input, and points `b &lt;*&gt; g` and `c &lt;*&gt; g` as output, and we can easily prove that `a &lt;*&gt; g = (b &lt;*&gt; g) &lt;+&gt; (c &lt;*&gt; g)` if `a = b + c`, without revealing `a`, `b`, or `c` to anyone.pedersen commitments--------------------actually, we cannot just use `a &lt;*&gt; g` as a commitment scheme in practice.  remember, bitcoin has a cap on the number of satoshis ever to be created, and it's less than 2^53 satoshis, which is fairly trivial.  i can easily compute all values of `a &lt;*&gt; g` for all values of `a` from 0 to 2^53 and know which `a &lt;*&gt; g` corresponds to which actual amount `a`.  so in confidential transactions, we cannot naively use `a &lt;*&gt; g` commitments, we need pedersen commitments.if you know what a "salt" is, then pedersen commitments are fairly obvious.  a "salt" is something you add to e.g. a password so that the hash of the password is much harder to attack.  humans are idiots and when asked to generate passwords, will output a password that takes less than 2^30 possibilities, which is fairly easy to grind.  so what you do is that you "salt" a password by prepending a random string to it.  you then hash the random string + password, and store the random string --- the salt --- together with the hash in your database.  then when somebody logs in, you take the password, prepend the salt, hash, and check if the hash matches with the in-database hash, and you let them log in.  now, with a hash, even if somebody copies your password database, the can't get the password.  they're hashed.  but with a salt, even techniques like rainbow tables make a hacker's life even harder.  they can't hash a possible password and check every hash in your db for something that matches.  instead, if they get a possible password, they have to prepend *each* salt, hash, then compare.  that greatly increases the computational needs of a hacker, which is why salts are good.what a pedersen commitment is, is a point `a &lt;*&gt; h`, where `a` is the actual value you commit to, plus `&lt;+&gt;` another point `r &lt;*&gt; g`. `h` here is a second standard generator point, different from `g`.  the `r` is the salt in the pedersen commitment.  it makes it so that even if you show `(a &lt;*&gt; h) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; g)` to somebody, they can't grind all possible values of `a` and try to match it with your point --- they *also* have to grind `r` (just as with the password-salt example above).  and `r` is much larger, it can be a true near-256-bit number that is the range of scalars in secp256k1, whereas `a` is constrained to "reasonable" numbers of satoshi, which cannot exceed 21 million bitcoins.now, in order to validate a transaction with input `a` and outputs `b` and `c`, you only have to prove `a = b + c`.  suppose we are hiding those amounts using pedersen commitments.  you have an input of amount `a`, and you know a` and `r`.  the blockchain has an amount `(a &lt;*&gt; h) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; g)`.  in order to create the two outputs `b` and `c`, you just have to create two new `r` scalars such that `r = r[0] + r[1]`.  then you create a transaction consuming the input `(a &lt;*&gt; h) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; g)` and outputs `(b &lt;*&gt; h) &lt;+&gt; (r[0] &lt;*&gt; g)` and  `(c &lt;*&gt; h) &lt;+&gt; (r[1] &lt;*&gt; g)`.  you know that `a = b + c`, and `r = r[0] + r[1]`, while fullnodes around the world, who don't know any of the amounts or scalars involved, can just take the points `(a &lt;*&gt; h) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; g)` and see if it equals `(b &lt;*&gt; h) &lt;+&gt; (r[0] &lt;*&gt; g) &lt;+&gt; (c &lt;*&gt; h) &lt;+&gt; (r[1] &lt;*&gt; g)`.  that is all that fullnodes have to validate, they just need to perform `&lt;+&gt;` operations on points and comparison on points, and from there they validate transactions, all without knowing the actual values involved.computational binding, information-theoretic hiding---------------------------------------------------like all commitments, pedersen commitments are binding and hiding.however, there are really two kinds of commitments:* computationally binding, information-theoretic hiding* information-theoretic binding, computationally hidingwhat does this mean?  it's just a measure of how "impossible" binding vs hiding is.  pedersen commitments are computationally binding, meaning that in theory, a user of this commitment with arbitrary time and space and energy can, in theory, replace the amount with something else.  however, it is information-theoretic hiding, meaning an attacker with arbitrary time and space and energy cannot figure out exactly *what* got hidden behind the commitment.but why?now, we have been using `a` and `a &lt;*&gt; g` as private keys and public keys in ecdsa and schnorr.  there is an operation `&lt;*&gt;` on a scalar and a point that generates another point, but we cannot "revrese" this operation.  for example, even if i know `a`, and know that `a = a &lt;*&gt; g`, but do not know `a`, i cannot derive `a` --- there is no `&lt;/&gt;` operation between `a &lt;/&gt; g` that lets me know `a`.actually there is: i "just" need to have so much time, space, and energy that i just start counting `a` from 0 to 2^256 and find *which* `a` results in `a = a &lt;*&gt; g`.  this is a computational limit: i don't have a spare universe in my back pocket i can use to do all those computations.now, replace `a` with `h` and `a` with `h`.  remember that pedersen commitments use a "second" standard generator point.  the generator points `g` and `h` are "not really special" --- they are just random points on the curve that we selected and standardized.  there is no operation `h &lt;/&gt; g` such that i can learn `h` where `h = h &lt;*&gt; g`, though if i happen to have a spare universe in my back pocket i can "just" brute force it.suppose i *do* have a spare universe in my back pocket, and learn `h = h &lt;/&gt; g` such that `h = h &lt;*&gt; g`.  what can i do in pedersen commitments?well, i have an amount `a` that is committed to by `(a &lt;*&gt; h) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; g)`.  but i happen to know `h`!  suppose i want to double my money `a` without involving elon musk.  then:* `(a &lt;*&gt; h) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; g)`* == `(a &lt;*&gt; (h &lt;*&gt; g)) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; g)`* == `((a * h) &lt;*&gt; g) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; g)`; remember, `&lt;*&gt;` is *also* homomorphic on multiplication `*`.* == `((a * h + a * h - a * h) &lt;*&gt; g) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; g)`; just add 0.* == `((a * h + a * h) &lt;*&gt; g) &lt;+&gt; ((-a * h) &lt;*&gt; g) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; g)`* == `((2 * a * h) &lt;*&gt; g) &lt;+&gt; ((r - a * h) &lt;*&gt; g)`* == `((2 * a) &lt;*&gt; (h &lt;*&gt; g)) &lt;+&gt; ((r - a * h) &lt;*&gt; g)`* == `((2 * a) &lt;*&gt; h) &lt;+&gt; ((r - a * h) &lt;*&gt; g)`; tada!! i doubled my money!**that** is what we mean by computationally binding: if i can compute `h` such that `h = h &lt;*&gt; g`, then i can find another number which opens the same commitment.  and of course i'd make sure that number is much larger than what i originally had in that address!now, the *reason* why it is "only" computationally binding is that it is information-theoretically hiding.  suppose somebody knows `h`, but has no money in the cryptocurrency.  all they see are points.  they can try to find what the original amounts are, but because any amount can be mapped to "the same" point with knowledge of `h` (e.g. in the above, `a` and `2 * a` got mapped to the same point by "just" replacing the salt `r` with `r - a * h`; this can be done for `3 * a`, `4 * a` etc.), they cannot learn historical amounts --- the `a` in historical amounts could be *anything*.the drawback, though, is that --- as seen above --- arbitrary inflation is now introduced once somebody knows `h`.  they can multiply their money by any arbitrary factor with knowledge of `h`.it is impossible to have *both* perfect hiding (i.e. historical amounts remain hidden even after a computational break) *and* perfect binding (i.e. you can't later open the commitment to a different, much larger, amount).pedersen commitments just happen to have perfect hiding, but only computationally-infeasible binding.  this means they allow hiding historical values, but in case of anything that allows better computational power --- including ***but not limited to*** quantum breaks --- they allow arbitrary inflation.changing the tradeoffs with elgamal commitments-----------------------------------------------an elgamal commitment is just a pedersen commitment, but with the point `r &lt;*&gt; g` also stored in a separate section of the transaction.this commits the `r`, and fixes it to a specific value.  this prevents me from opening my `(a &lt;*&gt; h) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; g)` as `((2 * a) &lt;*&gt; h) &lt;+&gt; ((r - a * h) &lt;*&gt; g)`, because the `(r - a * h)` would not match the `r &lt;*&gt; g` sitting in a separate section of the transaction.  this forces me to be bound to that specific value, and no amount of computation power will let me escape --- it is information-theoretically binding i.e. perfectly binding.but that is now computationally hiding.  an evil surveillor with arbitrary time and space can focus on the `r &lt;*&gt; g` sitting in a separate section of the transaction, and grind `r` from 0 to 2^256 to determine what `r` matches that point.  then from there, they can negate `r` to get `(-r) &lt;*&gt; g` and add it to the `(a &lt;*&gt; h) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; g)` to get `a &lt;*&gt; h`, and *then* grind that to determine the value `a`.  with massive increases in computational ability --- including ***but not limited to*** quantum breaks --- an evil surveillor can see all the historical amounts of confidential transactions. hi everyone! im a staff member of cryptonews.net app service, and our wallet account at blockchain.com was fuckin phished yesterday due to (1st - our stupidity, yeah) their flawed security system and google adwords combined. it really sucks and we are totally wasted since we had our dev budget over there :(((we are a small dev and editorial team, running our project for 3 years. we grow step by step, since we dont have investments. the point is, we kept our finance in a blockchain.com wallet since we considered these asshls to be reliable. also, fkin retarded google ad system still allows phishers of all kinds to profit from tons of

[https://cryptonews.net/en/news/security/385689/](https://cryptonews.net/en/news/security/385689/) hi guys. i have an extra couple raspberry pi's laying around that need a project. i also have a 42 in lcd hooked up. should i run the lighting network? i don't know anything about it. does anyone have any suggestions on a rotating display that shows the markets. maybe zooms in on a few coins. shows the charts/news/etc. thanks! looking back bitcoin has had a hell of a ride.one aspect kept comming back though; underestimating the next step up.just look back at conversations in different time frames, every hurdle was going to be impossible to take, to just being rolled over...it was never going to reach $1, for sure $100 was dreaming, reaching parity with an ounce of gold well keep dreaming, ever going to touch $10k you are just insane, companies going to use it as their reserve pffff get out.....and next ath will be the same..no matter what it will be the incoming money will again surprise most. if it will be pension funds, governments, hedge funds, or whatever i don't care..the only real risk i see is a possible panick.number of newly mined coins is low compared to what it was, while mentioned parties above have way more fiat to spill than previous cycles mainly initiated by just small parties.if the next run gets just a bit out of hand things go nuts.if pension funds, or governments openly step in, demand would outstrip supply by a magnitude.which hodler is going to sell if price goes nuts and no end in sight since every one can do the basic math how much fiat will roughly chase that limited number of coins?just that attitude will make the price go even more nuts..look at the dire state of most fiat.look at the unsustainable debts.the system will start to crumble and not just the weak usual suspects,  no this time big players like the euro and dollar will get hurt.i don't know how we should prepare for such an bull run.all i can say is 'don't get blown away, don't sell easy'.hodl, strong..  . just reading the third global cryptoasset benchmarking study by the cambridge centre for alternative finance and released how fast is the user number

feature projects i personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. i feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. at this point, i plan to try to continue making these posts until i have completed a full year.-if you decide to reply, please add something more than, "scam" or "this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020". please say why. if it is a scam, link or show evidence. if you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? it seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags.-i strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. there is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. you may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. i

[removed] [removed] what are you folks watching on youtube?im looking for some suggestions/new channels to watch to get more crypto news or viewpoints. honestly i dont even want to define what i want because there may be content out there i havent even thought of!so let me hear your opinions on what to watch. i guess i shouldnt limit it to just youtube so if theres a good show on other sites (or a podcast)... sure, why not!

[removed] [removed] [removed] so im new to trading, trying to learn and have seen this specific trend of orders pop up on exchanges, its probably very common but its easy to spot the larger orders than the hundreds of smaller.let me try to explain what i see and maybe someone can fill me in:when watching the order books for both buy/sell i see people put up both a buy and a sell order (same amounts) and they are placed barely above and below the average market price at that point.the difference between the buy &amp; sell orders are (for this example) around 1.8%.but the thing is that when the market price moves down or up the trader keeps updating those orders accordingly to the mid market price so they don't get executed, and the seem to always hover around 1.8% difference.im guessing its done via a trading bot, is there a name for this specific strategy? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] in light of the recent kucoin incident, do we know about the safety of the trading account vs the main account? if funds are in the main account, are they safe(r) since they cant be traded? i know its safest altogether to not have the money on an exchange at all, but i do like to have a non-life-altering sum of money sitting there to mess around with. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] does anyone have a workaround for trading moons on xmoon.exchange?my main two questions are: is rinkeby testnet eth compatible with my metamask? also, if the faucet is not working with my social media post how do i get rinkeby eth? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] did i just fuck myself?thetatoken.org only shows theta and tfuel in the wallet (both are 0) but there are no other coins up.i thought they accepted eth?!transaction was successful but still says pending.anyone have any ideas er suggestions? im freakin out [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] ive been in the process of pulling my crypto thats remaining on the exchanges off and for the past 3-4 days, ive been unable to withdraw xlm from binance.us.anyone know if its been just the past few days or is this something that has been going on for awhile? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] 99% of people that tend to lose money on exchange hacks or similar situations that can lead to your account being tied up for an extended period of time.majority of crypto is still used to monetary gain and people believing they're going to be the next michael burry and make it while day trading and or picking the right "gem".  but its because of these traders that mostly throw away their life savings that crypto in general has the volume in order to keep volatility low as it is or even cause the price to move a decent amount depending on the situation.saying "not your keys not your coins" doesnt actually mean anything to these people because they dont care if they deposited fiat to the exchange or cryptocurrency. the goal in the first place was to keep the coins on the exchange in order to take advantage of price movement to either sell those coins or buy up another token in when market movements happen.

[removed] i just staked 7 tron in the atomic wallet. and they say yearly yield is 5%. does that mean i can't see every day how much i earned? ;( in a long conversation about investing, me and my dad agree that cryptocurrency will play a significant role in the futures financial system. my dad acknowledges the power of the tech and has some fascination with smart contract platforms like eth.but..he argues against buying btc specifically. his theory is that btc is fundamentally similar to gold from an economics stand point, yes, but there is nothing specifically special about btc in the crypto ecosystem other than the fact that its got the first mover advantage. apparently, btc is popular only because..its popular!gold is special in its use cases, as it plays a significant role in jewellery, manufacturing and areas that make it physically superior to other metals - but nothing actually makes btc superior to other cryptocurrencies other than the large number of people that trust the network today. his view is that if btc was replicated but with slightly better tech (for example, further decentralisation by making entry to mining easier/cheaper), the original btc will lose in the long run. his view is that btc is superior today but not tomorrow.help.

[removed] i've been analyzing the graph of prices of currencies like bitcoin, ethereum and nano and i noticed a certain thing in common: the price of these cryptocurrencies is too volatile.  in certain periods, a unit of these currencies may rise at exorbitant prices and then fall dramatically.  these moments can make it difficult to adopt these coins in daily use for one reason: imagine if the money you used to buy 1 kg of food could buy 2 kg of food tomorrow.  you would be reluctant to buy anything.  the same would happen with companies.  how can you calculate costs and profit issues if there is no long-term value stability?if you happen to disagree with my opinion and believe that it needs adjustments, show me the way and point out my mistakes.  i love being corrected in such cases. [removed] [removed] [removed] after coming back to this community recently i have seen a lot of talk about the differing volatility in price movements between global stock markets and the crypto markets. i just wanted to remind everyone that a 3% drop in the stock market is approximately $903,000,000,000 which is almost triple the value of all cryptos in existence! so when looking at price movements it is important to keep in mind the size of the markets and the dollar value in movements. good luck to all and happy trading!

[removed] when markets get exciting, it's time to batten down the hatches. new people are entering the space and will soon be exposed to scams and phishing sites.##a new crypto user and their crypto are easily parted.here are a few ways to prevent that:###1. get a hardware wallet.a hardware wallet holds your private key within the device and protects it from being exposed. it's recommended to use a hardware wallet for cold storage (the funds you don't plan to touch).the two biggest players are ledger and trezor. both are great.###2. browse safely.always use bookmarks and never click links, and install an extension like [metamask](https://metamask.io/) or [eal](https://harrydenley.com/ethaddresslookup-chrome-extension-release/) to protect you from known phishing sites.###3. never enter your private keys on a website.one of the most common ways for someone to be parted from their cryptocurrency is via a phishing site, a.k.a. a fake version of a real site. phishing sites will usually allow you to enter your private key so you can "access" your funds, but as soon as you enter your private key they'll send it to their servers, access your funds themselves, and drain your account.[it's a bad habit to enter your private key into a website](https://medium.com/mycrypto/private-keys-websites-aa85b42113a0). just don't do it. if you have to use a private key / mnemonic phrase / keystore file, use a [desktop application](https://download.mycrypto.com/) that's away from the browser. even then, make sure to [verify](https://support.mycrypto.com/staying-safe/verifying-authenticity-of-desktop-app) it's not a fake desktop application.###4. turn on 2fa for everything. everything.choose google authenticator over authy. don't use your phone number. then, make sure your phone number is not tied to your google account (look in privacy settings).[sim-swapping is real and common](https://medium.com/mycrypto/what-to-do-when-sim-swapping-happens-to-you-1367f296ef4d) and if your phone number is attached to any account recoveries, you could be in real trouble.###5. be mindful of where you store your keys.don't store your keys on cloud storage like dropbox. don't store your keys in your email. ideally, don't store your keys on any device that's connected to the internet. all of these things can be accessed by bad actors if you're not careful.use a hardware wallet, and keep your backups safe on an [air-gapped device](https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/air-gapped-computer/) or in a safe physical location.###6. verify everything.check the urls of the websites you're on.check the urls of the social media accounts you're reading.check the urls of the github repos you're exploring.never download anything from an unverified url that someone sent you - go find the proper url at the proper source.double- and triple-check everything, especially when you're sending a transaction - read and verify the output addresses. for an extra layer of assurance when sending a transaction, try out [protected transactions](https://support.mycrypto.com/general-knowledge/about-mycrypto/what-are-protected-transactions).###7. never click on ads/promoted results.many times these promoted results are actually promoting scam/fake/phishing sites.###8. nobody is giving away eth.ever.ever.if you see someone giving away crypto or saying that you have to send them crypto to get more crypto in return, run away. it's not real.###9. look out for one another.if you've been in this space for a while, you know exponentially more than someone who started exploring it. things move quickly, so it's likely that you're an expert in some of these subjects, and you can share this knowledge to help new users build better habits.you have the power to help others not screw up. use that power!###10. use your brain.always stop and think.don't assume, ask.don't blindly follow, question.patience is truly a virtue.if something seems too good to be true, it's likely not true. [removed] do you think they will be listed on binance in the future? do you think they can replace doge as the ultimate meme coin? personally i see big potential in these moons and i think they will overtake doge coin in the coming year.on the other hand i wonder what is the utility of these tokens and what would cause it to go up in price? but then again that's true for most cryptos and we seen them mooning all the time.i also wonder what will happen when other communities start getting their own tokens and what if people start vote manipulation.what are your thoughts? hello, i just watched a 30 minute hype video from weiss ratings, crypto currency and crypto stock and looks quite interesting as far as early market tips. but for a special deal @ $29 /12 issues, etc but is it really any good and worth it? thanks, data_geek [removed] [removed] [removed] what are some you do like? altcoins seem like its a fun pump and dump, day-trading like activity, but what are some that you like? im really digging chainlink and omg, but i wish i understood the technology more. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] im attempting to create a chart of the top 50 coins from coinmarketcap and comparing all of their highest current tps (nothing thats claimed, only tps thats currently achievable on the mainnet).once completed i will share to r/cryptocurrency. i was however wondering if theres any other metrics people might be interested in being included? [removed] [removed] selling my moons i got for upvotes on an internet forum that i mainly use whilst taking a dump for over $1000.messed up thing is, this will probably age like milk and they'll be worth insane amounts more in 5 years.still, getting paid for going to the toilet seems pretty nice after 2020.cheers everyone. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i'm trying to withdraw some chainlink to my ledger nano s using ledger live for the first time. at the very last step where it ask to confirm withdrawal, it asks to enter a 2fa code but when i log into andotp there's no other prompt other than the alternating 6 digits used to sign into kraken. (i tried several of the 6 digits and it didn't work)please help as you probably know, 90-95% of day-traders are unprofitable so i'm actually super proud of my achievement. i had almost given up so many times and it turns out the bear market was a blessing in disguise as it essentially turned me into a beast of a trader. i now understand things so much better than ever before and of course i'm still learning, but one thing i will tell you is that 90% of the trading-educational materials out there are written by the same 90% who are unprofitable and are most likely selling courses to fuel their degenerate gambling addiction, so you can imagine, i have an extremely cynical view on trading info out there, you need to be extremely skeptical of everyone, including me. anyway, i would like to share at least whatever i have learned to help those who are serious. i know statistically most will not have the discipline to make it out there but it's the least i can do. so if you got any questions, ask away!some proof of my profitability: i joined 2 trading competitions this year.* on [interdax](https://i.imgur.com/ucijivl.png), i placed 23rd with 67% pnl. it was a 3 week long comp and i was only active for 1 week of it as i was on a road trip and still managed to beat the pack.* on my first competition, it was on [bybit](https://i.imgur.com/xq6um0r.png), i placed 9th place in the team with a measly 16% pnl but enough to be in the money. i have 9 1000% gains this year. interested to hear what project you think can 10x fastest that you hold? my current bet is on rarible. an nft platform that is expanding rapidly during the perfect shift from many people's attention on defi to digital collectibles. even famous artists are flocking to the platform to sell their work such as recording artist, rac. it's currently around a 10 million market cap.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] so i was going through some old thumbdrives and stumbled upon a mysterious file, **private.zip**inside was a word document titled **blockchain wallet** along with an .exe entitled **passworddecoder**the blockchain wallet word file contained a 172 character string, uppercase/lowercase letters and numbers, no symbols.knowing i wouldn't have anything malicious on my old thumbdrives i opened the .exe. a command style window opens... **enter password :**tried the blockchain wallet file string, every old password i could remember for the last ten years, keep getting am error for wrong password.what the heck did i stumble across and does anyone know what i can do with it? thanks! [removed] [removed] [removed] as the hacker continues to dump through uniswap we witness real time money laundering. the main source of tokens in the hack has the ability to pause transactions meaning its not actually decentralized. is defi is failing? do you think uniswap will get shutdown by sec? what other effects will happen because of this situation? [removed] when trying to get a person into crypto, you cant take a fiat bad, crypto good stance, it wont work. people are tribal, and will jump to defend what theyre currently affiliated with if you give them any reason to act defensive.start off by asking if they have any problems with their current issues. some key points that have worked well for me are:1. the fact you have to give away all the information someone needs to get money from your bank account any time to have to pay with a card.2. the long wait times for bank transactions.3. the steady inflation of our current system, making your money depreciate.3. the banks typically restrict your ability to take money out during a financial crisis4. centralized control.after you relate to them, present it as just something you think is really cool, not in a this-is-the-only-way maximalist method. at this point a lot of people will refer back to the crypto bubble at the start of 2018, calling it a scam. do not get defensive, simply explain people were using it as a stock rather than a currency so that it lacked stability as well as being a massive bandwagon. tell how it was healthy to get all the blind investors, who buy when they see green and dump when they see red, out of the way so that it could prosper under people who believe in the projects, not just the money.if they show interest, tell them youd be more then happy to help them get started and that they should talk to you about which coins are worth buying before making any decisions (you might have to explain theres more than bitcoin at this point, do not over explain, just say theres different coins with different goals creating a competitive market trying to offer users the best available currency). leave it at that.if you have any points youd like to add to the list, let me know and ill edit it in. sorry if the flair doesnt really fit, there wasnt an option i could see fitting better, but i wanted to get this out there so that people stop looking at us all like were crazy. good luck everybody! [removed] tl:dr defi saver dapp was compromised by a front running smart contract, if you have used it, login with your metamask to remove permissions.long story, a few months ago i made use of the comp defi craze farming 0x.upon redeeming my 0x, it vanished.i assumed my metamask was compromised, creates a new account and never used my old one again.today i accidentally withdrew my dai to my old metamask, because i am a moron. on etherscan it showed my internal erc-20 transactions - with my dai immediately being sent to 'defi-saver safeguard'naturally, i loaded defi saver and was met immediately with a screen advising me that there had been a successful front running attack on their smart contracts and as a precaution had set up an automatic safe guarding fund that siphons the vulnerable tokens into their safe vault.in order to redeem your funds from them, you must remove the illegitimate permissions by certain addresses and then defi saver sent me back my dai.the 0x is still a mystery - i am in contact with them now hoping for a solution, it's possible it was unrelated.therefore:if you have used defi saver with metamask in the last 4 months your wallet is at risk.any questions fire away. i would add that defi saver have bern nothing but honest and professional regarding the entire situation.

(disclaimer: my crypto portfolio i hold 99% btc; so i'm not a ltc shill -- just wanting to learn more)hi cc,i'm trying to make up a balanced opinion on it with the following arguments:1. it's the second oldest cryptocurrency which is (almost) a direct carbon source code copy of btc so has all the properties of hard money like btc2. it has been around for a long time so is possibly experiencing lindy effects ([https://www.wealest.com/articles/lindy-effect](https://www.wealest.com/articles/lindy-effect))3. potential as a true second layer payments mechanism i.e. how silver (ltc) was to gold (btc)4. litebringer (a game with ltc payments) just launched and has skyrocketed ltc payment numbers ([https://decrypt.co/42562/litecoin-transactions-skyrocket-as-litebringer-game-takes-off](https://decrypt.co/42562/litecoin-transactions-skyrocket-as-litebringer-game-takes-off))i hear almost nothing of ltc in the news yet it has the 4th most coin by volume (huge!) but only the 12th largest by market cap (not so huge).i'd be interested to hear balanced arguments and the outlook of ltc.cheers.

[https://youtu.be/zw1aid735ym](https://youtu.be/zw1aid735ym)armory is unusable at this point. [removed] as we know, the rise of cryptomonies is just beginning. bitcoin brought about a boom in the world from which there's no turning back, and they've started to be used as a form of payment in different sectors, which helps the movement of them and helps more and more people to use them. even from the point of view of entertainment platforms, there are many casinos and gambling places that accept and move bitcoins and more crypts, among them:earnbet (first decentralized online casino)sportbets.io (if you're looking for sports betting)bitstarsz (btc bonuses)what other entertainment venues use bitcoins? if this has been asked before, would appreciate if someone can point me to it.....i understand that miners are getting paid for solving the block hash and participate in pools to increase their chances but also split the reward. my question is regarding settlement of transactions by normal btc users running full nodes. i know when i am sending btc to someone or transferring from on chain to a off chain wallet, there is a fee i have to pay to settle that transaction. is that fee paid to normal full node operators and if so, is that not a passive income strategy? to just run a btc full node and participate in settling onchain transactions and collect whatever $1,$2,$3,$5, etc..... i'm a beginner learning about bitcoin so don't judge me too harshly.let's assume for the sake of this argument, every bitcoin has already been mined, so all 21m are there on the market.let's say i had 1,000 btc stored on a hardware wallet and i lose it completely.does it mean mining will resume to fill those 1000 void? how does the bitcoin system analyze this? switching for non-custodial btc otc swaps like whalesheaven's, and any other suggestions? since grayscale bought 17,100 bitcoins last week and only 900 is being produced daily, it made me wonder why miners sell.the way i see it, the only reason miners or people in general sell btc for fiat/alts1. need of their native fiat currency to pay for electricity, food, security2. altcoins to try to make more gains in fiat or try to pump and dump back into btc (unless they truly believe in that altcoin)3. knowing the demand of another currency going rise (end of feb. when covid was announced everyone wanted the usd, an announcement of digital currency and banning btc)once people start realizing the fixed supply of btc is a good thing and that it is the most secure network, people would rather be paid in btc. that is if we are continuing towards a digital world.now imagine if btc was already mainstream and everyone defines it as hard money1.  a portion of your btc is used as currency to trade for goods and services like a debit card with lighting integration and the other portion is kept in the main vault2. altcoins will be used for specific purposes (think of chuck e. cheese tokens, or privacy coins like monero to access ultra porn) or pump and dump like always3. physical fiat or other types of currency will be used if the country or city is underdeveloped/amish city/ anti 5g landwhen i was first introduced to bitcoin in 2015 the person talking sounded like a salesman and thought it was a pyramid scheme or scam. then i bought in during the hype and sold at a loss because oh this thing was going to die. but it didn't die and went back up to 6k. it made me wonder why would people still want it if it was a scam. and that's when i discovered the truth about money. i forgot what i did since i saved the key and wallet address on my pc and never touched that after. i need some emergency money and want to withdraw but i forgot how/what i did to store that money out of an exchange and in my private wallet. how can i withdraw the money into my back account? [removed] first of all i don't know if i can refer to coinbase, etoro, luno etc.. as brokers. can we say that those apps that allow you to buy/sell bitcoin are called online brokers? i noticed that each of them sell/buy bitcoin at a different price? is that correct? why is that? sorry for my english.. was wondering if anyone has used or used dcbcoin i have like 1300$ on it and i can't get it out without depositing. probably a scam can anyone provide a banker referral for signature bank? pms are open, would be much appreciated!

(we cannot know or police the content of the block chains, but that's what will likely happen.)so, i'm asking for help identifying those laws being proposed by trump and his doj to make sure they do not destroy or weaken 230 protections that will kill alt tech like crypto.  if you can identify the bill numbers and the texts of these bills, please respond so we can dissect what they're up to.

found (sorry if they are out of context):who has access to the central bank balance sheet, and how, is a debate that has been going on for hundreds of years. in the early years of central banking, this discussion was mostly about the optimal provision of money as a means of payment. the banks of amsterdam and hamburg, for example, which are now considered as having performed key central bank functions as early as the beginning of the 17th century, were created to provide giro deposits as an efficient and stable method for merchants to pay each other, greatly facilitating trade....more generally, central bank liabilities provided a convenient means of payment to allow clearing and establish trust in the financial system. but debate raged in the 18th and 19th centuries over the relative merits of different central bank liabilities. the universal nature of banknotes, and the possibility to use them in a decentralised way, eventually made them the more important central bank liability.but over time, technological advances, financial intermediation based on a stable bank-borrower relationship and the obvious inconveniences of currency  it can get lost, be destroyed or stolen  all led to banknotes gradually being superseded by bank deposits. yet, repeated banking crises highlighted that commercial bank deposits were themselves vulnerable to runs, since banks assets are typically illiquid while their liabilities can be withdrawn at will....in many ways, this debate over the relative merits of banknotes and accounts, and over central banks and banks as main issuers of money, has once more returned.with the recent fad about crypto assets, pioneered by bitcoin, the idea has been floated for central banks to issue their own digital currencies  lets call them universal reserves  that would allow all individuals to hold central bank liabilities in the form of both banknotes and coins as well as electronic central bank reserves.what distinguishes the discussion today from previous discussions, however, are three new facts:* the first is that we are seeing a dramatic decline in the demand for cash in some countries, in particular sweden and norway.* the second is that central banks today could make use of new technologies that would enable the introduction of what is widely referred to as a token-based currency  one based on a distributed ledger technology (dlt) or comparable cryptographic technology.* and the third new fact, at least from a long-term perspective, relates to the role of central banks in setting monetary policy, and more recently to the emergence of negative rates as a policy instrument and the consequences for the transmission of monetary policy.i would argue that, in most countries, the first fact  the disappearance of cash  is not a cause for imminent action. you can see this on my first slide. demand for banknotes is still growing around the world, and in the euro area cash remains a popular means of payment....digital tokens  call them fedcoin, ecbcoin or why not biscoin  are different in two main ways. first, they would save the central bank the operational risks and costs related to administering individual central bank accounts for millions of households and companies. **second, they may share one of the key features of cash, namely that the identity of the holders would  at least in principle  not be known to the central bank.**...in 2010, two bitcoin enthusiasts agreed to exchange two large pizzas for the price of 10,000 bitcoins. in a forum one of them wrote: i'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas like maybe two large ones so i have some left over for the next day. at that time, 10,000 bitcoins were worth about 32. today, 10,000 bitcoins are worth more than 70 million. last year, this would have been enough to buy van goghs 1889 painting laboureur dans un champ. **so, as it stands today, bitcoin is bad money and a poor payment system.**...although the eurosystem has been charging an annual **interest rate of -0.4%** on banks excess reserves for more than two years now, almost **no euro area banks have passed these negative rates on to their household clients.** in some jurisdictions this is due to legal impediments, but in most cases it simply reflects banks long-run perspective  that is their efforts to maintain a sustainable source of profit and, hence, a stable deposit base....interest-bearing universal reserves would directly compete with bank deposits. in a systemic crisis, despite the protection provided by government deposit guarantee schemes, households and businesses could seek to hold their wealth in the riskless central bank liability rather than the riskier private sector one. while this shift could also happen now between deposits and cash, **a digital currency would make it cheaper and faster, making digital bank runs more frequent and more severe.**...**this means that universal central bank reserves may accelerate the euro areas journey towards a less bank-based economy.**...boring stuff...let me conclude.technological advances, changes in the structure of the financial system and recent monetary policy developments all mean that, in the future, central banks will need to consider whether the current arrangements for accessing their balance sheets are optimal.it doesnt only matter *how* central bank money is created, but also *to whom* it is issued.**from todays perspective, there are no clear benefits from allowing the general public to hold digital central bank reserves, in particular in economies where demand for cash remains robust, such as in the euro area.** this assessment includes considerations related to the potential impact of central bank digital currencies on financial structures in general, and the stability of bank deposits in particular.in the medium term, a more incremental reform could consist of giving a broader range of financial market participants access to the liability side of the central banks balance sheet, provided that this can help strengthen the transmission of monetary policy in an environment of excess liquidity.thank you. just a post to show everyone appreciation on this subreddit.  i can't believe there is a way to exchange moons out for other tokens.  what a time to be alive.  i think moons is a great idea to get new people into crypto with little to no risk.  so cheers everyone and hopefully some of our other bags will moon in the process! [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] this subreddit is becoming home to a bunch of memes, how to convert moon posts, shit posts and less relevant information regarding cryptocurrency. i honestly dont give a fuck about moons, have 0 and dont intend on accumulating any, but this is getting a bit out of hand for people like me that actually want quality updates and information. hey guys. i have been trading cryptos for a while, and i never thought about yield farming as being a thing. that was... until a few days ago. i was looking at a few token charts, and i found one i thought promising, and so i bought it. turns out, it was a yield farming token. i did some research, and found i could get more of this token simply by staking it.but... what value does it have? why is the price increasing if they are literally giving away more of this token? and that is when i started to do my research. there was finally an aha moment, when i found that the group that released this token was doing market buy orders of their own token to prop up the price with money they earned from assets under management that allowed them to make money in a competitive manner.then i dug even deeper. needless to say, i was impressed. this token was performing the same type of operation as a classic financial services investment corporation. so, what was this operation called? [harvest.finance](https://harvest.finance). since then, i have completely changed my view on farming tokens, and i have had a seismic shift in the way i look at value. if you are aren't making money while you are asleep... your tokens are valueless aside from their retail value.under this new paradigm, both bitcoin and ether are valueless. but lp tokens from uniswap that have both btc and ether in them have value. what is even more valuable are those tokens being staked in uniswap. i shifted up my entire strategy, and i can say that for the first time since getting into crypto, i am relaxed. no more moonboi jitters. just slow steady and more importantly... reliable profits. and yes, those profits do go up and down, but i have crunched the numbers and i am going to be able to give myself a $50 a day raise every month for as long as the bull market continues by reinvesting.and when the bull market drops dead in six months? well... my revenue will drop by 75% to 50% but it won't matter, because by then, i will be making enough passive income to quit my job. :dso, what other platforms do you guys use for yield farming? i am looking for steady reliable income. things like tossing usdc-usdt in a liquidity pool and then staking that is the gold standard in safety from a crypto bear market, but i haven't found platforms offering that. staking renbtc-wbtc is the gold standard of safety against a crypto bull market. now, i am not saying profitable. profit is inherently risky. safe is what matters. i would like to know more about the cutting edge of crypto, the major players and projects. who or what is the best source of information for you?im not looking for mooning coins or hype, just the normal information brokers that you find credible enough to pay attention to.i listen to techmeme ride home, i think thats great for tech news. if anyone knows something like that for the crypto space i would be very thankful. doge is 350 million plus market cap and currently sitting in top 50 coins in crypto. appreciate its large community backing but other than that, very little use case. billions in max supply.moon's max supply is 250 million and current market cap is circa 3 million. is it not a 100x candidate in a few year's time? reddit will need to keep supporting and expanding it but a large community of redditors is already there.why can't all different types of coins / rewards etc. on reddit be all merged into one - moon?

[removed] apparently i'm eligible for claiming moons, but when i click on my vault the following message pops up&gt;open vault&gt;&gt;your account already has a vault associated with it, but we can't find it on this device. recover it by using the recovery phrase you created during vault back up, or from an existing ethereum wallet like metamask.i don't remember creating this vault, but i've been using the same metamask account for a long time. should i just try to type in that metamask's seed phrase or would that overwrite my vault and possible whipe out my moons?

[removed] -today's crypto of the day is avalanche (avax), and it's current price is $4.55.-since 2/18/20, every day i have featured a new crypto of the day for us to discuss. i try to make follow up posts within a week, but i am behind at the moment. i try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. sometimes i even feature projects i personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. i feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. at this point, i plan to try to continue making these posts until i have completed a full year.-if you decide to reply, please add something more than, "scam" or "this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020". please say why. if it is a scam, link or show evidence. if you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? it seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags.-i strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. there is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. you may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. i know i certainly did!https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/search?q=author%3ajoenorwood77&amp;restrict_sr=on-these posts are not meant to be financial advice, but instead to be an educational discussion. everyone is responsible for doing their own research.

UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// i got a discord message saying i was randomly selected across servers and won 0.4158 btc. it led to a website called zefbit.com and i couldnt find anything on social media about them. just wondering if anyone has heard of this website? okay, so im 17 in canada and  i turn 18  in 3months but really want to buy a crypto currency before 2020 because i know the price will rise. what my plan was is to find a site where you don't need id verification phone number verification and buy directly with visa or paypal and i store them on a phone wallet until i can move them to a ledger wallet but this proved to be a pain in the ass so please pleaseee if you know any sites where i can buy cryptocurrency with a visa card or paypal instantly let me knowi already tried the following which didnt work for me\-bull bitcoin\-paxful\-coin berry\-cex.iothanks for reading considering if 1 btc = $10,000then $1 = 0.000089 btc = 8900 satoshinow, if 1btc = $100,000 (expectation)then $1 = 0.0000088 btc = 890 satoshi&amp;#x200b;now, this means transferring $1 will cost in terms of fee will be 100 satoshi ( let ) which is equal to 1070 satoshi today, then transferring payments will have huge fees. [removed] [removed] with the rise in blockchain technology, we see many new use cases taking place on blockchain technology, etc. proof-of-stake, defi, nfts, digital assets, dapps, etc and wonder if theres a possibility for all these new use cases to take place ontop of bitcoin protocol?ultimately, bitcoin protocol is the most secured and most high profile pow network in the industry, thus if its possible to build extensions to bitcoin protocol, and allow hodlers and bitcoiners to:1. stake and earn btc (which further democratize the space, where you no longer need specialized equipment and lots of $ to mine btc)2. have smart contract capabilities ontop of bitcoin protocol e.g. clarity. (which allows for development of more comprehensive dapps to be based on bitcoin protocol)3. nfts / digitization of real world assets ontop of bitcoin protocolpersonally deep dived on the above topic and shared my thoughts here: [https://ethan-tan.com/a-beginners-guide-to-proof-of-transfer/](https://ethan-tan.com/a-beginners-guide-to-proof-of-transfer/) sorry if thats a dumb question im assuming the price will drop? im fairly new to bitcoin. looking to buy some bitcoin, we can set up trade on localcoinswap if needed for escrow system, 5% above market max so a friend of mine has been making money buying bitcoin then selling large amounts on localcryptos for up to 7% above market value instantly, is this truest achievable? it seems too easy. any opinions would be appreciated.thanks,kaden hello reddit,before you rip me apart, please understand i am just beginning to learn bitcoin. i admit that the entire concept has really grasped me.my question is one of legit curiosity. not trying to stir up trouble or say bitcoin is good or bad.but basically, if i have bit coin as currency.. whats to force me to pay taxes? the government would never know how much money i have more how much im spending. wouldnt this make it really easy to avoid taxes?i understand that if btc were an actual currency that was provided by w2 income then obviously it would be reported to the irs. so this question doesnt really apply to the potential future of bitcoin.what i am talking about the immediate future. say somebody makes $100k on a bitcoin investment. sure if they converted to fiat and suddenly made a $100k investment that would set off alarms, but what if they made small deposits as needed. just a few grand here or there.i am not promoting breaking the law. i am just curious how bitcoin people reconcile this. i have a very high w2 income and i pay my taxes. not gonna lie though, when nearly half my income goes to uncle sam it hurts! and i imagine that if there were a simple and u traceable way to avoid that im sure a lot of people would struggle with that temptation.any thoughts are appreciated!

[removed] got a feeling that after the first us 2020 debate tonight, bitcoin may sore. even so, i bought on the off chance that one of the presidential candidates mentions it during the debate. now, dont say i didnt worn you later this week. imagine this: a decentralized system of global, regional, and local governance administered by an eco-system of interrelated, intercommunicable blockchains.we could borrow the best aspects of all the political-economic theories, synthesize them, and codify them into an unbiased, unhackable, immutable protocol that would administer every type of policy that human beings rely on for survival within a global society (economic, budgetary, political, tax, social.. etc) through automation.every blockchain would provide a check and balance on the others to keep the system stable.unlike other political-economic systems (representative democracy, socialism, capitalism, communism.. etc), there would no vulnerabilities in the protocol that could be exploited, further ensuring the stability of the system and violence would be rendered obsolete.we could literally replace all systems of centralized power with a decentralized system that any citizen of the world could participate in and monitor from the palm of their hand, creating a perfect symbiosis between humanity and technology. we would no longer have to appeal to authority figures or institutions for the instructions on how to live our lives. in fact, we could liberate oursleves individually and, at the same time, encourage community by feeding, clothing, and housing the poor of the world.&amp;#x200b;thoughts? is there any person or organization out there that is working on this? any1 selling bitcoin? ill paypal u. when i copy the address that uses the lightning network into bitpay, it can't use it. hodl elite: the staker class no-coiners love to talk about bitcoin tail risks as a reason not to invest:* "governments might try to shut it down"* "what if a new coin is the facebook and bitcoin is the myspace"* etc. etc.it is both true that these are valid arguments for why bitcoin might fail and that bitcoin is an incredible investment.every single asset has tail risks. the government can ban gold ownership. tesla might be cooking their books. apple's hq might get destroyed by a comet. all possible but low probability events.the point that no-coiners are missing is that as long as the risk/reward trade-off is favorable, who gives a shit about tail risks. bitcoin has an extremely favorable risk-adjusted return profile.tldr: anyone who references tail risks as a reason not to invest in bitcoin does not truly understand investing.

[removed] tbtc is one of the most promising bridges from bitcoin to ethereum, now that they finally properly launched.in  their pr they mention you can collaterize the transfered btc with your  eth at 150% and earn. any ideas how much would that be?also they mention you can earn with just your btc as well, but they don't mention neither how or how much.for some reason the only community they have is on discord, and you can't even write there. all channels are closed for users. i understand they make you pay a fee when exchanging bitcoins for euro. however the exchanging ratio i'm looking at is already different depending on the service i'm using. i remember that luno and coinbase make you pay a fee before exchange bitcoins for euro but the exchange ratio i've seen before exchanging with these services were already different. why is that? i  know this is generally thought of to be stupid, but with the way things  are going i have zero faith in any government backed anything right  now, including real estate and the obvious things like stocks. the only  exception is commodities and metals. which would be the other 20% of my  port just as a hedge.it seems  like with the way things are going hyper inflation is on the horizon,  and i have been researching the global economic forum and everything is  heading toward the blockchain anyways.it  seems to me bitcoin is almost in that "too big to fail" place, because  it's used worldwide and even if every country unanimously comes together  and bans it i don't even know how this could or would be enforced.am i crazy for thinking this?additionally,  are there other complete doom scenarios that could take bitcoin down?  i'm primarily talking about bitcoin here since almost all coins are  directly tied to it, but my portfolio would consist of a variety of  coins.what are your thoughts? am i  missing anything? i realize i'll get some very biased answers but  hoping some people here have thought through the potential long term  downsides. i'm only investing money that won't change my lifestyle.thanks in advance.

[removed] [removed] i have used cmc a lot on and off since 2015. when i saw ethereum for the first time &lt;$1 and said, "what the hell is ethereum?" i was looking at its price on cmc.it used to be an excellent, lightweight, simplistic list of coins that were actually sorted by market cap. that's what made it popular in the first place. over time, however, it began to change. it got more bloated. slower. it seems to have gotten much worse more recently.additionally, more rules were imposed so that many coins with unusually high market caps began showing up on page 4 or 100+ rankings lower than they really belong in terms of market cap. volume from certain exchanges are excluded at random. they say they do this for ethical reasons, but they're also pretty eager to shill pnd defi food tokens and the selective bias there is just gross.one of my holdings is in a lesser-known (xsn) and i swear cmc breaks it's ranking in some new way every week. it doesn't even come up when you search for it anymore. at some point, it became "ineligible for regular ranking" because cmc considered it one cex "short" of a good spread. that brought it's ranking down considerably. then it got listed on a us-regulated exchange that prides itself on having zero wash trading. all good right? lolno. now cmc decided to exclude the volume on it's most popular exchange and its us-regulated one as "outliers". they deemed it's least popular exchange where gets almost no volume as legit, though.am i daft for insinuating that binance spent $400 million on cmc to slowly make it their "top 100 favorite coins" list (a 'coinsifeelrankhigherthanothersfornoparticularreasoncap', if you will) and censor smaller projects and competitors that didn't pay to play under the guise of "ethics"? forgive the plug here, but it's no coincidence that xsn has been building a layer 2 dex since 2018 and serves as a potential competitor to binance. it's also no coincidence that the xsn team built all throughout the bear market on no ico, taking no breaks, and yet they get near-zero industrial recognition for their breakthroughs. all the industrial titans instead hop on "buidling" ill-fated ico tokens that just got started in the past few weeks in direct response to defi hype money.but enough about that...as far as i see it, they can insist on filtering out erratics in a futile effort to save crypto investors from themselves (it doesn't) for "ethical reasons" or they can shill them erratic garbage that will be forgotten in a few weeks, but they can't do both. i think we can all agree on this, at least.all that said, i use coingecko a lot more now because it seems to be closer to what cmc was a few years ago but i still occasionally use cmc as charts can differ. let me know if you disagree, or if you know of any other decent projects that got stiffed for not bribing the gatekeepers.

[removed] there are already good resources out there such as:[https://medium.com/dappworks/full-guide-convert-reddits-moon-cryptocurrency-into-e349ec1992d0#:\~:text=click%20on%20arrow%20button%20in,click%20%e2%80%9csend%20moons%e2%80%9d](https://medium.com/dappworks/full-guide-convert-reddits-moon-cryptocurrency-into-e349ec1992d0#:~:text=click%20on%20arrow%20button%20in,click%20%e2%80%9csend%20moons%e2%80%9d)hopefully this guide of mine can help fill in any blanks or give you an alternate route. please note this is a long and fairly complex process and runs the risk of loosing moons and small amounts of ethereum and dai which are used in the transfer process. i take no responsibility for individuals using this guide and it is up to you to research other resources and do your due diligence.&amp;#x200b;1. post engaging content, comments or memes...2. hope that you get upvotes3. the more upvotes you get, the more moons (a cryptocurrency token) at the end of the month you get4. these moons are tokens on the rinkeby test network, not the main ethereum blockchain5. now time to convert these moons to ethereum, bitcoin, fiat etc6. please note that i am not responsible for any loss of funds beyond this point to proceed with caution!!!7. you will want to link your reddit moons account to a metamask account8. download metamask if you haven't already (it's a chrome app)9. find out the seed phrase for your reddit moons wallet (don't share this with anyone and keep it safe!). do this by opening the reddit app and clicking on 'vault' on the left hand menu10. then click the three little dots next to vault (at the top)11. now click recovery phrase12. write this down with pen and paper13. now open metamask and import your seed phrase to link the account (note that your moons will probably not appear yet, will get to that later)14. next up we are going to want to go to the exchange where we can swap our moon tokens for eth (although it is not as straightforward a process as you might think)1. [https://xmoon.exchange/](https://xmoon.exchange/)15. you will see that this exchange has three sections. the first allows us to exchange moons (on the rinkeby blockchain) to xmoons (on the xdai blockchain, where gas fees are paid in xdai rather than eth). the second section allows us to exchange xmoons for xdai. the third section allows us to exchange xdai for good old fashioned ethereum (on the actual ethereum blockchain).16. before we get started with any exchanging, we need to configure metamask a bit.17. first up we are going to make metamask show the moons that we have. to do this, change the network from 'main ethereum network' to 'rinkeby test network' at the top dropdown menu. now click 'add token' and custom token. now input the following:1.  token contract address:  0xdf82c9014f127243ce1305dfe54151647d74b27a2. click next once3. now click back (weird i know)4. in the decimals of precision enter 1818. you should now be able to see the correct number of moons and this should match the amount you saw on your vault in reddit19. in preparation for later we are also going to want to add the xdai network to our metamask20. to do this click on that drop down at the top of top of metamask again and click custom rpc21. now enter exactly what is shown here [https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup)22. still with me? now we are going to get to exchanging23. switch metamask back to rinkeby test network and on [xmoon.exchange](https://xmoon.exchange) click 'connect' and follow the instructions shown on metamask24. we are also going to need some rinkeby ethereum (don't worry it's free since its just a test network, go to [https://faucet.rinkeby.io/](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) to get some (don't need much)25. now click moon to xmoon and convert the amount you want to!26. this process can take quite a while (took me 30 mins) so grab a coffee27. to check if you have xmoons now, change your metamask over to xdai network28. they should appear on the [xmoon.exchange](https://xmoon.exchange) site29. next we want to convert these xmoon's into xdai, however, we have to have some xdai in there in the first place to pay for the gas (remember that this xdai blockchain uses xdai to pay for gas not eth!). to do this, buy some dai (20 usd should do) in your favourite way (normal exchange, defi, etc.) and transfer it to your metamask account eth account (on the main ethereum blockchain, don't use rinkeby!). also transfer around 10 usd worth of eth to your metamask to cover any gas fees on the main ethereum blockchain side of things.30. great, now while keeping metamask on the main ethereum blockchain, click dai to xdai and convert around10-20 usd.31. once this xdai has shown up (again could take a while), switch metamask back over to xdai blockchain and click xmoon to xdai (this should be fairly quick)32. now click xdai to dai (might take a while again, don't panic like i did!)33. you should now have dai on the ethereum blockchain held in your metamask (which you can see once you switch metamask back over to main ethereum)34. feel free now to do with the dai whatever you wish! send to an exchange and swap to btc or eth, keep a hold of in metamask etc etc&amp;#x200b;please feel free to offer comments and corrections in the comments :) [removed] [removed] [removed] am i the only one thinking these 100k% apy (even 1k% apy) "farms" in the eth defi ecosystem are a bunch of ponzi schemes?most are names after food (ridiculous), have almost 0 real value, crypto "influencers" that shill these could be considered scammers.i mean sure you could probably make a few hundred dollars here and there but you'll eventually be burnt or rug pulled.&amp;#x200b;thanks for listening to my evening rant - i can now finally relax. looking to pivot my due diligence crypto strategy and embody the autists of r/wallstreetbets to go full degen and get deep in moons, r/moonstreetbets if you will, as such can anyone please offer a guide on how to get from mainnet eth to my beloved moons? [removed] hello r/cryptocurrency redditors!this year has been exciting for cryptocurrencies. to accommodate for the recent subreddit interest and changes, we are proposing the following for feedback:### stricter content ruleswe have been extremely sensitive to the quality of subreddit content for a very long time. r/cryptocurrency needs to balance the views of thousands of subreddit communities while avoiding being overrun by memes, shilling, and fake news. this is a really delicate balancing act.[back in april 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrencymeta/comments/bguas5/important_mod_team_update_we_will_test_a_link/), we tested out a "whtelist-only" rule. link submissions could only come from whitelisted domains. we have not updated the [whitelist](https://np.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/wiki/whitelist) much since then.at this point, we would like to collect initial feedback on re-imposing this whitelist. in doing so, we will re-evaluate the existing domains and the domain whitelist review process. if you are familiar with those, you can leave specific comments as well.we have a few options for the whitelist. we can do one of the following (noting that all posts will be subject to quality standards, but stricter whitelists also help keep quality high):1. no change2. whitelist and self posts only. image domains still allowed in whitelist. this won't reduce image spam.3. whitelist and self posts only. restrict crossposts to r/cryptocurrencymemes and r/cryptotechnology. image submission blocked. all memes must be crossposted from r/cryptocurrencymemes, giving us finer control.the whitelisted domains and subreddits can be changed to what makes sense. the difference between 2 and 3 is mostly whether image posts are allowed to be posted directly or not.### trivia this friday at 5pm cdt!about a year ago, we started weekly r/cryptocurrency trivia, which was fun but also had limited participation. at the time, you only won a special flair. now however, you can win moons!1st place: 3000. 2nd: 2000. 3rd: 1000.join with your reddit username if you want to win coins! see you there!link: https://youtu.be/v4tlvbt1aha### securityfor some people, their reddit account is priceless. for others, it may literally be holding thousands of dollars of moons. you need to think about security.1. enable reddit's 2fa ***right now*** (at the bottom of [this page on desktop](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/)). we ***require*** that mods here enable 2fa since it's that important.2. use a password manager like keepassxc, lastpass, or keeper. secure those vaults with a super strong password that you memorize. then make sure your reddit, email, and other passwords are protected with crazy strings that you couldn't remember even if your life depended on it.3. make sure your reddit email is still valid, and check the password, recovery settings, and 2fa on that too.### merchandisewe fully plan to offer merchandise through a partner, who will accept payment in moons and will purchase and "burn" moons with some of the proceeds. what merchandise would you like to see? the r/cryptocurrency branding is awesome since it's so inclusive; what other logos refer to the entire ecosystem instead of just one project?what would you like to see r/cryptocurrency merchandise for? what designs would you like to see other than the subreddit logo? the moons logo and/or design? memes? bitconnect? so many new projects incentive adding their token to liquidity pools.  deposit shitcoin/eth and earn 1,111% apy! the apy is always much higher on the native shit token/eth pair than others.these great returns result in excess liquidity relative to trading volume. uniswap style swaps take the total liquidity into account, and if you have tons of liquidity, you can sell very large batches of tokens without the price moving much at all. in other words, people with big bags (project devs, etc...) can dump on you without completely crashing the price.most of your remember sushi anon founder dumping his giant stack of sushi and the panic led to a big crash in price. weeks later, they actually did a market buy of $14m worth of sushi and the price didn't even go up. imagine that, buying 14 million dollars worth of a shit coin and the price doesn't moon...that is how big of an impact liquidity has on uniswap style pools.so if a project is giving away high apy for staking their token, it not only means they can dump on you, it means that the price is going to be very difficult to pump as well. this is why so many projects are doing this, and why you should be very wary if they are. [removed] i want to start a career in coding, specifically crypto related coding, but i'm not sure where or how to start. i have zero knowledge in coding or computer science, so i'll be starting as a complete beginner.&amp;#x200b;at the moment i'm trying to start my search by nailing down a good language to learn, how/where to learn said language, and what crypto community has good jobs available (btc, eth, ltc, altcoins, etc).&amp;#x200b;would anyone have any suggestions on in-demand coding languages, good ways of learning a language, and/or a field in crypto that i should look into?&amp;#x200b;any advice or suggestions are greatly appreciated ! [removed] i cant find the vault on my account and im not sure what im doing wrong, i know where its supposed to be and what its supposed to look like but its not there. ive updated and restarted the app several times, tried switching between accounts and tried going to other users profiles to try and tip them moons to see if that would fix the issue as someone suggested but that option was not available to me either.anyone encounter this problem that knows a fix? i just started my infosec career, and while ive been invested in crypto since 2015 i would like to take on my own projects outside work revolving around blockchain and privacy.so i would like to know the steps you take from cashing in to cashing out with privacy in mind.what crypto do you use?what wallets?use of vpn / encrypted email?process of transferring it / swapsdm if youd like, thanks! [removed] so as per whale watcher, the stolen funds are now in multiple exchange, and the transfer are going on since yesterday and no one is talking about this not kucoin nor the exchange where the crypto is sent.&amp;#x200b;[https://whale-alert.io/transaction/ripple/870e2555ce8e58df3b84512b080c18d29d1edca84e4de73e2dd6e2799f4b1a48](https://whale-alert.io/transaction/ripple/870e2555ce8e58df3b84512b080c18d29d1edca84e4de73e2dd6e2799f4b1a48)&amp;#x200b;what's going on ? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] so i've been putting off claiming my accumulated moons for a few months, assuming that it would be complicated and take some thinking and effort.wrong.  i just did it.  it took about 7 minutes in total:step 1:  download the mobile app (most of you probably already use it, although i was using desktop only).step 2:  click on your profile photo, click on vault.step 3:  click "set up"step 4:  write down a manual 12-word backup phrase, so you don't lose access in the future if you throw your phone in the toilet.step 5:  click "claim moons" - this was one of the slowest parts of the process, because it took almost 60 seconds before the moons were claimed.so if you're lazy like i was, you no longer have any excuse not to set up your vault. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] the office of the comptroller of the currencyissued another letteropening the door for morebanks to be accommodating to the crypto industry.with this info, and that executives from visa publicly stating that "digital assets and blockchain technology will beimportant parts of the credit giants future."do you think this will lead to more widespread adoption of crypto?source: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cryptoconfidential/2020/09/27/bitcoin-ether-slump-banks-can-now-back-stablecoins/#1d40ac3164d2 [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] since the second corona wave is on its way, at least here in europe, do you guys think bitcoin will hold strong or is the market still bound to the stock market?because i got the feeling that we will be seeing another crash especially in the stock market since most countries will need to have another lock down. hello alli had no time recently to read alllll the infos available for the defi environment. i saw some token named after food (sashimi sushi and stuff), i saw yfi and some other too.i have some money in standard crypto (btc eth xmr iota ect) and i would like to differsify into defi.what quality project are out there ? wich one are really inovative ? why ? please dont shill but explain with links why this or this defi project is the futur.thanks ya all !

[removed] if you make a second reddit vault it overrides the first one and you have to restore from backup to recover the original vault. that wouldnt be so bad if you properly backed up your vault, however i have seen multiple people say they didnt or they cant remember their password. their coins are gone and reddit likely cant do anything to save them.please take a few minutes to ensure youve backed it up properly. i thought i would write this up to help any newcomers or anyone interested in learning some new perspectives and ethics that keep me grounded and excited in this revolutionary era of crypto and decentralized currency we are currently living in.i am not by any means an expert but i do have my own code i stick by within this space. hopefully this is enlightening for some, although some may think these points are common sense. really this is my foundation that makes me feel comfortable and confident in my judgement when investing into great cryptocurrency projects...&amp;#x200b;* do your best to suppress the fomo urges and mindsets and also try not to domo (dwell on missing out) these feelings are negative, self defeating and will just cause anyone a lot of irrational unnecessary stress.  who cares if joe blow dumped 300 hundred dollars into some random new "shit coin" and made millions! good for him, it was a one off and this isnt about his future its about yours. chanting "coulda woulda shouldas" is not the disposition to have when wanting to invest in cryptocurrency.&amp;#x200b;* anytime is a usually a good time to start investing in cryptocurrency. pick an good reputable exchange to start with and test it out.&amp;#x200b;* find projects you like. look for the positive ethics and innovation behind the project and also who the creators and custodians of the projects are. some of them are really interesting people who follow a code of their own ethics.dd or due diligence applies to crypto/defi  projects similar as it does to investing in the stock market. investigate. gather as much information on a specific project you are interested in is probably the biggest attribute to having success and watching your finances grow.1. is the crypto technology improving or innovating something that benefits people or the space?2. does the project promote positive community values and growth opportunity?3. are the management teams behind the projects talented and of good character?4. does the crypto have a good foundation to thrive off of as it grows?these are the main things i look for when doing my dd on any crypto.&amp;#x200b;* when you research your chosen projects dig deep and be cautious of  crazy hype promotions or biased articles on "these next 3 big cryptos and defi will moon in 2021!!!!1" trust your research and sound judgement based on the facts not on knee jerk emotions \*\*\*\*this is actually really hard for me sometimes because i get really emotional when it comes to things i am passionate about but having a logical mindset will reward you and then you can be emotional and cheer about [it.lol](https://it.lol).&amp;#x200b;* have a solid financial foundation when you decide to invest in multiple crypto. i tend to keep the majority of my capital in etherem as it is a proven product with a great track record that many other cryptos rely on...it isn't going anywhere. that said, it is good to diversify and try fledgling projects for great opportunities and it doesn't matter how little you invest - testing the waters is a great way to get an idea of how the project will start to perform.&amp;#x200b;* we hear this one a lot: "just hodl!"  while holding is great so is variety and trading at certian times. be on the lookout for indicators relating to the crypto market fluctuations such as a passing vote, public announcements from the managing teams and exchanges, new tech or software upgrades, even world events that could effect the value of the crypto you want to buy hold or sell. these are indicators or catalysts to always be looking for and will help you make better buying selling and trading choices with crypto.&amp;#x200b;* "dont spend what you cant afford to lose" we see this a lot as well and while it is a good rule to follow, sometimes by taking risks we are greatly rewarded. so i say to this, yes follow that rule but also expand and evolve as crypto holder. this will mean taking some risks and then following the previous mentioned principles to mitigate that risk further.&amp;#x200b;* cutting losses. this is a tough one. everyone has their own stop loss ideology or limit to which they feel they can tolerate. i would say if you were going to cut your losses do it for a reason that makes sense. a coin drops %30 percent today...that isnt a good reason. the reason is why did it fall that 30%, is it the market? some sort of halving event, just the market its self ebbing and flowing. the point i am getting to is try to avoid rash decisions simply based on a percentage loss. find the truth behind it and then act accordingly based on the facts. i have held through countless drops in the last several months and usually it just takes a bit of time to wait out the market re-calibrations and corrections as most of the time these bounce back and even better than before.&amp;#x200b;* i think the most important rule of all is again, **remember to have fun**. even when i see i am down for the week it just gets me excited for the next or even a potential buy opportunity on the dip. it is a chaotic up and down game. but if you can find some comfort and reason within that, then it can be really exciting and rewarding. have fun and be passionate in the projects you believe will succeed, knowledge share and teach others things you have discovered. passing on valid information can help others be successful and that is often a key component of a project becoming reliable and strong. great crypto communities backing a good crypto project go hand in hand. support each other and drive for success this can and will most certainly create some moons in the process.good hunting to everyone and i wish you all great wealth in your endeavors!

DOWN //POSTDATACOMPILED// at https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ website there is a box labeled bip39 seed.when you generate a mnemonic phrase the bip39 seed is also generated. usually a random string of numbers and letters. but you can input your own characters too. so i thought about what to input; something that wouldn't change over time and that i could access again in the future. i found this.using the hex format (0-9,a-f,a-f) you can enter 32 - 128 characters, 2 digits at a time and derive addresses. you can type in 128 zeros and i can also type in 128 zeros and we get the same address and key.example:32  zeros34  zeros36  zeros38  zeros40  zerosup to128 zeros, ones, twos, threes etc.at first i thought wow this is amazing. now i think it is just a cesspool of bitcoin keys. ones' that should never be used for btc wallets.  any thoughts?

[removed] \&gt; in light of the emerging threat of powerful quantum computers appearing in the near future, we investigate the potential attacks on bitcoin available to a quantum-capable adversary. in particular, we illustrate how shors quantum algorithm can be used to forge ecdsa based signatures, allowing attackers to hijack transactions. we then propose a simple commitdelayreveal protocol, which allows users to securely move their funds from non-quantum-resistant outputs to those adhering to a quantum-resistant digital signature scheme. in a previous paper(stewart et al. r. soc. open sci. 5(6), 180410 (2018)) \[[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-37110-4_9#cr1)\] we presented a similar scheme with a long fixed delay. here we improve on our previous work, by allowing each user to choose their preferred delaylong for a low risk of attack, or short if a higher risk is acceptable to that user. as before, our scheme requires modifications to the bitcoin protocol, but once again these can be implemented as a soft fork.&amp;#x200b;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-37110-4\_9](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-37110-4_9)&amp;#x200b;isn't every update could be a soft or a hard fork? do i simply purchase things? tip people? is there a list of popular channels to connect to? im looking to really get into crypto/bitcoin, and have been researching for a little bit now, but im  still a bit unsure and im looking for someone to guide me. not to do everything for me but just to get me started.. anyone? i run a civil engineering business in the us, and have been including a note on my invoices that i accept crypto and there's a 10% discount if they pay in crypto. unsurprisingly, i've had no takers (since 2013!) i'm thinking maybe it'd be a good idea to include a qr code on each invoice, a payment qr code to a wallet, in the amount of 10% less than the invoice. the qr code would provide visibility (no one reads fine print) and if someone scans it it would take them to the edge of the crypto rabbit hole.is there a good tool for doing this? i imagine the wallet for the code would have to be a btc wallet, but if they called me and wanted to pay in some other currency, i could set it up. the tool would need to run on pc, since i create my invoices in excel. https://imgur.com/gallery/c79vf0u https://imgur.com/gallery/c79vf0u my transaction has been unconfirmed for almost two days because my stupid ass chose the smallest fee available. i can't use rbf because my wallet is on mycelium and there's no such function there. i can't wait for 2-3 weeks for the transaction to be forgotten to start again, is there anything i can do? i just found a bitcoin wallet private key that i saved in 2013. jan 7, 2013, 7:51 pm, to be exact. bitcoin was at the price of 8 dollars when i stored this key... any investment i made then would be 13000x.&amp;#x200b;how much do you think i spent? i was \~13 at the time. check for yourself!nothing.13b2gdwysx5tkttk4kmkflvzciqns5cwqvfomo. anyways, continuing looking through my spare hdd's to see if i might find anything.. had a family member store a cd with a private key on it, but they've thrown it out. today, there was a new article that sprung up about how d wave now has the first commercial quantum computer for businesses with 5,000 qubits. how large of a quantum computer would be needed to bust into peoples wallets? how close are we to that happening? com.greenaddress.errorevery time i try to send, before sms/email confirmation; ive got this message. ive reinstalled and updated yet nothing. ive reached out to support but no replies on what the actual error is. their site and forums dont look updated often. no response. can someone help? is this wallet dead??

[removed] currently most exchanges has a fixed network fee. in some cases this fixed network fee is actually the same for complete different crypto currencies as well.recently paxos introduced a $5 fixed network fee on all crypto currencies (including ltc which should be about 1000 times cheaper). exchanges that does this is usually looking to profit on transactions (which in my opinion should be break-even).crypto.com has fixed in kind network fees like for example 0.004 btc, 0.006 eth and 5 usdt. these are the same no matter what the current situation in the network would suggest. this is a little better since it is different for each crypto currency, but it is still pretty clear that the motivation is to pay a lower network fee than you charge the customer and profit the difference.others like uphold and some wallets will adjust the fee in a way that makes it likely to be included in the next block without overpaying too much, but doesnt allow you to send a cheaper transaction when you arent in a hurry. to be clear i dont mind this being the default, but it would not hurt the exchange/wallet at all to allow customized fees since they arent usually keeping any of it for themselves anyways with this system.then there is a very popular system used by a lot of wallets and a few exchanges. they allow you to choose between different speeds (slow, regular, fast, etc) and automatically adjust the fee to match that. this is better than most other systems, but still not fully customizable. again it would not hurt the exchanges to allow true customization.i dont know why fully customizable network fees arent the industry standard, but it really needs to be.can we all just collectively demand support for custom network fees from all exchanges, wallets and other platforms?

[community points](https://reddit.com/community-points) are a way for users to be rewarded for their contributions to the subreddit, and they can be used on premium features in the community.moons are distributed every 4 weeks based on contributions people make to r/cryptocurrency. for every distribution, reddit publishes karma data as a default measure of contribution. the community can review the data and optionally propose an alternative distribution, if they wish.[here is the karma data for this round.](https://reddit-meta-production.s3.amazonaws.com/distribution/publish/cryptocurrency/round_5_proposed.csv)to propose an alternative distribution:* you can create a csv with alternative contribution scores or propose changes to the algorithm used to calculate them from karma (as long as the changes can be implemented easily).* the amount of moons distributed to a user will be proportional to their contribution score. contribution scores cannot be negative.* make a poll to have the community vote on your proposal. include an accurate description of the changes you are proposing.* if the poll meets quorum (20% of moons need to vote in it) and passes (according to the weighted results), it becomes the official contribution measurement (unless there is evidence of abuse in the vote, such as bribery). algorithm changes will carry forward to future distributions.* in case of multiple polls passing, the one with the most moons cast in favor will be the official one.* if no alternative passes, the data provided here will become official.the contribution scores for this round will be finalized on 2020-10-07. any poll proposing an alternative needs to be completed by then.after the scores are finalized, reddit will sign the data and publish the final, official data. after that, people will be able to claim their moons through the vault in the reddit mobile app. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] so, in your opinions, is renbtc or wbtc btc? if not, sell me on why, and if so, sell me on why.please actually defend your positions.here are some examples:wbtc or renbtc could have rogue mintingthere could be a smart contract bugissuance of renbtc and wbtc is identical to btc, and they are fungible to btc, therefore they are btc.

[removed] if you have any money on hitbtc i owuld be careful. i got stuck there (with a full kyc) several times now. last flint is a non-working 2fa on their website that doesn't accept the reset code either. i don't have any funds there, so i'm ok. but asking to reset it ended up in them asking for so much unnecessary personal info about my transactions that i think its ridiculous (after already providing a bunch of extra selfies, docs, etc). be careful [removed] as i've been watching the latest developments in the crypto space and the thing i cant get over is the potential that nft's represent to the market place.  particularly in the enterprise space when it comes to verifying documents, securing ip, preventing fraud(specifically in ticketing), and in general finding a better way to monetize digital content in a way that allows for less restrictive drm.with that said, most projects i find seem to be playing the short game on nft's rather than trying to embrace the bigger opportunities in this market.   i dont mean to be dismissive of those and understand that is how tech works, in that it starts with a simple use case to prove itself before wider markets will consider adoption.i would love to hear about people favorite projects in this space and other thoughts people have on its potential to in the marketplace. [removed] it seems kucoin is bent on getting projects to fork or do a token swap if they were affected by the hack.  if projects claiming to be decentralized are participating in these activities, to me, it seems like they are in fact being exposed to centralized decision making.   i understand if you left crypto on exchanges you want it back, but that doesn't change the fact that a lot of these decisions could impact the so called decentralized projects.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] in response to the new post about merchandise pinned here, i was wondering would it be possible to create a custom r/cryptocurrency version of monopoly called (of course) **moonopoly!** christmas is just around the corner and it would make a great gift to a fellow crypto enthusiast, or could even be given out as prizes!&amp;nbsp;anyway, regardless of whether or not this is a good idea that can be taken seriously, or something completely ridiculous, i figured we could have some fun now deciding how this game would hypothetically be played and allocating the squares for the board. here are my ideas:"&amp;nbsp;"it would work just like normal monopoly which we're all familiar with. but instead of being handed out a set amount of $ or whatever, the **currency** for moonopoly could be dai/satoshis...or even moons!"&amp;nbsp;"instead of the **28 properties** we could have 28 cryptos. (just like in standard monopoly, their value doesn't have to be exact to real life.) bitcoin and etherum are the equivalent of the premium properties (mayfair and park lane on uk monopoly). perhaps nano could be old kent road (don't hate me nano fans, i love nano really. in fact nano could be the free parking square!)"&amp;nbsp;"so let's say you land on the bitcoin (mayfair) square and want to buy it. that will cost you 0.1 btc. if someone lands on it, they have to give you 0.01 btc. instead of building **houses and hotels**, you can add more bitcoins/eth etc, which would then increase the amount someone would have to pay when they land on your crypto."&amp;nbsp;"the **4 railroads** could be exchanges (binance, coinbase etc.) and perhaps the **two utilities** could be something defi like uniswap and honeyswap."&amp;nbsp;"we could have a lot of fun with the **chance** and **community chest** cards. here are some ideas:"&amp;nbsp;"-you entered your seed in a phishing site. pay 0.3 btc.-you've received an airdrop. collect 0.2 btc-binance has been hacked. pay 0.5 btc.-bullrun confirmed! collect 0.4 btc.-the ico you invested in has exit scammed. pay 0.2 btc.-you didn't file your crypto taxes. go to jail. don't pass go. don't collect 0.1 btc..."&amp;nbsp;"for the **pieces** (i.e. the dog, the boot, the hat..) we could have:-doge-carlos matos-bogdanoff-victor cobra?"&amp;nbsp;"alright, it might sound a bit silly. i mean who are we going to play this with? but let's not worry about that. i want to know, what would you have on your moonopoly board?

DOWN //POSTDATACOMPILED// hey just wondering if anyone has had much experience with crypto.com. i started buying mco because they have incredible interest rates on the coins you deposit with them. the debit card is super cool i enjoy 5% back in cro on all purchases and receive 100% back in cro for my netflix spotify and prime purchases. as i received more benefits from this platform, i saw an opportunity to convert a lot of dollars i had earned over the last few decades (mostly in property) into bitcoin and stablecoins like dai and tusd and earn 12% apy interest + 2% interest in cro. these are better returns than i have on most rental properties ive owned, without the headache of shitty tenants, asshole city council members, and constant maintenance and taxes. so when i had the cash at my disposal, i quickly and with velocity started purchasing large amounts of bitcoin ethereum dai paxos tusd through the crypto.com app and began making deposits. they upgraded my debit card. its cool. rose gold. i deposit tusd onto the card and it converts it to fiat and i go spend it and i get crypto back which earns 18% apy!! its great. all of a sudden, the bots and auto responders are asking for proof of source of my funds and that if i dont provide the documents, that it will impact my account. they wont even give me a phone call. they tell me and my tax attorney to email their support@crypto.com email. i talk to bots and auto responders. i get one of them on the chat and they say they need the documents for their report so they can stay compliant. i tell them that their report is of no concern to me. i report to the irs, i followed every agreement to purchase the crypto and use the platform. no brokerage account i have traded on has ever requested this information or documents as proof. if they needed the proof of my source of income or wealth, they should have asked before selling me the crypto.this whole exchange wouldnt bother me so much if i could just move my funds to my cold wallet. the worrisome thing is that they have control of everything thats still locked up in a 3 month deposit period. obviously i cant take those funds out until the term expired.i could dig up some of the documents theyre requesting, but i dont want to. like seriously, fuck them. i've just seen the joe rogan podcast about bitcoin and andreas antonopoulos was talking about a website where all fake news about bitcoin are collected, can you share this website?

[deleted] i was looking into a trading platform called alpinumcg. i signed up through bitcoin revolution and immediately after signing up, i received an email and a phone call from the uk. the lady on the phone told me to click the link on the email where it would lead me to put in my personal information (name, address) and my credit card information because i needed an initial 250 usd in order to open my account and start trading. i was sceptical at first but she reassured me and was rushing me into it because she said there was a promotion going on. my stupid self put my credit card information and it automatically charged my card. after that, she hung up not telling me what to expect.i get another email a couple hours later with login details to my trading account with alpinumcg. right when i logged into alpinumcg, i get another phone call from a financial advisor from alpinumcg and he told me the basics of the trading platform.i checked it out and saw that my funds were increasing and i thought it was working. but i went online to see reviews about this company and many people were saying it was a scam. i called them back and asked for a refund/withdrawal as well as to close my account and they said the financial team would call me back and do it for me.however a couple days passed and they never got back to me. so i tried to withdraw my deposit but it wouldnt let me. i called and emailed them multiple times with no response. ***i realize they just took my money and completely cut all communications with me.*** i even tried closing the account but it wouldnt let me do so because only the company had control over that.im planning to contact my bank to file a dispute and a chargeback as well as change my credit card but im scared that i cant close my account and they will charge me fees (like tax or hidden fees) as the funds keep increasing (even though i cant even withdraw it) or mail a bill to my house because they have my address.please help! i dont know what to do and im scared this will come back in the future to bite me. talk about buying the dip when we look at bitcoins adoption from the e-commerce standpoint it comes as no surprise that it has seen a sharp rise. merchants and customers alike around the world enjoy bitcoins borderless and control-free transactions.just like bitcoin, the landscape of merchants using bitcoin has changed over the years.a study was recently conducted to analyze the bitcoin merchant data and see how the market has evolved in the past years \[20172020\], leading to some interesting finds.\#1 **web hosting**, **pharma/health**, and **cannabis** take almost 75% of the entire bitcoin merchant ecosystem in 2020.\#2 industries that have embraced bitcoin are not just selling digital products but also physical goods.industries such as **cannabis**, **pharma/health**, **vaping** have seen a rise in adoption since 2017, and the trend is only going up.\#3 interestingly enough, **mining** is the one and only industry that sees a ***drop*** in adoption.\#4 the 3 industries that saw the highest growth rate in the year 2020 compared to 2019 were **cannabis, vaping, and vpn**.*vpn* saw the highest increase of 80%, followed by *vaping* with 64% and finally by *cannabis* with 54%.&amp;#x200b;what are your thoughts on how the bitcoin merchant market has changed?&amp;#x200b;source: [bitcoin market analysis \[2017-2020\]](https://blog.blockonomics.co/bitcoin-market-analysis-2020-2017-how-the-btc-market-has-changed-a-look-at-4-years-of-market-a976c42b4d2) want to win 1,000,000 [#satoshis](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/satoshis/) and a new honeybadger hodl hat?honeybadger is hosting a giveaway to celebrate 100+ bitcoin atm locations across canada.head over to twitter, instagram and facebook to find out how to enter:twitter: [https://twitter.com/badger\_coin/status/1311386043640414208](https://twitter.com/badger_coin/status/1311386043640414208)instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/p/cfxzgfzax0\_/](https://www.instagram.com/p/cfxzgfzax0_/)facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1453160588213681](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1453160588213681) [deleted] large institutional investors are starting to get into the market. many of them are trying to keep quite about what they are doing. they already own a lot of coins, so its easy for them to manipulate the market. if large institutions want to keep there average cost low, they have the ability to dump a few coins then slowly buy more than they dumped as the price slowly climbs. time to sell guys, sorry sometimes i run a space heater in the winter. just to top up small chilly spots.i was thinking of getting an old ant miner or something instead. what's the low cost way to burn about a kilowatt of power? i saw a post on instagram about bitcoin.

[removed] i'm looking around what could i buy with bitcoin i have 2 hard drives i am currently searching for a bitcoin wallet from when a friend introduced me to btc and we mined for fun a long time ago. estimated timeframe would have been 2010-2013 but most likely toward the earlier side. i do not recall any encryption.using regular recovery software i managed to find a handful of wallets however they turned out to be dogecoin wallets that i was able to recover some loose change out of, but not after having opened it in bitcoin core and giving myself a good boost of false hope -_- . the wallet.dat files i have recovered so far were created in 2013 and 2015, which i think must be all dogecoin as i had btc before i had any doge.i have been hesitant to post requesting help as i am sure it gets posted often enough, however, i feel out of options. here is what i have done so far:created forensic images of both drives so don't worry about thatdownloaded the whole bitcoin core and doge blockchains and tested the wallets i had recovered.recovered some dogetried to salvage the recovered wallets  that didn't open in both btc and doge walletssearching the wallets i have found for hex data for btc hex datasearched the images for '30 81 d3 02 01 01 04 20' and '30 82 01 13 02 01 01 04 20'if these hex strings are not present, is it safe to say the wallet no longer exists and should i not bother with pywallet? i was going to try pywallet anyway but all the forums i have been reading have dead links and am unsure if there is an official github anymore.thanks for any replies :) hi, i'm not that new to the space but i'm only 18 so haven't really put in a lot of money in because i don't have much. but i have about 60$ in eth and btc in different sites. should i buy a hardware wallet or is it ok to keep in websites until some time.the reason i asked was hardware wallets are somewhere around 50$(i might be wrong). but is it worth it to have a hardware wallet than on one the computer(website) bitcoin influencer davinci jeremies youtube account has been permanently deleted. your thoughts on this? hey guys, i started getting into bitcoin since the beginning of march and i've read/experienced how volatile it can be. i firstly planned to just buy a full coin and hold on to in the long term as i believe it has a lot of growth potential. but then i realised i could be doing shorter term trades and make more money.i know my strategy will not be the safest as i will buy once it dips and sell when it stagnates again (unless it breaks out of resistance zone etc.)i was hoping one of you more experienced traders could give me some advice on my strategy or some info on the fundamentals of short term bitcoin trades.i am a bitcoin noob basically so i am all ears.thanks for example i wanted to buy $50,000 and store it on my leadger nano x would this be considered stupid or should i look into a cold walletnoob question i know just want to know the limitations of these hardware wallets as you probably know, bitcoin is not quantum resistant. you can now buy [5000qbit](https://www.dwavesys.com/press-releases/d-wave-announces-general-availability-first-quantum-computer-built-business) computer for $15m and you can harness it's compute power for finding btc. i know that $15m is too much at the moment, but after a year or two, the price will be half probably. are there any plans for bitcoin in order to continue existing?

99.9%? $100,000 is not a lot to me to lose sleep over, i can take the loss. i dont see an issue with me leaving $100,000 in there for 3 years. i know im not supposed to, but is the chance of something happening less than 1 out of 1,000?

[removed] #before you downvote me for even mentioning taxes, please hear me out.i get it. we hate to acknowledge it. the laws are outdated and unfair in most countries and why should i pay taxes if i havent sold crypto back into fiat? im not here to tell you whether or not you should pay taxes on crypto or not, im just here to let you know the following:#tax authorities around the world have been making exchanges hand over data on who has been buying and selling crypto.the following countries have recently been going through this data and auditing cryptocurrency holders.united states: https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoin-tax-looms-irs-orders-coinbase-turn-over-user-data/australia: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-30/ato-ramps-up-data-matching-in-cryptocurrency-crackdown/11059446new zealand: https://nz.easycrypto.ai/blog/inland-revenue-info-request-to-nz-crypto-companies-sept-2020/**this is not an exhaustive list.** other countries will be doing the same and if you havent paid taxes yet i suggest you do some research into what the laws are and if your government is auditing cryptocurrency buyers and traders. if you pay taxes now, you will avoid bigger fines which are given for not disclosing you gains in crypto.**how do i know if i need to pay taxes?**it is fair to assume that if you have made any crypto trade where the value of your crypto when making this trade is greater than when you bought your crypto then you should be researching what your tax obligations are. a trade includes crypto to crypto trades such as selling btc for eth in most countries (it doesnt have to be back into us dollars or your local currency). for example, if you bought 1 btc for $5,000 and traded that 1 btc for eth when btc was worth $10,000, then you have made $5,000 in taxable income in most tax jurisdictions. however, this is not the case in all countries, so you should research your local laws to see if this applies to you.anyway, i hate to even discuss this because i think that most crypto tax laws are unfair and outdated but that doesnt change the fact that at some point you will have to pay them. ultimately, i would rather pay them now rather than have to pay them later with extra fines and fees for not paying them on time.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] tax liability is a major source of concern for anyone invested in bitcoin and other digital assets. in sum, some have described it as nothing short of a nightmare.but while some countries are putting pressure on investors and levying taxes on income and capital gains from bitcoin transactions, many are taking a different approachoften with the aim of promoting better adoption and innovation within the crypto industry. theyve implemented friendlier legislation, and allow investors to buy, sell, or hold digital assets with no tax liability.heres our list of the nine most crypto-friendly tax jurisdictions.1. belarusbelarus is taking an experimental approach to cryptocurrencies. in march 2018, a new law legalized cryptocurrency activities in the east european state, exempting individuals and businesses involved in them from taxes until 2023 (when it will come up for review.)under the law, mining and investing in cryptocurrencies are deemed personal investments, and so exempt from income tax and capital gains.the liberal laws aim to boost the development of a digital economy, and technological innovation. the country was recently ranked third in eastern europe and 19th globally in levels of p2p crypto trading.2. germanygermany offers a unique take on taxing digital currencies such as bitcoin. unlike most other states, europes biggest economy regards bitcoin as private money, as opposed to a currency, commodity, or stock.for german residents, any cryptocurrency held for over a year is tax-exempt, regardless of the amount. if the assets are held for less than a year, capital gains tax doesnt accrue on a sale, as long as the amount does not exceed 600 euros ($692).however, for businesses its a different matter; a startup incorporated in germany still needs to pay corporate income taxes on cryptocurrency gains, just as it would with any other asset.3. hong konghong kongs tax legislation on cryptocurrencies is a broad brush affair, even after new guidance was issued earlier this year.essentially, whether cryptocurrencies are taxed or not depends on their use, according to henri arslanian, a global crypto leader at pwc.if digital assets are bought for long-term investment purposes, any profits from disposal would not be chargeable to profits tax, he wrote in march when the directive was introduced. but he added that this doesnt apply to corporationstheir hong-kong sourced profits from cryptocurrency business activities are taxable.4. malaysiain malaysia, cryptocurrency transactions are currently tax-free, and cryptocurrencies dont qualify for capital gains tax, because digital currencies are not considered assets or legal tender by the authorities.but the law is currently fluid; it only applies to individual taxpayers, and businesses involved in cryptocurrency are subject to malaysian income tax.and things may soon change. mohamad fauzi saat, director of malaysias tax department said in 2018 that malaysia was committed to working towards issuing comprehensive guidelines on the tax treatment of cryptocurrency by the end of 2020.5. maltathe government of the so-called blockchain island recognizes bitcoin as a unit of account, medium of exchange, or a store of value.malta doesnt apply capital gains tax to long-held digital currencies like bitcoin, but crypto trades are considered similar to day trading in stocks or shares, and attract business income tax at the rate of 35%. however, this can be mitigated to between five percent and zero, through structuring options available under the maltese system.maltas fiscal guidelines, published in 2018, also discriminate between bitcoin and so-called financial tokens, equivalent to dividends, interest or premiums. the latter are treated as income and taxed at the applicable rate.6. portugalportugal has one of the most crypto-friendly tax regimes in the world.proceeds from the sale of cryptocurrencies by individuals have been tax-exempt since 2018, and cryptocurrency trading is not considered investment income (which is normally subject to a 28% tax rate.)however, businesses that accept digital currencies as payment for goods and services are liable to income tax.7. singaporecapital gains tax does not exist in singapore, so neither individuals nor corporations holding cryptocurrency are liable.but companies based in singapore are liable to income tax, if their core business is cryptocurrency trading, or if they accept cryptocurrency as payment.the authorities consider payment tokens such as bitcoin to be intangible property rather than legal tender, and payment in the cryptocurrency constitutes a barter trade where the goods and services are taxed, but not the payment token itself.8. sloveniaslovenia is another country that treats individuals and businesses separately under its cryptocurrency tax system.no capital gains tax is levied on individuals when they sell bitcoin, and gains are not considered income. however, companies that receive payment in cryptocurrencies, or through mining, are required to pay tax at the corporate rate.notably, the mediterranean country doesnt permit business operations in cryptocurrency alone (such as only accepting bitcoin as payment.)9. switzerlandits no surprise that switzerland, home to the innovation hub known as crypto valley, has one of the most forward-thinking tax policies too.cryptocurrency profits made by a qualified individual through investing and trading are treated as tax-exempt capital gains.for the complete link to the article - [click here](https://decrypt.co/43513/9-countries-that-dont-tax-bitcoin-gains) "digital assets hold great promise for our derivatives markets and for our economy, said chairman heath p. tarbert. for the united states to be a global leader in this space, it is imperative that we root out illegal activity like that alleged in this case. new and innovative financial products can flourish only if there is market integrity."[ctfc article](https://www.cftc.gov/pressroom/pressreleases/8270-20) [removed] # 2020 4q\~ more companies follow in microstrategys footsteps. rumors of more corporate treasurers investing in btc in boardrooms globally. a few listed large corporates announce accumulation of btc after their buddies have all bought in (board members, c-suite executives, family, and friends, etc.)\~ money printing does not stop as the deflationary force of technology is too severe;

overview## cosmoscosmos is a heterogeneous network of many independent parallel blockchains, each powered by classical bft consensus algorithms like tendermint. developers can easily build custom application specific blockchains, called zones, through the cosmos sdk framework. these zones connect to hubs, which are specifically designed to connect zones together.the vision of cosmos is to have thousands of zones and hubs that are interoperable through the inter-blockchain communication protocol (ibc). cosmos can also connect to other systems through peg zones, which are specifically designed zones that each are custom made to interact with another ecosystem such as ethereum and bitcoin. cosmos does not use sharding with each zone and hub being sovereign with their own validator set.for a more in-depth look at cosmos and provide more reference to points made in this article, please see my three part series  [part

polkadotpolkadot is a heterogeneous blockchain protocol that connects multiple specialised blockchains into one unified network. it achieves scalability through a sharding infrastructure with multiple blockchains running in parallel, called parachains, that connect to a central chain called the relay chain. developers can easily build custom application specific parachains through the substrate development framework.the relay chain validates the state transition of connected parachains, providing shared state across the entire ecosystem. if the relay chain must revert for any reason, then all of the parachains would also revert. this is to ensure that the validity of the entire system can persist, and no individual part is corruptible. the shared state makes it so that the trust assumptions when using parachains are only those of the relay chain validator set, and no other. interoperability is enabled between parachains through cross-chain message passing (xcmp) protocol and is also possible to connect to other systems through bridges, which are specifically designed parachains or parathreads that each are custom made to interact with another ecosystem such as ethereum and bitcoin. the hope is to have 100 parachains connect to the relay chain.for a more in-depth look at polkadot and provide more reference to points made in this article, please see my three part

avalancheavalanche is a platform of platforms, ultimately consisting of thousands of subnets to form a heterogeneous interoperable network of many blockchains, that takes advantage of the revolutionary avalanche consensus protocols to provide a secure, globally distributed, interoperable and trustless framework offering unprecedented decentralisation whilst being able to comply with regulatory requirements.avalanche allows anyone to create their own tailor-made application specific blockchains, supporting multiple custom virtual machines such as evm and wasm and written in popular languages like go (with others coming in the future) rather than lightly used, poorly-understood languages like solidity. this virtual machine can then be deployed on a custom blockchain network, called a subnet, which consist of a dynamic set of validators working together to achieve consensus on the state of a set of many blockchains where complex rulesets can be configured to meet regulatory compliance.avalanche was built with serving financial markets in mind. it has native support for easily creating and trading digital smart assets with complex custom rule sets that define how the asset is handled and traded to ensure regulatory compliance can be met. interoperability is enabled between blockchains within a subnet as well as between subnets. like cosmos and polkadot, avalanche is also able to connect to other systems through bridges, through custom virtual machines made to interact with another ecosystem such as ethereum and bitcoin.for a more in-depth look at avalanche and provide more reference to points made in this article, please see

polkadot and avalanchea frequent question i see being asked is how cosmos, polkadot and avalanche compare? whilst there are similarities there are also a lot of differences. this article is not intended to be an extensive in-depth list, but rather an overview based on some of the criteria **that i feel are most important**. for a more in-depth view **i recommend reading the articles for each of the projects linked above and coming to your own conclusions**. i want to stress that its not a case of one platform being the killer of all other platforms, far from it. there wont be one platform to rule them all, and too often the tribalism has plagued this space. blockchains are going to completely revolutionise most industries and have a profound effect on the world we know today. its still very early in this space with most adoption limited to speculation and trading mainly due to the limitations of blockchain and current iteration of ethereum, which all three of these platforms hope to address. **for those who just want a quick summary see the image at the bottom of the article**. with that said lets have a look# scalability## cosmoseach zone and hub in cosmos is capable of up to around 1000 transactions per second with bandwidth being the bottleneck in consensus. cosmos aims to have thousands of zones and hubs all connected through ibc. there is no limit on the number of zones / hubs that can be created## polkadotparachains in polkadot are also capable of up to around 1500 transactions per second. a portion of the parachain slots on the relay chain will be designated as part of the parathread pool, the performance of a parachain is split between many parathreads offering lower performance and compete amongst themselves in a per-block auction to have their transactions included in the next relay chain block. the number of parachains is limited by the number of validators on the relay chain, they hope to be able to achieve 100 parachains.## avalancheavalanche is capable of around 4500 transactions per second per subnet, this is based on modest hardware requirements to ensure maximum decentralisation of just 2 cpu cores and 4 gb of memory and with a validator size of over 2,000 nodes. performance is cpu-bound and if higher performance is required then more specialised subnets can be created with higher minimum requirements to be able to achieve 10,000 tps+ in a subnet. avalanche aims to have thousands of subnets (each with multiple virtual machines / blockchains) all interoperable with each other. there is no limit on the number of subnets that can be created.## resultsall three platforms offer vastly superior performance to the likes of bitcoin and ethereum 1.0. avalanche with its higher transactions per second, no limit on the number of subnets / blockchains that can be created and the consensus can scale to potentially millions of validators all participating in consensus scores . polkadot claims to offer more tps than cosmos, but is limited to the number of parachains (around 100) whereas with cosmos there is no limit on the number of hubs / zones that can be created. cosmos is limited to a fairly small validator size of around 200 before performance degrades whereas polkadot hopes to be able to reach 1000 validators in the relay chain (albeit only a small number of validators are assigned to each parachain). thus cosmos and polkadot scoreshttps://preview.redd.it/ththwq5qdhq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92f75152c90d984911db88ed174ebf3a147ca70d# decentralisation## cosmostendermint consensus is limited to around 200 validators before performance starts to degrade. whilst there is the cosmos hub it is one of many hubs in the network and there is no central hub or limit on the number of zones / hubs that can be created.## polkadotpolkadot has 1000 validators in the relay chain and these are split up into a small number that validate each parachain (minimum of 14). the relay chain is a central point of failure as all parachains connect to it and the number of parachains is limited depending on the number of validators (they hope to achieve 100 parachains). due to the limited number of parachain slots available, significant sums of dot will need to be purchased to win an auction to lease the slot for up to 24 months at a time. thus likely to lead to only those with enough funds to secure a parachain slot. parathreads are however an alternative for those that require less and more varied performance for those that cant secure a parachain slot.## avalancheavalanche consensus scan scale to tens of thousands of validators, even potentially millions of validators all participating in consensus through repeated sub-sampling. the more validators, the faster the network becomes as the load is split between them. there are modest hardware requirements so anyone can run a node and there is no limit on the number of subnets / virtual machines that can be created.## resultsavalanche offers unparalleled decentralisation using its revolutionary consensus protocols that can scale to millions of validators all participating in consensus at the same time. there is no limit to the number of subnets and virtual machines that can be created, and they can be created by anyone for a small fee, it scores . cosmos is limited to 200 validators but no limit on the number of zones / hubs that can be created, which anyone can create and scores . polkadot hopes to accommodate 1000 validators in the relay chain (albeit these are split amongst each of the parachains). the number of parachains is limited and maybe cost prohibitive for many and the relay chain is a ultimately a single point of failure. whilst definitely not saying its centralised and it is more decentralised than many others, just in comparison between the three, it scoreshttps://preview.redd.it/lv2h7g9sdhq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56eada6e8c72dbb4406d7c5377ad15608bcc730e# latency## cosmostendermint consensus used in cosmos reaches finality within 6 seconds. cosmos consists of many zones and hubs that connect to each other. communication between 2 zones could pass through many hubs along the way, thus also can contribute to latency times depending on the path taken as explained in [part two](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/cosmos-an-early-in-depth-analysis-at-the-ecosystem-of-connected-blockchains-part-two-2d5a9886166) of the articles on cosmos. it doesnt need to wait for an extended period of time with risk of rollbacks.## polkadotpolkadot provides a hybrid consensus protocol consisting of block producing protocol, babe, and then a finality gadget called grandpa that works to agree on a chain, out of many possible forks, by following some simpler fork choice rule. rather than voting on every block, instead it reaches agreements on chains. as soon as more than 2/3 of validators attest to a chain containing a certain block, all blocks leading up to that one are finalized at once.if an invalid block is detected after it has been finalised then the relay chain would need to be reverted along with every parachain. this is particularly important when connecting to external blockchains as those dont share the state of the relay chain and thus cant be rolled back. the longer the time period, the more secure the network is, as there is more time for additional checks to be performed and reported but at the expense of finality. finality is reached within 60 seconds between parachains but for external ecosystems like ethereum their state obviously cant be rolled back like a parachain and so finality will need to be much longer (60 minutes was suggested in the whitepaper) and discussed in more detail in [part three](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/polkadot-an-early-in-depth-analysis-part-three-limitations-and-issues-d8b0a795a3e)## avalancheavalanche consensus achieves finality within 3 seconds, with most happening sub 1 second, immutable and completely irreversible. any subnet can connect directly to another without having to go through multiple hops and any vm can talk to another vm within the same subnet as well as external subnets. it doesnt need to wait for an extended period of time with risk of rollbacks.## resultswith regards to performance far too much emphasis is just put on tps as a metric, the other equally important metric, if not more important with regards to finance is latency. throughput measures the amount of data at any given time that it can handle whereas latency is the amount of time it takes to perform an action. its pointless saying you can process more transactions per second than visa when it takes 60 seconds for a transaction to complete. low latency also greatly increases general usability and customer satisfaction, nowadays everyone expects card payments, online payments to happen instantly. avalanche achieves the best results scoring , cosmos with comes in second with 6 second finality  and polkadot with 60 second finality (which may be 60 minutes for external blockchains) scoreshttps://preview.redd.it/qe8e5ltudhq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18a2866104590f81a818690337f9121161dda890# shared security## cosmosevery zone and hub in cosmos has their own validator set and different trust assumptions. cosmos are researching a shared security model where a hub can validate the state of connected zones for a fee but not released yet. once available this will make shared security optional rather than mandatory.## polkadotshared security is mandatory with polkadot which uses a shared state infrastructure between the relay chain and all of the connected parachains. if the relay chain must revert for any reason, then all of the parachains would also revert. every parachain makes the same trust assumptions, and as such the relay chain validates state transition and enables seamless interoperability between them. in return for this benefit, they have to purchase dot and win an auction for one of the available parachain slots.however, parachains cant just rely on the relay chain for their security, they will also need to implement censorship resistance measures and utilise proof of work / proof of stake for each parachain as well as discussed in [part three](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/polkadot-an-early-in-depth-analysis-part-three-limitations-and-issues-d8b0a795a3e), thus parachains cant just rely on the security of the relay chain, they need to ensure sybil resistance mechanisms using pow and pos are implemented on the parachain as well.## avalanchea subnet in avalanche consists of a dynamic set of validators working together to achieve consensus on the state of a set of **many** blockchains where complex rulesets can be configured to meet regulatory compliance. so unlike in cosmos where each zone / hub has their own validators, a subnet can validate a single or many virtual machines / blockchains with a single validator set. shared security is optional## resultsshared security is mandatory in polkadot and a key design decision in its infrastructure. the relay chain validates the state transition of all connected parachains and thus scores . subnets in avalanche can validate state of either a single or many virtual machines. each subnet can have their own token and shares a validator set, where complex rulesets can be configured to meet regulatory compliance. it scores  . every zone and hub in cosmos has their own validator set / token but research is underway to have the hub validate the state transition of connected zones, but as this is still early in the research phase scores  for now.https://preview.redd.it/0mnvpnzwdhq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8927ff2821415817265be75c59261f83851a2791# current adoption## cosmosthe cosmos project started in 2016 with an ico held in april 2017. there are currently around 50 projects building on the cosmos sdk with a full list can be seen [here](https://cosmonauts.world/) and filtering for cosmos sdk . not all of the projects will necessarily connect using native cosmos sdk and ibc and some have forked parts of the cosmos sdk and utilise the tendermint consensus such as binance chain but have said they will connect in the future.## polkadotthe polkadot project started in 2016 with an ico held in october 2017. there are currently around 70 projects building on substrate and a full list can be seen here and filtering for substrate based. like with cosmos not all projects built using substrate will necessarily connect to polkadot and parachains or parathreads arent currently implemented in either the live or test network (kusama) as of the time of this writing.## avalancheavalanche in comparison started much later with ava labs being founded in 2018. avalanche held its ico in july 2020. due to lot shorter time it has been in development, the number of projects confirmed are smaller with around 14 projects currently building on avalanche. due to the customisability of the platform though, many virtual machines can be used within a subnet making the process incredibly easy to port projects over. as an example, it will launch with the ethereum virtual machine which enables byte for byte compatibility and all the tooling like metamask, truffle etc. will work, so projects can easily move over to benefit from the performance, decentralisation and low gas fees offered. in the future cosmos and substrate virtual machines could be implemented on avalanche.## resultswhilst its still early for all 3 projects (and the entire blockchain space as a whole), there is currently more projects confirmed to be building on cosmos and polkadot, mostly due to their longer time in development. whilst cosmos has fewer projects, zones are implemented compared to polkadot which doesnt currently have parachains. ibc to connect zones and hubs together is due to launch q2 2021, thus both score . avalanche has been in development for a lot shorter time period, but is launching with an impressive feature set right from the start with ability to create subnets, vms, assets, nfts, permissioned and permissionless blockchains, cross chain atomic swaps within a subnet, smart contracts, bridge to ethereum etc. applications can easily port over from other platforms and use all the existing tooling such as metamask / truffle etc but benefit from the performance, decentralisation and low gas fees offered. currently though just based on the number of projects in comparison it scores .https://preview.redd.it/rsctxi6zdhq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff762dea3cfc2aaaa3c8fc7b1070d5be6759aac2# enterprise adoption## cosmoscosmos enables permissioned and permissionless zones which can connect to each other with the ability to have full control over who validates the blockchain. for permissionless zones each zone / hub can have their own token and they are in control who validates.## polkadotwith polkadot the state transition is performed by a small randomly selected assigned group of validators from the relay chain plus with the possibility that state is rolled back if an invalid transaction of any of the other parachains is found. this may pose a problem for enterprises that need complete control over who performs validation for regulatory reasons. in addition due to the limited number of parachain slots available enterprises would have to acquire and lock up large amounts of a highly volatile asset (dot) and have the possibility that they are outbid in future auctions and find they no longer can have their parachain validated and parathreads dont provide the guaranteed performance requirements for the application to function.## avalancheavalanche enables permissioned and permissionless subnets and complex rulesets can be configured to meet regulatory compliance. for example a subnet can be created where its mandatory that all validators are from a certain legal jurisdiction, or they hold a specific license and regulated by the sec etc. subnets are also able to scale to tens of thousands of validators, and even potentially millions of nodes, all participating in consensus so every enterprise can run their own node rather than only a small amount. enterprises dont have to hold large amounts of a highly volatile asset, but instead pay a fee in avax for the creation of the subnets and blockchains which is burnt.## resultsavalanche provides the customisability to run private permissioned blockchains as well as permissionless where the enterprise is in control over who validates the blockchain, with the ability to use complex rulesets to meet regulatory compliance, thus scores . cosmos is also able to run permissioned and permissionless zones / hubs so enterprises have full control over who validates a blockchain and scores . polkadot requires locking up large amounts of a highly volatile asset with the possibility of being outbid by competitors and being unable to run the application if the guaranteed performance is required and having to migrate away. the relay chain validates the state transition and can roll back the parachain should an invalid block be detected on another parachain, thus scores

through its ibc protocol (due to release in q1 2020). connecting to blockchains outside of the cosmos ecosystem would either require the connected blockchain to fork their code to implement ibc or more likely a custom peg zone will be created specific to work with a particular blockchain its trying to bridge to such as ethereum etc. each zone and hub has different trust levels and connectivity between 2 zones can have different trust depending on which path it takes (this is discussed more in [this article](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/cosmos-an-early-in-depth-analysis-at-the-ecosystem-of-connected-blockchains-part-two-2d5a9886166)). finality time is low at 6 seconds, but depending on the number of hops, this can increase significantly.## polkadotpolkadots shared state means each parachain that connects shares the same trust assumptions, of the relay chain validators and that if one blockchain needs to be reverted, all of them will need to be reverted. interoperability is enabled between parachains through cross-chain message passing (xcmp) protocol and is also possible to connect to other systems through bridges, which are specifically designed parachains or parathreads that each are custom made to interact with another ecosystem such as ethereum and bitcoin. finality time between parachains is around 60 seconds, but longer will be needed (initial figures of 60 minutes in the whitepaper) for connecting to external blockchains. thus limiting the appeal of connecting two external ecosystems together through polkadot. polkadot is also limited in the number of parachain slots available, thus limiting the amount of blockchains that can be bridged. parathreads could be used for lower performance bridges, but the speed of future blockchains is only going to increase.## avalanchea subnet can validate multiple virtual machines / blockchains and all blockchains within a subnet share the same trust assumptions / validator set, enabling cross chain interoperability. interoperability is also possible between any other subnet, with the hope avalanche will consist of thousands of subnets. each subnet may have a different trust level, but as the primary network consists of all validators then this can be used as a source of trust if required. as avalanche supports many virtual machines, bridges to other ecosystems are created by running the connected virtual machine. there will be an ethereum bridge using the evm shortly after mainnet. finality time is much faster at sub 3 seconds (with most happening under 1 second) with no chance of rolling back so more appealing when connecting to external blockchains.## resultsall 3 systems are able to perform interoperability within their ecosystem and transfer assets as well as data, as well as use bridges to connect to external blockchains. cosmos has different trust levels between its zones and hubs and can create issues depending on which path it takes and additional latency added. polkadot provides the same trust assumptions for all connected parachains but has long finality and limited number of parachain slots available. avalanche provides the same trust assumptions for all blockchains within a subnet, and different trust levels between subnets. however due to the primary network consisting of all validators it can be used for trust. avalanche also has a much faster finality time with no limitation on the number of blockchains / subnets / bridges that can be created. overall all three blockchains excel with interoperability within their ecosystem and each score .https://preview.redd.it/l775gue3ehq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7c4b5802ceb1a9307bd2a8d65f393d1bcb0d7c6# tokenomics## cosmosthe atom token is the native token for the cosmos hub. it is commonly mistaken by people that think its the token used throughout the cosmos ecosystem, whereas its just used for one of many hubs in cosmos, each with their own token. currently atom has little utility as ibc isnt released and has no connections to other zones / hubs. once ibc is released zones may prefer to connect to a different hub instead and so atom is not used. atom isnt a fixed capped supply token and supply will continuously increase with a yearly inflation of around 10% depending on the % staked. the current market cap for atom as of the time of this writing is $1 billion with 203 million circulating supply. rewards can be earnt through staking to offset the dilution caused by inflation. delegators can also get slashed and lose a portion of their atom should the validator misbehave.## polkadotpolkadots native token is dot and its used to secure the relay chain. each parachain needs to acquire sufficient dot to win an auction on an available parachain lease period of up to 24 months at a time. parathreads have a fixed fee for registration that would realistically be much lower than the cost of acquiring a parachain slot and compete with other parathreads in a per-block auction to have their transactions included in the next relay chain block. dot isnt a fixed capped supply token and supply will continuously increase with a yearly inflation of around 10% depending on the % staked. the current market cap for dot as of the time of this writing is $4.4 billion with 852 million circulating supply. delegators can also get slashed and lose their dot (potentially 100% of their dot for serious attacks) should the validator misbehave.## avalancheavax is the native token for the primary network in avalanche. every validator of any subnet also has to validate the primary network and stake a minimum of 2000 avax. there is no limit to the number of validators like other consensus methods then this can cater for tens of thousands even potentially millions of validators. as every validator validates the primary network, this can be a source of trust for interoperability between subnets as well as connecting to other ecosystems, thus increasing amount of transaction fees of avax. there is no slashing in avalanche, so there is no risk to lose your avax when selecting a validator, instead rewards earnt for staking can be slashed should the validator misbehave. because avalanche doesnt have direct slashing, it is technically possible for someone to both stake and deliver tokens for something like a flash loan, under the invariant that all tokens that are staked are returned, thus being able to make profit with staked tokens outside of staking itself.there will also be a separate subnet for athereum which is a spoon, or friendly fork, of ethereum, which benefits from the avalanche consensus protocol and applications in the ethereum ecosystem. its native token ath will be airdropped to eth holders as well as potentially avax holders as well. this can be done for other blockchains as well.transaction fees on the primary network for all 3 of the blockchains as well as subscription fees for creating a subnet and blockchain are paid in avax and are burnt, creating deflationary pressure. avax is a fixed capped supply of 720 million tokens, creating scarcity rather than an unlimited supply which continuously increase of tokens at a compounded rate each year like others. initially there will be 360 tokens minted at mainnet with vesting periods between 1 and 10 years, with tokens gradually unlocking each quarter. the circulating supply is 24.5 million avax with tokens gradually released each quater. the current market cap of avax is around $100 million.## resultsavalanches avax with its fixed capped supply, deflationary pressure, very strong utility, potential to receive air drops and low market cap, means it scores . polkadots dot also has very strong utility with the need for auctions to acquire parachain slots, but has no deflationary mechanisms, no fixed capped supply and already valued at $3.8 billion, therefore scores . cosmoss atom token is only for the cosmos hub, of which there will be many hubs in the ecosystem and has very little utility currently. (this may improve once ibc is released and if cosmos hub actually becomes the hub that people want to connect to and not something like binance instead. there is no fixed capped supply and currently valued at $1.1 billion, so scores .https://preview.redd.it/zb72eto5ehq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ee102a2881d763296ad9ffba20667f531d2fd7aall three are excellent projects and have similarities as well as many differences. just to reiterate this article is not intended to be an extensive in-depth list, but rather an overview based on some of the criteria that **i** feel are most important. for a more in-depth view i recommend reading the articles for each of the projects linked above and coming to your own conclusions, you may have different criteria which is important to you, and score them differently. there wont be one platform to rule them all however, with some uses cases better suited to one platform over another, and its not a zero-sum game. blockchain is going to completely revolutionize industries and the internet itself. the more projects researching and delivering breakthrough technology the better, each learning from each other and pushing each other to reach that goal earlier. the current market is a tiny speck of whats in store in terms of value and adoption and its going to be exciting to watch it unfold.https://preview.redd.it/fwi3clz7ehq51.png?width=1388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c91c1645a4c67defd5fc3aaec84f4a765e1c50b6 historical bitcoin prices for today, october 12020 - $108212019 - $80512018 - $65872017 - $42902016 - $6072015 - $2362014 - $3882013 - $1252012 - $122011 - $52010 - $0.06what will october 1, 2021 look like? [removed] [removed] [removed] since starting in crypto almost three years ago i have lost thousands in savings. this happened by both investing in shitcoins, but more upsettingly due to me discovering crypto gambling sites such as ether crash and sports betting sites. the losses i have made both gambling and in failed investments (which is really just another form of gambling) have caused me great stress during past years, but i am thankful to say this is no longer a problem for me.yesterday i sold some of my moons and picked up just over $100usd. in comparison to my losses, this is almost nothing, but thanks to this community and the fact that i have been somewhat active over the past three years, i was able to cash out a little bit of money which will help me significantly.i just want to remind you guys to keep a bit of perspective on the bigger picture, not just the cryptocurrency world. take your profits, and most importantly if anyone can learn from me, please dont gamble.all the best, and thank you to all of you! can anyone recommend a good platform for someone who'd like to trade crypto currency and doesn't have a clou as to how it's done?i'm looking for something that's safe, reliable and lets me trade in a variety of currencires.i don't mind paying some sort of transactional fee to trade on a platform that does part of my thinking for me with regards to safety. i don't know for a fact that i will *never* lose my password so it would be nice to have the same option that i do with my broker where they will help me access my account if i'm having difficulties with it. however, i don't know if that's possible with crypto.i hope my post doesn't break any rules regarding the type of questions you can ask here. if it does, please remove it, mods. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] first off, let me clarify what i mean by the title of this thread...**i understand the need to protect one's privacy from the government in many regards.**  however, i strongly feel as though the downsides to full blown financial privacy outweigh the upsides. i know 3 millionaires (assuming they haven't fooled me in to thinking they are bat-shit rich when they aren't) off the top of my head. one drives a scooter and from time to time, he has a car with a chauffeur that drives him around town when he needs to drive over an hour, and he dresses like any other guy would and lays a low profile. he has an average-looking wife. the other drives some kind of porsche sports car but dresses modestly and has an above average wife. as for millionaire number 3, i have yet to see his car, but he dresses somewhat extravagantly (he owns a crypto exchange), and dates a hot chick right now.in all three cases, should we not have some kind of open public ledger that any law enforcement party can investigate and say, "this guy isn't involved with money laundering, smuggling drugs, or any other kind of organized crime?"there's a reason why terrorist organizations aren't using bitcoin or ethereum. i like it better that way. my first thought was *what did it take so loong?* with the large and ever-growing user base of r/cryptocurrency seemed kind of an obvious move for some time. but when you think about it, the timing is also well-thought-out - we are only at the meagre foreplay of the inevitable bull market. so this place, just like the rest of the crypto forums, will explode in terms of users, comments and the amount of content.this next cycle being about versatility, consolidation and interoperability, moons has a good shot at becoming a fuel of one of the largest ecosystems (don't see why it couldn't be accepted in other subs and beyond the reddit during the months to come).then you have not the most cozy atmosphere of this sub (to say the least) during the last few years. (what a surprise during the worst bear market in crypto history + plus all of this real-world shit storm lately). makes sense - you'll be less inclined to trash others, incite tribalism or even shill your shit - only if you wanna make some money :)ofc there are also loads of issues, like regulation or this place becoming a karma farm. but it's likely to get taken care of organically on the trial-and-error-approach. my two satoshis.**tldr:****-** thanks to the large user base and even larger potential, moons has a good shot at becoming a fuel of one of the largest ecosystems**-** perfect timing - at the inception of the more than likely bull-market**-** alongside the bull, should improve the atmosphere and quality of the posts substantially**-** still lots of questions, but it's only the start and we get to be here right from it just saw in my vault that this was now an option, though the functionality doesn't seem to work yet (when you click on convert it shows you your coin balance but doesn't actually let you do anything with it.) anyone else have success with this yet? i have a really hard time understanding why anyone would take a defi loan. if i have cryptocurrencies why not just sell them instead of using it as collatteral for a loan where i will1: pay interest2: only get maybe 75% of the worth3: the risk that is inherently in the systemi don't understand why anyone would get a defi loan considering these three points, but i am sure i must be missing something. i have tried searching for an answer but all i get is explanations on how to get a loan, not why i should (or shouldn't) get a loan. can someone provide me with an eli5 on why defi is the bee's knee. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] since the moons integration, the mods releasing a list of users with their reddit vault address.from that address users are transferring moons to different wallets.since ethereum wallets have a static address, they are easily traceable and **making a connection between a reddit username and his funds just got a lot easier.** [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] hello, i wish to buy crypto as a back up in lieu of the present state of affairs in my country (you know which one).but when i went to buy bitcoin it asked me for a picture of my id. i am not ok with that.  can someone please point me to a crypto that is truly anonymous?i do not want anyone to be able to say that i have x amount of moneys. or that i own x wallet w this or that service. cash is king, but cash can loose value overnight in a state of national emergency. i want to be able to have the freedom of cash with the security of crypto. no id proof required.any info would be very much appreciated it.

his tweet is gone and the site is gone. it really looked legitimate and people were commenting saying thank you. if this was him being hacked i feel like an idiot because i pretty much sent all of my bitcoin. this is the best bitcoin investment company  it life changing ,i am happy to join bitrollpay .com . i finally paid all my debts.https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-google-coop&amp;q=bitrollpay i don't need a full depth. perhaps just highest bid price and lowest ask price are enough. i am looking for at shortest 1 minute frequency data feed, and looking for about a year length (or more ideally).i've found a way to use bitmex and binance api to obtain the historical trade prices but they don't contain any bid and ask information. so, i have an idea for a film. it's a comedy. it's called no taxation without representation. in this film, there are a couple of buddies who are trading crypto, making exchanges and just living their lives. until taxes.so, we have our young entrepeneur played by jonah hill, and he gets in the crosshairs of a crooked irs agent, who is working in cahoots with a criminal tax filing attourney from hr block to overcharge people for their crypto transactions.jonah hasn't kept good records. the irs agent knows this, and does an audit on purpose. and then jonah's crypto wallet comes out. jonah talks to his tax accountant, and meets with the irs agent, and his life is going downhill. until... jonah's phone gets lost, and he ends up driving to the office of his tax accountant, and finds the irs guy and his tax accountant talking without him after he had paid. and they are saying some pretty incriminating things. the irs guy, is splitting the overcharged tax profits 50/50 with the tax accountant. now, jonah paid what he made fair and square. but the catch, is that the irs agent and tax attorney are putting together a scheme to make it seem like his crypto is worth more than it really was.now, the crazy part starts, and jonah enlists the help of some of his more shady friends from the monero community to help him investigate the crooked accountant. well, they break in, and find that there was way more fraud in the irs than they expected, and that the irs was cooking the books. then, the irs catches on, and enlist the fbi and our poor guys are chased by the fbi trying to silence them before they can get their story to the news.in the end, the irs wins, and poor jonah is left dead. so i guess its a tragedy and a comedy. anyone wanna flesh this story out into a full movie script to pitch to some hollywood directors? i want to make the laws that make people report each crypto transaction, and not just report the dollar value at the start and end of the year look like it is a shady government scheme designed to defraud hardworking americans who are just trying to save their money from inflation. i want to make the irs look like a criminal organization, that supports a war machine that murders millions of people every decade. i want to start a conversation in the mainstream that maybe we should not have taxation without representation. if the only people who are being represented are the people who pay the lobbyists, then only the people who pay lobbyists should be taxed. anyone knows a good bank to open a business account for bitcoin purposes?

overview## cosmoscosmos is a heterogeneous network of many independent parallel blockchains, each powered by classical bft consensus algorithms like tendermint. developers can easily build custom application specific blockchains, called zones, through the cosmos sdk framework. these zones connect to hubs, which are specifically designed to connect zones together.the vision of cosmos is to have thousands of zones and hubs that are interoperable through the inter-blockchain communication protocol (ibc). cosmos can also connect to other systems through peg zones, which are specifically designed zones that each are custom made to interact with another ecosystem such as ethereum and bitcoin. cosmos does not use sharding with each zone and hub being sovereign with their own validator set.for a more in-depth look at cosmos and provide more reference to points made in this article, please see my three part series  [part

polkadotpolkadot is a heterogeneous blockchain protocol that connects multiple specialised blockchains into one unified network. it achieves scalability through a sharding infrastructure with multiple blockchains running in parallel, called parachains, that connect to a central chain called the relay chain. developers can easily build custom application specific parachains through the substrate development framework.the relay chain validates the state transition of connected parachains, providing shared state across the entire ecosystem. if the relay chain must revert for any reason, then all of the parachains would also revert. this is to ensure that the validity of the entire system can persist, and no individual part is corruptible. the shared state makes it so that the trust assumptions when using parachains are only those of the relay chain validator set, and no other. interoperability is enabled between parachains through cross-chain message passing (xcmp) protocol and is also possible to connect to other systems through bridges, which are specifically designed parachains or parathreads that each are custom made to interact with another ecosystem such as ethereum and bitcoin. the hope is to have 100 parachains connect to the relay chain.for a more in-depth look at polkadot and provide more reference to points made in this article, please see my three part

avalancheavalanche is a platform of platforms, ultimately consisting of thousands of subnets to form a heterogeneous interoperable network of many blockchains, that takes advantage of the revolutionary avalanche consensus protocols to provide a secure, globally distributed, interoperable and trustless framework offering unprecedented decentralisation whilst being able to comply with regulatory requirements.avalanche allows anyone to create their own tailor-made application specific blockchains, supporting multiple custom virtual machines such as evm and wasm and written in popular languages like go (with others coming in the future) rather than lightly used, poorly-understood languages like solidity. this virtual machine can then be deployed on a custom blockchain network, called a subnet, which consist of a dynamic set of validators working together to achieve consensus on the state of a set of many blockchains where complex rulesets can be configured to meet regulatory compliance.avalanche was built with serving financial markets in mind. it has native support for easily creating and trading digital smart assets with complex custom rule sets that define how the asset is handled and traded to ensure regulatory compliance can be met. interoperability is enabled between blockchains within a subnet as well as between subnets. like cosmos and polkadot, avalanche is also able to connect to other systems through bridges, through custom virtual machines made to interact with another ecosystem such as ethereum and bitcoin.for a more in-depth look at avalanche and provide more reference to points made in this article, please see

between cosmos, polkadot and avalanchea frequent question i see being asked is how cosmos, polkadot and avalanche compare? whilst there are similarities there are also a lot of differences. this article is not intended to be an extensive in-depth list, but rather an overview based on some of the criteria **that i feel are most important**. for a more in-depth view **i recommend reading the articles for each of the projects linked above and coming to your own conclusions**. i want to stress that its not a case of one platform being the killer of all other platforms, far from it. there wont be one platform to rule them all, and too often the tribalism has plagued this space. blockchains are going to completely revolutionise most industries and have a profound effect on the world we know today. its still very early in this space with most adoption limited to speculation and trading mainly due to the limitations of blockchain and current iteration of ethereum, which all three of these platforms hope to address. **for those who just want a quick summary see the image at the bottom of the article**. with that said lets have a look# scalability## cosmoseach zone and hub in cosmos is capable of up to around 1000 transactions per second with bandwidth being the bottleneck in consensus. cosmos aims to have thousands of zones and hubs all connected through ibc. there is no limit on the number of zones / hubs that can be created## polkadotparachains in polkadot are also capable of up to around 1500 transactions per second. a portion of the parachain slots on the relay chain will be designated as part of the parathread pool, the performance of a parachain is split between many parathreads offering lower performance and compete amongst themselves in a per-block auction to have their transactions included in the next relay chain block. the number of parachains is limited by the number of validators on the relay chain, they hope to be able to achieve 100 parachains.## avalancheavalanche is capable of around 4500 transactions per second per subnet, this is based on modest hardware requirements to ensure maximum decentralisation of just 2 cpu cores and 4 gb of memory and with a validator size of over 2,000 nodes. performance is cpu-bound and if higher performance is required then more specialised subnets can be created with higher minimum requirements to be able to achieve 10,000 tps+ in a subnet. avalanche aims to have thousands of subnets (each with multiple virtual machines / blockchains) all interoperable with each other. there is no limit on the number of subnets that can be created.## resultsall three platforms offer vastly superior performance to the likes of bitcoin and ethereum 1.0. avalanche with its higher transactions per second, no limit on the number of subnets / blockchains that can be created and the consensus can scale to potentially millions of validators all participating in consensus scores . polkadot claims to offer more tps than cosmos, but is limited to the number of parachains (around 100) whereas with cosmos there is no limit on the number of hubs / zones that can be created. cosmos is limited to a fairly small validator size of around 200 before performance degrades whereas polkadot hopes to be able to reach 1000 validators in the relay chain (albeit only a small number of validators are assigned to each parachain). thus cosmos and polkadot scoreshttps://preview.redd.it/2o0brllyvpq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f62bb696ecaafcf6184da005d5fe0129d504518# decentralisation## cosmostendermint consensus is limited to around 200 validators before performance starts to degrade. whilst there is the cosmos hub it is one of many hubs in the network and there is no central hub or limit on the number of zones / hubs that can be created.## polkadotpolkadot has 1000 validators in the relay chain and these are split up into a small number that validate each parachain (minimum of 14). the relay chain is a central point of failure as all parachains connect to it and the number of parachains is limited depending on the number of validators (they hope to achieve 100 parachains). due to the limited number of parachain slots available, significant sums of dot will need to be purchased to win an auction to lease the slot for up to 24 months at a time. thus likely to lead to only those with enough funds to secure a parachain slot. parathreads are however an alternative for those that require less and more varied performance for those that cant secure a parachain slot.## avalancheavalanche consensus scan scale to tens of thousands of validators, even potentially millions of validators all participating in consensus through repeated sub-sampling. the more validators, the faster the network becomes as the load is split between them. there are modest hardware requirements so anyone can run a node and there is no limit on the number of subnets / virtual machines that can be created.## resultsavalanche offers unparalleled decentralisation using its revolutionary consensus protocols that can scale to millions of validators all participating in consensus at the same time. there is no limit to the number of subnets and virtual machines that can be created, and they can be created by anyone for a small fee, it scores . cosmos is limited to 200 validators but no limit on the number of zones / hubs that can be created, which anyone can create and scores . polkadot hopes to accommodate 1000 validators in the relay chain (albeit these are split amongst each of the parachains). the number of parachains is limited and maybe cost prohibitive for many and the relay chain is a ultimately a single point of failure. whilst definitely not saying its centralised and it is more decentralised than many others, just in comparison between the three, it scoreshttps://preview.redd.it/ckfamee0wpq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4355f145d821fabf7785e238dbc96a5f5ce2846# latency## cosmostendermint consensus used in cosmos reaches finality within 6 seconds. cosmos consists of many zones and hubs that connect to each other. communication between 2 zones could pass through many hubs along the way, thus also can contribute to latency times depending on the path taken as explained in [part two](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/cosmos-an-early-in-depth-analysis-at-the-ecosystem-of-connected-blockchains-part-two-2d5a9886166) of the articles on cosmos. it doesnt need to wait for an extended period of time with risk of rollbacks.## polkadotpolkadot provides a hybrid consensus protocol consisting of block producing protocol, babe, and then a finality gadget called grandpa that works to agree on a chain, out of many possible forks, by following some simpler fork choice rule. rather than voting on every block, instead it reaches agreements on chains. as soon as more than 2/3 of validators attest to a chain containing a certain block, all blocks leading up to that one are finalized at once.if an invalid block is detected after it has been finalised then the relay chain would need to be reverted along with every parachain. this is particularly important when connecting to external blockchains as those dont share the state of the relay chain and thus cant be rolled back. the longer the time period, the more secure the network is, as there is more time for additional checks to be performed and reported but at the expense of finality. finality is reached within 60 seconds between parachains but for external ecosystems like ethereum their state obviously cant be rolled back like a parachain and so finality will need to be much longer (60 minutes was suggested in the whitepaper) and discussed in more detail in [part three](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/polkadot-an-early-in-depth-analysis-part-three-limitations-and-issues-d8b0a795a3e)## avalancheavalanche consensus achieves finality within 3 seconds, with most happening sub 1 second, immutable and completely irreversible. any subnet can connect directly to another without having to go through multiple hops and any vm can talk to another vm within the same subnet as well as external subnets. it doesnt need to wait for an extended period of time with risk of rollbacks.## resultswith regards to performance far too much emphasis is just put on tps as a metric, the other equally important metric, if not more important with regards to finance is latency. throughput measures the amount of data at any given time that it can handle whereas latency is the amount of time it takes to perform an action. its pointless saying you can process more transactions per second than visa when it takes 60 seconds for a transaction to complete. low latency also greatly increases general usability and customer satisfaction, nowadays everyone expects card payments, online payments to happen instantly. avalanche achieves the best results scoring , cosmos with comes in second with 6 second finality  and polkadot with 60 second finality (which may be 60 minutes for external blockchains) scoreshttps://preview.redd.it/kzup5x42wpq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=320eb4c25dc4fc0f443a7a2f7ff09567871648cd# shared security## cosmosevery zone and hub in cosmos has their own validator set and different trust assumptions. cosmos are researching a shared security model where a hub can validate the state of connected zones for a fee but not released yet. once available this will make shared security optional rather than mandatory.## polkadotshared security is mandatory with polkadot which uses a shared state infrastructure between the relay chain and all of the connected parachains. if the relay chain must revert for any reason, then all of the parachains would also revert. every parachain makes the same trust assumptions, and as such the relay chain validates state transition and enables seamless interoperability between them. in return for this benefit, they have to purchase dot and win an auction for one of the available parachain slots.however, parachains cant just rely on the relay chain for their security, they will also need to implement censorship resistance measures and utilise proof of work / proof of stake for each parachain as well as discussed in [part three](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/polkadot-an-early-in-depth-analysis-part-three-limitations-and-issues-d8b0a795a3e), thus parachains cant just rely on the security of the relay chain, they need to ensure sybil resistance mechanisms using pow and pos are implemented on the parachain as well.## avalanchea subnet in avalanche consists of a dynamic set of validators working together to achieve consensus on the state of a set of **many** blockchains where complex rulesets can be configured to meet regulatory compliance. so unlike in cosmos where each zone / hub has their own validators, a subnet can validate a single or many virtual machines / blockchains with a single validator set. shared security is optional## resultsshared security is mandatory in polkadot and a key design decision in its infrastructure. the relay chain validates the state transition of all connected parachains and thus scores . subnets in avalanche can validate state of either a single or many virtual machines. each subnet can have their own token and shares a validator set, where complex rulesets can be configured to meet regulatory compliance. it scores  . every zone and hub in cosmos has their own validator set / token but research is underway to have the hub validate the state transition of connected zones, but as this is still early in the research phase scores  for now.https://preview.redd.it/pbgyk3o3wpq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61c18e12932a250f5633c40633810d0f64520575# current adoption## cosmosthe cosmos project started in 2016 with an ico held in april 2017. there are currently around 50 projects building on the cosmos sdk with a full list can be seen [here](https://cosmonauts.world/) and filtering for cosmos sdk . not all of the projects will necessarily connect using native cosmos sdk and ibc and some have forked parts of the cosmos sdk and utilise the tendermint consensus such as binance chain but have said they will connect in the future.## polkadotthe polkadot project started in 2016 with an ico held in october 2017. there are currently around 70 projects building on substrate and a full list can be seen here and filtering for substrate based. like with cosmos not all projects built using substrate will necessarily connect to polkadot and parachains or parathreads arent currently implemented in either the live or test network (kusama) as of the time of this writing.## avalancheavalanche in comparison started much later with ava labs being founded in 2018. avalanche held its ico in july 2020. due to lot shorter time it has been in development, the number of projects confirmed are smaller with around 14 projects currently building on avalanche. due to the customisability of the platform though, many virtual machines can be used within a subnet making the process incredibly easy to port projects over. as an example, it will launch with the ethereum virtual machine which enables byte for byte compatibility and all the tooling like metamask, truffle etc. will work, so projects can easily move over to benefit from the performance, decentralisation and low gas fees offered. in the future cosmos and substrate virtual machines could be implemented on avalanche.## resultswhilst its still early for all 3 projects (and the entire blockchain space as a whole), there is currently more projects confirmed to be building on cosmos and polkadot, mostly due to their longer time in development. whilst cosmos has fewer projects, zones are implemented compared to polkadot which doesnt currently have parachains. ibc to connect zones and hubs together is due to launch q2 2021, thus both score . avalanche has been in development for a lot shorter time period, but is launching with an impressive feature set right from the start with ability to create subnets, vms, assets, nfts, permissioned and permissionless blockchains, cross chain atomic swaps within a subnet, smart contracts, bridge to ethereum etc. applications can easily port over from other platforms and use all the existing tooling such as metamask / truffle etc but benefit from the performance, decentralisation and low gas fees offered. currently though just based on the number of projects in comparison it scores .https://preview.redd.it/4zpi6s85wpq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e91ade1a86a5d50f4976f3b23a46e9287b08e373# enterprise adoption## cosmoscosmos enables permissioned and permissionless zones which can connect to each other with the ability to have full control over who validates the blockchain. for permissionless zones each zone / hub can have their own token and they are in control who validates.## polkadotwith polkadot the state transition is performed by a small randomly selected assigned group of validators from the relay chain plus with the possibility that state is rolled back if an invalid transaction of any of the other parachains is found. this may pose a problem for enterprises that need complete control over who performs validation for regulatory reasons. in addition due to the limited number of parachain slots available enterprises would have to acquire and lock up large amounts of a highly volatile asset (dot) and have the possibility that they are outbid in future auctions and find they no longer can have their parachain validated and parathreads dont provide the guaranteed performance requirements for the application to function.## avalancheavalanche enables permissioned and permissionless subnets and complex rulesets can be configured to meet regulatory compliance. for example a subnet can be created where its mandatory that all validators are from a certain legal jurisdiction, or they hold a specific license and regulated by the sec etc. subnets are also able to scale to tens of thousands of validators, and even potentially millions of nodes, all participating in consensus so every enterprise can run their own node rather than only a small amount. enterprises dont have to hold large amounts of a highly volatile asset, but instead pay a fee in avax for the creation of the subnets and blockchains which is burnt.## resultsavalanche provides the customisability to run private permissioned blockchains as well as permissionless where the enterprise is in control over who validates the blockchain, with the ability to use complex rulesets to meet regulatory compliance, thus scores . cosmos is also able to run permissioned and permissionless zones / hubs so enterprises have full control over who validates a blockchain and scores . polkadot requires locking up large amounts of a highly volatile asset with the possibility of being outbid by competitors and being unable to run the application if the guaranteed performance is required and having to migrate away. the relay chain validates the state transition and can roll back the parachain should an invalid block be detected on another parachain, thus scores .https://preview.redd.it/li5jy6u6wpq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2a95f1f88e5efbcf9e23c789ae0f002c8eb73fc# interoperability## cosmoscosmos will connect hubs and zones together through its ibc protocol (due to release in q1 2020). connecting to blockchains outside of the cosmos ecosystem would either require the connected blockchain to fork their code to implement ibc or more likely a custom peg zone will be created specific to work with a particular blockchain its trying to bridge to such as ethereum etc. each zone and hub has different trust levels and connectivity between 2 zones can have different trust depending on which path it takes (this is discussed more in [this article](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/cosmos-an-early-in-depth-analysis-at-the-ecosystem-of-connected-blockchains-part-two-2d5a9886166)). finality time is low at 6 seconds, but depending on the number of hops, this can increase significantly.## polkadotpolkadots shared state means each parachain that connects shares the same trust assumptions, of the relay chain validators and that if one blockchain needs to be reverted, all of them will need to be reverted. interoperability is enabled between parachains through cross-chain message passing (xcmp) protocol and is also possible to connect to other systems through bridges, which are specifically designed parachains or parathreads that each are custom made to interact with another ecosystem such as ethereum and bitcoin. finality time between parachains is around 60 seconds, but longer will be needed (initial figures of 60 minutes in the whitepaper) for connecting to external blockchains. thus limiting the appeal of connecting two external ecosystems together through polkadot. polkadot is also limited in the number of parachain slots available, thus limiting the amount of blockchains that can be bridged. parathreads could be used for lower performance bridges, but the speed of future blockchains is only going to increase.## avalanchea subnet can validate multiple virtual machines / blockchains and all blockchains within a subnet share the same trust assumptions / validator set, enabling cross chain interoperability. interoperability is also possible between any other subnet, with the hope avalanche will consist of thousands of subnets. each subnet may have a different trust level, but as the primary network consists of all validators then this can be used as a source of trust if required. as avalanche supports many virtual machines, bridges to other ecosystems are created by running the connected virtual machine. there will be an ethereum bridge using the evm shortly after mainnet. finality time is much faster at sub 3 seconds (with most happening under 1 second) with no chance of rolling back so more appealing when connecting to external blockchains.## resultsall 3 systems are able to perform interoperability within their ecosystem and transfer assets as well as data, as well as use bridges to connect to external blockchains. cosmos has different trust levels between its zones and hubs and can create issues depending on which path it takes and additional latency added. polkadot provides the same trust assumptions for all connected parachains but has long finality and limited number of parachain slots available. avalanche provides the same trust assumptions for all blockchains within a subnet, and different trust levels between subnets. however due to the primary network consisting of all validators it can be used for trust. avalanche also has a much faster finality time with no limitation on the number of blockchains / subnets / bridges that can be created. overall all three blockchains excel with interoperability within their ecosystem and each score .https://preview.redd.it/ai0bkbq8wpq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e85ee6a3c4670f388ccea00b0c906c3fb51e415# tokenomics## cosmosthe atom token is the native token for the cosmos hub. it is commonly mistaken by people that think its the token used throughout the cosmos ecosystem, whereas its just used for one of many hubs in cosmos, each with their own token. currently atom has little utility as ibc isnt released and has no connections to other zones / hubs. once ibc is released zones may prefer to connect to a different hub instead and so atom is not used. atom isnt a fixed capped supply token and supply will continuously increase with a yearly inflation of around 10% depending on the % staked. the current market cap for atom as of the time of this writing is $1 billion with 203 million circulating supply. rewards can be earnt through staking to offset the dilution caused by inflation. delegators can also get slashed and lose a portion of their atom should the validator misbehave.## polkadotpolkadots native token is dot and its used to secure the relay chain. each parachain needs to acquire sufficient dot to win an auction on an available parachain lease period of up to 24 months at a time. parathreads have a fixed fee for registration that would realistically be much lower than the cost of acquiring a parachain slot and compete with other parathreads in a per-block auction to have their transactions included in the next relay chain block. dot isnt a fixed capped supply token and supply will continuously increase with a yearly inflation of around 10% depending on the % staked. the current market cap for dot as of the time of this writing is $4.4 billion with 852 million circulating supply. delegators can also get slashed and lose their dot (potentially 100% of their dot for serious attacks) should the validator misbehave.## avalancheavax is the native token for the primary network in avalanche. every validator of any subnet also has to validate the primary network and stake a minimum of 2000 avax. there is no limit to the number of validators like other consensus methods then this can cater for tens of thousands even potentially millions of validators. as every validator validates the primary network, this can be a source of trust for interoperability between subnets as well as connecting to other ecosystems, thus increasing amount of transaction fees of avax. there is no slashing in avalanche, so there is no risk to lose your avax when selecting a validator, instead rewards earnt for staking can be slashed should the validator misbehave. because avalanche doesnt have direct slashing, it is technically possible for someone to both stake and deliver tokens for something like a flash loan, under the invariant that all tokens that are staked are returned, thus being able to make profit with staked tokens outside of staking itself.there will also be a separate subnet for athereum which is a spoon, or friendly fork, of ethereum, which benefits from the avalanche consensus protocol and applications in the ethereum ecosystem. its native token ath will be airdropped to eth holders as well as potentially avax holders as well. this can be done for other blockchains as well.transaction fees on the primary network for all 3 of the blockchains as well as subscription fees for creating a subnet and blockchain are paid in avax and are burnt, creating deflationary pressure. avax is a fixed capped supply of 720 million tokens, creating scarcity rather than an unlimited supply which continuously increase of tokens at a compounded rate each year like others. initially there will be 360 tokens minted at mainnet with vesting periods between 1 and 10 years, with tokens gradually unlocking each quarter. the circulating supply is 24.5 million avax with tokens gradually released each quater. the current market cap of avax is around $100 million.## resultsavalanches avax with its fixed capped supply, deflationary pressure, very strong utility, potential to receive air drops and low market cap, means it scores . polkadots dot also has very strong utility with the need for auctions to acquire parachain slots, but has no deflationary mechanisms, no fixed capped supply and already valued at $3.8 billion, therefore scores . cosmoss atom token is only for the cosmos hub, of which there will be many hubs in the ecosystem and has very little utility currently. (this may improve once ibc is released and if cosmos hub actually becomes the hub that people want to connect to and not something like binance instead. there is no fixed capped supply and currently valued at $1.1 billion, so scores .https://preview.redd.it/mels7myawpq51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df9782e2c0a4c26b61e462746256bdf83b1fb906all three are excellent projects and have similarities as well as many differences. just to reiterate this article is not intended to be an extensive in-depth list, but rather an overview based on some of the criteria that **i** feel are most important. for a more in-depth view i recommend reading the articles for each of the projects linked above and coming to your own conclusions, you may have different criteria which is important to you, and score them differently. there wont be one platform to rule them all however, with some uses cases better suited to one platform over another, and its not a zero-sum game. blockchain is going to completely revolutionize industries and the internet itself. the more projects researching and delivering breakthrough technology the better, each learning from each other and pushing each other to reach that goal earlier. the current market is a tiny speck of whats in store in terms of value and adoption and its going to be exciting to watch it unfold.https://preview.redd.it/dbb99egcwpq51.png?width=1388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeb03127dc0dc74d0507328e899db1c7d7fc2879for more information see the articles below (each with additional sources at the bottom of their articles)[avalanche, a revolutionary consensus engine and platform. a game changer for blockchain](https://medium.com/ava-hub/avalanche-a-revolutionary-consensus-engine-and-platform-a-game-changer-for-blockchain-fdac008edc35)[avalanche consensus, the biggest breakthrough since nakamoto](https://medium.com/ava-hub/avalanche-consensus-the-biggest-breakthrough-since-nakamoto-66e9917fd656)[cosmos  an early in-depth analysis  part one](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/cosmos-an-early-in-depth-analysis-at-the-ecosystem-of-connected-blockchains-part-one-508cd679bac5)[cosmos  an early in-depth analysis  part two](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/cosmos-an-early-in-depth-analysis-at-the-ecosystem-of-connected-blockchains-part-two-2d5a9886166)[cosmos hub atom token and the commonly misunderstood staking tokens  part three](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/cosmos-atom-token-and-the-commonly-misunderstood-staking-tokens-part-three-958c295c5b78)[polkadot  an early in-depth analysis  part one  overview and benefits](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/polkadot-an-early-in-depth-analysis-part-one-overview-and-benefits-ea16de17c05c)[polkadot  an early in-depth analysis  part two  how consensus works](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/polkadot-an-early-in-depth-analysis-part-two-how-consensus-works-1b2b2f3a2245)[polkadot  an early in-depth analysis  part three  limitations and issues](https://medium.com/@cryptoseq/polkadot-an-early-in-depth-analysis-part-three-limitations-and-issues-d8b0a795a3e) [removed] i'm guessing btc and eth are way out in front by a long way. but out of all the other projects, what is the best indicator of an active healthy project?most trading data can be manipulated. and github commits don't necessarily translate to adoption.so what other metrics can you use to compare projects? hello everyone,i bought bitcoin when it was at 15k and today, just hodling, i'm actually in the green, you may think this is weird but the thing is, here in brazil our economy has gone really really bad when i bought it brl to usd was 3.2 now it is at 5.6 so even though bitcoin is pretty volatile it is still more stable then brazilian real.so yeah bitcoin is a good investment if you live in a country with bad economy [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] today [apy.finance](https://apy.finance) opened their liquidity mining program. within 1 hour of the launch, the platform witnessed total of $67 million added to their smart contracts.**why such high interest:**since the closure of [apy.finance](https://apy.finance) private sale round, the team worked out on a plan to cheer-up community sentiment and designed liquidity mining in order to have the fair distribution of apy governance tokens in the hands of the community members, thereby truly decentralizing the power over platform economics decision.i believe such high interest may be due to some yield farmers forgetting that they are participating in distribution of governance token. users who are adding funds to [apy.finance](https://apy.finance) platform are not participating in yield farming any defi strategy but mining apy governance tokens. this was already mentioned in the earlier blog post ( [1](https://medium.com/apy-finance/introducing-the-apy-token-edac64d0cf6b?source=collection_home---6------1-----------------------) and [2](https://medium.com/apy-finance/apy-finance-liquidity-mining-launch-c37f0d2a1172)) by the team. the first month will see 900,000 apy tokens mined, the official blog post outlined, that incentive details will vary month-to-month. the total amount of apy to be mined will be total 31.2 million tokens, or 31.2% of total supply.as of this writing, i already see total of 350+ addresses already interacted with the apy liquidity mining smart contract address. this is just one day and that already represent the companies vision of making governance token truly decentralized and owned by the community.&amp;#x200b;**closing remarks:**in my believe the team also did not expected such high interest level and may now have to get back to the drawing board to review the reward scheme. something similar to snx staking wherein rewards are generated through the inflationary monetary policy. usually stakes in synthetix are escrow for a year and the snx staking rewards enabled by the inflationary supply are set to decrease gradually until 2023.currently the governance tokens minted from [apy.finance](https://apy.finance)'s liquidity mining program are escrow for 6 months and available only for one month and set to gradually decrease in this period.

[removed] you are welcome, guys. 2 years ago i bought 4 times 0.1 btc and put them in a new wallet. i exported the private key and saved it in an encrypted password container together with my other keys. coming back to it a few months ago, i wanted to transfer these 0.4 btc to my main wallet to get a better overview about the satoshis and have them all in one place and for lending them out. turns out i made a mistake while doing copy&amp;paste and so i saved the wrong private key. next time i will check twice if the private key is correct and this will not happen again to me. watch out and feel a little more wealth coming to you as i decreased the total supply of btc for everyone and made you a bit richer.tl;dr: i lost 0.4 btc because i made a mistake doing copy and paste and therefore btc got a little more value for everyone. hey coinbase,my uk customers (i can't speak for any other country) have received emails informing them that the hmrc have requested details on anyone who has cashed out or help more than 5000 pounds in crypto assets.my request is that, like every other institution, you provide an exact downloadable report for the user also of the information sent to hmrc for our own records. a statement if you will.i also think this is an important step going forward as crypto is still rather new and constantly changing, as are the laws and requirements and some people might struggle to provide what is needed correctly. this may greatly help reduce the risk of committing accidental crime.what do you all think? ideas, suggestions?? lets get this noticed by coinbase and try to get an official response.

[removed] i don't know anything about crypto currency or trading, so i am asking you. i won 0.7 btc in a contest and i was given a code by the ryebit staff on discord. the code worked but how do i know this isn't a scam or something like that? i can't find anything about them on the internet. is it safe to go on and withdraw the bitcoin? they request a person identification whit my national id card and other personal informations.i'll leave the url: [https://ryebit.com/en](https://ryebit.com/en) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] let's say bitcoin finally breaks it's all time high and the excitement is too much for me and i suffer a heart attack. what is the best way for me to ensure that my family can access my crypto?&amp;nbsp;currently i have 2 nano ledgers which i keep updated to the latest firmware. i've told a family member the pin code for these ledgers (i chose a pin code that is something that they'd be able to remember and every now and then i'll say 'what's my pin code?' to make sure they've still got it).&amp;nbsp;now, they don't know a thing about cryptocurrency, and while i could teach them how to use the ledger and send to an exchange etc, what i've told them to do instead is to give the ledgers and the pin code to a **very well trusted** family friend who is familiar with crypto (he even used to mine bitcoin from his laptop back in the olden days). i know that may sound like a risk but i have grown up with this friend, my family knows him well, and we trust him implicitly.&amp;nbsp;my only concern is that if there were an issue with the ledgers, nobody has access to my seed phrase and the funds are gone. so what's the best way of making my seed phrase (i have a passphrase too) accessible to my loved ones in the case i should pass away?&amp;nbsp;i don't feel comfortable giving anyone the whole 24 words (not out of trust, but just in case it was exposed somehow) so what i was thinking is to give 12 words to a family member, and 12 words + passphrase to this friend of ours. that way if all the ledger devices were to fail my friend can restore the wallets, and if only 12 words got exposed, the funds would be safu.&amp;nbsp;what do you think? does this sound like a reasonable plan? i'd be happy to hear your thoughts, and any other suggestions about what you do for this scenario?&amp;nbsp;cheers! so this evening was a rough night for the markets, trump got his .5% bump, and like an hour later it comes out he has covid. and as soon as each story broke the markets took a nice flight off a cliff.what i dont get is why is crypto doing that? i would think crypto markets would be inversely proportional to wall street, which obviously is going to see some major dips with such news. but i would think uncertainty in wallstreet would lead to increased investment in crypto...with the way things work, its almost like people are pulling money out of investments and holding cash, which is idiotic as the dollar is the most vulnerable place to put your money in uncertain times. or am i totally misunderstanding something?

i like the idea of bitcoin, but the fees are so high. if i want an everyday cryptocurrency (that i can use for buying things or sending friends a few bucks), what should i do (assuming i'd still like bitcoin to be the store of my wealth)?

[removed] **part 1/4 - free market?**first off, let's set the scene.the stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.economic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.the correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the s&amp;p 500 index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.why?well, it is the centralbanks, led by the fed, who printed their way out of the recession in '08.in doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion in us history.however, this is not a particularlymeritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [cantillon effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1aeeqs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.former federal reserve chairman paul volcker told the new york times in 2018:*the central issue is were developing into a plutocracy. weve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that theyre rich because theyre smart and constructive."*the reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.now, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.*however*, the issue, particularly since the us completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.we are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.in fact, the global debt to gdp ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.inflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.deflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.that's a good thing right? you get more goods and services for less.well, no.if you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.as the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt.this is why central banks fear deflation so much.however, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...**part 2/4 - technological deflation:**the increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.[throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. this is *not* a new phenomenon.all technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create "supply side shocks", meaning that they allow for more intensiveuse of resourcesand thus higher production. with more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall.in the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.it is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: aiaccording to steve schwarzman, the co-founder and ceo of the blackstone group who has a net worth of $17.6bn:*"this is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology"*moreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech.

[removed] if someone buys a glass of soda from you, you do not need to know who he is or where he got his money from. the reason is that this person cannot hope to buy a glass of soda at a retail price and easily resell it later on at a similar price.if a product has the characteristic of easy resale, regardless of what exactly it is, you will generally not be allowed to freely trade in it.in that case, you must store a verified copy of the buyer or seller's identity and legal address. you must also thoroughly interrogate that person about the origin of his money.even if you do that, and meticulously archive the documentation, you will sooner or later still have to deal with accusations of money laundering. if you do not enjoy enough political protection, you will probably also end up incarcerated in prison for long periods of time.it does not matter what exactly the product is.the only thing that matters, is that it can easily resold. if a glass of soda had that characteristic, you would inevitably face criminal prosecution for trading in it.during the war in bosnia, a marlboro cigarette was such product.bitcoin also happens to be such product. a common argument thrown by traditional investors is that cryptocurrencies don't have an intrinsic value. the classical example is saying that bitcoin is not as good as gold because you can build stuff with gold, while bitcoin's only use is speculation, but i don't find this true at all.first of all, you can use bitcoin to pay fees to write into the most decentralized and robust database in history. that by itself has instrinsic value. and second but not less important, you can actually own bitcoin easily. a lot of investors don't actually possess gold. they posses contracts that say that they own gold somewhere with no easy way or no way at all to redeem it. so you usually couldn't due anything with the gold you own. you cannot melt it, forge it, or anything.same for stocks. they often are not under your name. heck, sometimes there are not even stocks involved at all. you only have a contract that tracks that tracks the price of them. so, a lot of people can't do anything with their stocks other than trading them through intermediaries and during trading hours/days. you usually don't receive a dividend or have a way to vote on the company's direction. unlike some cryptocurrencies that actually provide you with that and you can actually own by yourself, unlike the gold, stocks, or forex, you probably would never be able to withdrawn (only your balance in a specific asset, not in any other of the assets you allegedly possess).yesterday i tried to discuss this on investing, and i got a lot of backlash, with a lot of people missing the point, thinking that i was suggesting buying stocks based on the dividends they offer or something similar, with is far from what i'm saying. so i thought about starting the same discussion in this community to see if the argument lands better or i'm really missing something here.what do you think?

[removed] unfortunately i posted a pretty large crypto loss this year...at least i thought i did.it's hard to track coinbase, coinbase pro, uniswap, etc. transactions, but at the end of the day i assumed i was down about 2 units (trying to keep this generic as possible). but, because its so hard to track, i decided to use tokentax to pull on these transactions and give me a summary.tokentax says that i am actually up 3 units (not down 2 units). but it also says that i have an unrealized loss of ~5 units. but, alas, i have indeed sold the crypto that is "unrealized" so not sure what tokentax says unrealized.can someone please help me understand what to do here? i'm happy to provide more information. also am obviously willing to seek tax help from a professional, but i feel as though i (or tokentax) must be missing something obvious. i cant seem to get an answer to this, there telegram and forums are dead. i find it strange since there are already some big projects on their like loopring. if it can work with metamask, it could take a chunk out of ethereum with l2 wallets, faster dexes with other blockchains, inlcluding erc20, so overtime polka could complement eth or replace it.my post on polkahttps://np.reddit.com/r/polkadot/comments/j3rwi9/recently_interested_in_polkadot_i_have_questions/recently interested in polkadot. i have questions regarding how any upcoming metamask integration will work. moonbeam looks interesting but do you need to run a node?&gt; after reading crappy medium articles i got to the meat of it. this is eth 2 shipped early. arguably better, i like the governance model also which eth does not have its github discussions as one example&gt; https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-comparisons-ethereum-2 https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-bridges https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crosschain&gt; so the real kicker to any adoption is integration with metamask, avoid any gas cost from doing the first transaction on eth mainnet.&gt; i found this article on meta mask integration&gt; https://medium.com/moonbeam-network/using-metamask-to-interact-with-a-local-moonbeam-node-16679214fad2&gt; few questions&gt; do you require to run a moonbeam node to interact with the eth mainnet?&gt; if the above is true, how can this be made seemless to the user. it would need to run a node in the browser as an extension for example. but then people need to install the extension.&gt; in the tutorial ud need to be a need to know some basic programming stuff to run the node. no reg crypto person will do this&gt; im wondering what kind of metamask integration is occuring and how easy / dummy proof it will be for the user to use. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] **part 1/4 - free market?**first off, let's set the scene.the stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.economic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.the correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the s&amp;p 500 index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.why?well, it is the centralbanks, led by the fed, who printed their way out of the recession in '08.in doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion in us history.however, this is not a particularlymeritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [cantillon effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1aeeqs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.former federal reserve chairman paul volcker told the new york times in 2018:*the central issue is were developing into a plutocracy. weve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that theyre rich because theyre smart and constructive."*the reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.now, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.*however*, the issue, particularly since the us completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.we are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.in fact, the global debt to gdp ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.inflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.deflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.that's a good thing right? you get more goods and services for less.well, no.if you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.as the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt.this is why central banks fear deflation so much.however, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...**part 2/4 - technological deflation:**the increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.[throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. this is *not* a new phenomenon.all technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create "supply side shocks", meaning that they allow for more intensiveuse of resourcesand thus higher production. with more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall.in the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.it is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: aiaccording to steve schwarzman, the co-founder and ceo of the blackstone group who has a net worth of $17.6bn:*"this is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology"*moreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idukkbn21k1c7) of exactly this.old legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it.as an example, if you folded a piece of paper 51 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 51 times, it would reach the sun!**part 3/4 - implications for society:**the question is: how does this play out?in the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, notwho is president for 4 to 8 years.in reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. we have seen [what happens when a president doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91rzko5gw)...one could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:1. divide and conquer and2.

**"inflation makes you pay 50 dollars for the 20 dollar haircut you used to get for 5 dollars when you had hair!"**let's embark on a journey that made the united states the number 1 economy of the world.#### 1.  despite the british empire's claim that it would for ever remain the  leading empire,history can serve as a harbinger for what's to come...at  the peak of its power, in 1913, "the empire on which the sun never  sets", controlled 25% of the planet's land mass and about the same  percentage of the world's population. britain was both the naval an  imperial power of the 19th century, and between 1812-1914, its dominance  resulted in relative peace in europe and the rest of the world. the  industrial revolution transformed britain into the workshop of the  world.by the start of the 20th century things changed as both  germany and the united states started to challenge britain's economic  and influential leadership. as often happened during human history such  challenging lead to war and although britain achieved its largest  territorial influence after ww1, the war had destroyed much of its  economic strength, with losses in industrial and military power marking  the begin of its demise.during ww2, japan occupied britain's  colonies, and after ww2, india, britain's most valuable and populous  possession, achieved independence. much of the british empire's  influence is now enshrined in the commonwealth charter, stating shared  values like democracy, human rights and the rule of law.the  united kingdom's pound sterling was its world's reserve currency during  its reign and by controlling the supply of money, britain was able to  influence its global power.**"permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and i care not who makes its laws!"** *mayer amschel rothschild*#### 2. the us empire repeats this blueprint by claiming the u.s. dollar's reserve currency status as its birthright!**the federal reserve act.**the  panic of 1907 triggered many american's belief that the federal reserve  act, passed by the 63rd united states congress and signed into law by  president woodrow wilson on december 23, 1913, was necessary for  financial and economic stability. the law created the federal reserve  system, the central banking system of the united states.**the bretton woods system.**the  fed ended immobile reserve issues and the inelastic currency problems  and successfully internationalized the u.s dollar as the global reserve  currency. the usage of the prior nationally used u.s. dollar expanded a  first time when the allies agreed to the terms of the bretton woods  system, establishing the rules for commercial as well as financial  regulations among the united states and its allies. canada, western  europe, australia and japan accepted the u.s. dollar, which was backed  by a gold exchange standard, making the u.s. dollar "as good as gold".  this was only possible because the united states controlled two thirds  of the world's gold reserves.soviet representatives, who claimed  that institutions like the imf and the international bank for  reconstruction and development (ibrd) were wall street branches, didn't  participate in bretton woods and later proved to be right, as the united  states printed too much money (not backed by its gold reserves) to wage  war on vietnam, destroying a big part of the value of the u.s. dollars  held by its allies, due to the inflation of the u.s. dollar money  supply.yet, the initial demand for u.s. dollars created the  american way of life: a consumer driven economy fueled by products made  outside the u.s. in return for u.s. dollars. as the allied countries  couldn't really buy any "made in america"-products, due to the fact that  the united states' elites rather outsourced their manufacturing, they  instead invested their hard labor into u.s. treasuries.on august  1971, president richard nixon announced the unilateral cancellation of  the direct international convertibility of the united states dollar to  gold, in a response to halt the allied countries' continuous attempts to  exchange their u.s. dollars for gold. by 1973, the bretton woods system  was replaced by the current freely floating fiat currency system.**the petro dollar system.**the  second wave of u.s. dollar adoption was the result of the petro dollar,  making the global trade of oil u.s. dollar denominated. every country  on this planet needed and still needs oil to operate and grow its  economy, creating an enormous growth in u.s. dollar demand and like  mentioned before, those dollars had to be earned. especially china  served the united states consumer model by producing almost everything  americans can buy in wall mart and other stores. by relying on the u.s.  dollar reserve currency status, the american elites have made the  mistake of outsourcing manufacturing to china, as often predicted by  donald trump in the 1980's. the y figured it was easier to just print  wealth.**the tradewar.**president donald  trump, decided it was time to bring jobs back to the u.s. and started an  ongoing trade war with china, the country that supplied the u.s.  consumer driven economy, and proud owner of $1.07 trillion in treasury  holdings. the trade war has negatively impacted the economies of both  the united states and china and will most likely result in the  decoupling of both economies.**what is to come? my personal insights.**i  see huge problems for the u.s. and the rest of the western liberal  democracies. but especially the united states, who's currency amounts to  no less than 60% of all the world's reserve assets, is vulnerable if  and when china who only accounts for 1 or 2 %, says it is time for  change. most likely we will experience another banking crisis, with or  without covid-19, and unfortunately a bigger one when compared to the  2008 dissaster. did you know that the global debt tripled since then?  many economists and politicians advocate the end of the u.s. dollar  reserve currency system and predict a reset. every financial system has a  limited lifespan similar to a human live: it is created, it grows, it  matures, and unfortunately, it ages, weakens and dies. it happened to  the brittish pound sterling, and i am afraid that the days of this  financial hegemony are numbered as well.**and i did write "afraid", why?**history  tells us that these transition periods are particularly dangerous and  have often led to full-blown military conflicts if not world wars. the  current wealth transfer, the result of manufacturing outsourcing to  mainland china, impoverished the united states and destroyed its middle  class. president donald trump's analysis that the u.s. needs a strong  manufacturing base is correct, yet without its allies the united states  will not be able to turn the tide.it took china decades to build  its manufacturing base, and president trump doesn't have the privilege  of having the political luxury to design five year plans, as the united  states capitalistic and political model specializes more on presidential  campaigning and less on economic planning, which is exactly china's  strength.#### 3. the chinese 'digital' empire.china  is ideally positioned to become the new global power: it produces many  of our products and dominates most supply chains. it has been hoarding  gold and mines most of the bitcoin. it might just have the right reserve  assets to back its dcep, the digital yuan, which will be pilot tested  during the 2022 winter olympics hosted by china. despite the fact that  the united states and other western nations might not want to adopt the  yuan or allow it to be part of the world's reserve assets, china can  demand payment in yuan for its products. it's that simple! this is why  outsourcing is such as stupid economic voluntarily yet fatal policy. if  you only print money and don't produce goods, how long will the world  play ball?one of the results of trump's trade war is that china  and other countries such as russia and iran no longer want to be  vulnerable to u.s. sanctions that come in the shape of being denied  access to the financial system through swift. the united states can  indeed destroy a big part of iran's economy, but iran is now becoming a  big cryptocurrency player. in other words, bullying those countries  might work in the short-term, but in the long-term they will simply  adopt a new standard: and i believe that the yuan will likely play a  major role in the financial system they will adopt.this trend  means that the expansion of the demand in u.s. dollars will stop and  reverse, when countries no longer want to use the currency whose issuer  can economically destroy them through sanctions. the alternatives for  such countires are cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum and many  others, national cbdc's (central bank digital currencies), and the  adoption of the digital yuan.this digital yuan will be attached  to the one belt, one road initiative, finding adoption whilst developing  huge infrastructure projects that will lead to a eurasian trading zone.  if the u.s. military leaves the middle east, as trump brings home  troops, this will create the right conditions for china to emerge as the  victor.#### 4. surveillance capitalism - insights on the dcep (digital currency electronic payment, dc/ep):1.  this centralized digital financial system works on blockchain and  cryptographic principles and aims to increase the circulation of the  rmb, in the hope it can become a reserve currency like the u.s. dollar.2. created and sanctioned by the chinese government, it is the only legal digital currency in china.3.  the system offers chinese regulators better monitoring abilities and  will be an efficient tool against anonymous counterfeiting, money  laundering and illegal financing. at the same time it reduces costs  involved in maintaining and recycling bank notes and coins.4. as  mentioned above, china aims to bypass swift, which it regards to be a  u.s. entity, and will be able to collect real-time data related to money  creation, bookkeeping, essential information for the implementation of  monetary policies.5. the pilot institutions for dcep, china  construction bank, agricultural bank of china, bank of china and  industrial and commercial bank of china, will serve as a production test  for china's new currency system, after which the dcep will be  distributed to large fintech companies such as tencent and alibaba to be  used in wechat pay and alipay. transfers will not go through bank  accounts, but through electronic wallets.6. by mandating that  all merchants who accept digital payments must accept dcep, the decp  will become the most accepted digital currency in the world.#### 5. sings of hope.if  the united states adopts blockchain and issues a cbdc (central bank  digital currency) backed by bitcoin, they will have a reasonable chance  to offer the western democracies a new type of dollar standard that can  be an anchor versus the coming rmb. if not, i fear the worst is yet to  come for the u.s. dollar and its economy.many smart american  economists and wall street goeroe's have finally figured out the  remarkable strength of bitcoin, the world's first and most favorite  digital form of gold.some of the smartest investment capitalists  like ray dalio and warren buffet have allocated more money into gold, a  clear sign of trouble. bitcoin might be a step too far for warren  buffet, but rest assure that wall street investment management companies  have figured it out by now, have you?you can expect more  institutions to allocate a % of their portfolio's wealth into bitcoin  and other cryptocurrencies, as a hedge against the systemic risk in our  global financial system, which will inevitable start feeling the effects  of the trillions that have been printed.**"inflation makes you

looked at giving his parents a ledger but they arent techies. i also thought about opening a coinbase for him but not wanting them to keep it on an exchange for 18 years. finally looked at grayscale

in moscow russia, tehran iran, and shanghai china which is extremely interesting. looking at the name server [ns1.humanrights.foundation](https://ns1.humanrights.foundation) it is mind blowing that someone hosting human rights and bitcoin related pages in china, iran and russia.seems that western propaganda from nato, state department, pentagon and the eu in general is broken into little pieces. they the western governments always saying china, iran and russia censors "human rights activists" and yet here is this [humanrights.foundation](https://humanrights.foundation) and [bitcoin.foundation](https://bitcoin.foundation) which has not been censored at all.i also see a website [https://humanrights.legal](https://humanrights.legal) on the same nameserver which contains covenants and conventions related to human rights, basically international human rights law, each of the documents posted there are in force in many countries.i wonder what is going to happen at [bitcoin.foundation](https://bitcoin.foundation) and why it is hosted in china, russia and iran.u/memorydealers do you have any idea about this bitcoin foundation? far as i know you was a founding member the now bankrupt and dissolved washington d.c. based "the bitcoin foundation, inc" its been 3 years now since my first bitcoin purchase. ever since ive bought every month. constant stacking with smallish amounts might feel useless at the time of purchase but already after few months youll start to appreciate the stack youve managed to build. let alone 3 years. i encourage everybody who thinks they are late to just start! it doesnt matter if the amount is small, what matters is that you continue to do it every month, and never stop. i initially set a target to myself that i ll stack until im a fiat net worth millionaire. this is the current goal post yes, but only for declaring some sort of personal victory. in reality, i ll never stop stacking, never going back to fiat, never giving up my bitcoin. its been a blast the last 3 years, looking forward to the next three!http://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-5-october-2020/ uk specific post - although the essence might be relevant for other markets.i recently became aware that hmrc views cryptocurrencies as a taxable item, that mainly attracts capital gains tax. this may be commonly known on here, but i had done some prior research before starting to stack and was fairly confident in my mind that it was treated similarly to a currency &amp; therefore that, when it's your personal money, you wouldn't get taxed on it. so a slight bummer and better research needed - but glad i'm still trying to learn and read.with this new found knowledge, i was still fairly satisfied with the impact on me - as i would only be liable for cgt when i disposed of the coins. my plan is to hold until it becomes a currency - so this is not really an issue. at worse it's a 20% tax on something that avoids holding a mass inflation of gbp in this time.reading into the hmrc paper though, they are counting a disposal of btc (for example) not only when you sell for fiat and 'realise the gains', but also if you buy another cryptocurrency with your btc.i hold an equal amount of another coin and have grown these on a 50/50 basis (i view that it is likely to  be the $ to btc's gold position in the market and so both sides could end up being good calls (or both bad :shrug:)). the second coin i can't buy in gbp using the platform i purchase through, so have merrily been buying btc and immediately using the btc/othercoin market to trade it across. slightly more fees, than buying direct, but for my own sanity, i was happy with this.now in the normal world, this shouldn't be an issue as '1' btc held for a short time then used to purchase another coin of the same fiat value hasn't gained any value - so no cgt would be recognised.but... hmrc are pooling the value of btc you hold. so the outcome from dollar averaging. this means that although i buy '1' btc at a cost of 8k to swap it for '1' other coin, if my dollar cost average position is 6k, then i am realising 2k of profit from this trade - meaning that it attracts 400 worth of tax liability.this is obviously a huge impact on something that was a simple 'lazy' step around having to use two exchanges to buy the two different coins, but i am sure that i am not the only one - especially when the exchange i use has absolutely no information on the btc/other currency markets to suggest that it attracts on this basis.am i the only one who has fallen into this hole? am i reading this wrong? original source documentation from hmrc is here: [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-on-cryptoassets/cryptoassets-for-individuals](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-on-cryptoassets/cryptoassets-for-individuals) i keep seeing pictures of bitcoin ads found in the wild posted here, which is exactly how i learned about it for the first time. so whoever paid for that billboard on lawrence expressway. thank you, sir! &gt;it started back in june, amid the nationwide protests over the death of george floyd, when brian armstrong, the companys extremely introverted cofounder and ceo,  was asked a question at an employee town hall about why coinbase had  not shown public support for the black lives matter movement. armstrong  declined to give a clear answer, according to crypto news site the block, and his avoidance resulted in a virtual walkout by hundreds of coinbases 1,100 employees on june 3.in response, armstrong has made coinbase's mission clear: it's not political. he has given severance packages to employees who disagree. and this, i believe, is how any business ought to be run. if you want to make \*everything\* political, you should join a political party. corporations and businesses are not political. it's no different from the separation of church and state. you ought to separate business from political, especially the feverish social-justice-warrior kind.i think armstrong deserves some goddamn respect for having a spine.fyi- bitcoin isn't about race. it isn't a "white supremacist" technology. most bitcoin miners are living in china. it's a global asset. inventor satoshi nakamoto specifically designed bitcoin to be able to process transactions on slow third-world internet connections (and it does work in africa, and india, too). bitcoin was always, first and foremost, a \*human\* technology, for everyone to use to avoid financial censorship.insurgent employees trying to blackmail their own ceo into making everything about race **is not ok**. the amish is the first example of a real life bitcoin fork:nah, were gonna keep ridin our horses and using candles. we dont want any of that electricity nonsense the financial system is on the verge of collapse, and there are no superheroes who can turn the tide in the real world.therefore, we must learn how to rely on our own hands to protect the money we have earned.currently, the best way is to store funds outside the traditional financial system.decentralized finance, or defi for short, may become a killer application in the banking industry.**what exactly is defi?**this is an ecosystem of financial applications built on the blockchain (especially ethereum), which can operate independently without the intervention of third parties or intermediaries.in 2020, the defi economy has grown by us$4 billion and is currently one of the fastest growing sectors in the financial sector.**the main problem with defi**currently the only truly decentralized financial application is bitcoin.anyone with access to the internet can store and transfer funds in a decentralized manner.but defi has made a further commitment: to introduce decentralization into the mainstream public view.this will provide a global and open alternative to all financial services including savings, loans, investment and insurance.next, we will introduce three defi use cases that are sufficient to disrupt the traditional banking industry:**1. stablecoins**stablecoin is the first defi use case to achieve a blowout development.the idea of a cryptocurrency free from the long-term instability of bitcoin is very attractive to many people.on the one hand, it has price stability similar to the us dollar or the euro; on the other hand, it also has the speed and convenience of cryptocurrency.the stablecoin perfectly combines the advantages of the two.currently, about 80% of encrypted transactions are conducted through tether stablecoin.at the same time, other companies, such as usdc, truusd, dai or pax, have also experienced explosive growth in the past year.therefore, the stable currency market definitely deserves our continued attention and expectation.after all, most bank customers are tired of inefficient and expensive services and increasing government supervision.**2. decentralized exchanges**decentralized exchange (dex) is one of the most breakthrough innovations derived from defi.in recent years, the number of dex has also shown explosive growth.according to data from dune analytics, monthly transaction volume in 2020 has grown to nearly $12 billion.so, what is dex?the essence of dex is a cryptocurrency platform, users assets can be traded without going through an exchange.therefore, the risk of being stolen and attacked by hackers can be greatly reduced.currently, the most popular dex platforms are curve, balancer, 0x, dydx, kyber, bancor, idex, oasis and gnosis protocol.but in fact, the ultimate reason for attracting people to join dex is the growing and more complex know your-client process (kyc) demand.it stripped the anonymity of customers and caused financial exclusion of more than 2.4 billion people.they are like cancer, engulfing the entire banking system alive.**3. borrowing and lending applications**to say the most compelling development in the defi field, one has to mention decentralized lending platforms.the defi lending platform can provide loans to users or companies without any intermediaries.anyone can deposit their available assets into the shared loan pool, and those who want to borrow can withdraw assets from the pool.currently, the most popular defi loan platforms are compound, maker, aave and dydx.at the same time, companies such as blockfi, celsius, cred, nexo and crypto.com also provide annual interest rates of up to 10%.the lending platform enhances the flexibility of banking business and removes strict threshold restrictions on the location, identity, and assets of customers.this use case is expected to lead defi into the mainstream market.**4. insurance**the form of defi insurance is still relatively conservative.it mainly acts as a safety net in the defi ecosystem.users no longer need traditional banks or institutions to ensure the safety of their deposits.although decentralized insurance is not popular in the entire defi community at present, it is likely to disrupt the entire insurance industry in the future.if you want to learn about insurance products other than traditional insurance companies, you can check out nexus mutual, opyn, etherisc and cdx.**next, where are we going?**defi is an interesting idea with trillions of dollars in potential.if we compare defi with the traditional financial system, it is not difficult to find the fatal attraction in defi.as you can see, some defi projects have replaced part of the business in the centralized encryption economy, and it will not be long before it will begin to replace the traditional banking and insurance industries.now, the financial system needs to be repaired-to make it more transparent, open and efficient.otherwise, if we dont properly wrap up this broken financial system, 20 years later, we will eventually pay for our stupidity at this moment.source:[https://trusple.network/20201004411.html](https://trusple.network/20201004411.html) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] welcome

[removed] i think it would be interesting to take a few coins and blast them out on a monthly or quarterly basis to some friends, family, etc. it would be almost like a dividend distribution of sorts, or maybe similar to a bitcoin faucet? for example, 50% btc, 20% eth, 10% xmr, 5%bch, 5% link, 5% xrp, 5%atom.i'm not going to manually go in and send all these, but if i could set up a one time thing that distributed it automatically, that would be pretty helpful. has anyone done something similar, if so, i appreciate the feedback or maybe pointing me in the right direction. tia! distx is a new token sale platform with a lot of cool features for token sale holders and participants. great benefits for token holders! the plaform will launch on october 28th 2020.*please read this article for info about distx:*[https://medium.com/@distx/distx-the-most-rewarding-and-flexible-token-sale-platform-77e1d63f44e7](https://medium.com/@distx/distx-the-most-rewarding-and-flexible-token-sale-platform-77e1d63f44e7)progress of distx in the first 14 days after public sale:[https://medium.com/@distx/distx-project-update-past-present-and-future-563c9260ca2a](https://medium.com/@distx/distx-project-update-past-present-and-future-563c9260ca2a)some great things about this projects proces:\- founders frequently online and answering questions on telegram every day\- moved their launch date forward by 2 months\- great community\- a few new partnerships every week\- expanded the team with new members\- smart contract ready to be audited\- top 50 nft giveaway\- first tokensales are on the agenda\- and lots more!what makes distx different compared to competitors?their main competitor is probably trustswap or unilayer launchpad. however, they focus on one key aspect which is the sale and escrow part of distx does. distx offers a more holistic approach, they help teams go from nothing to a fully launched project. distx does uniswap, token generation, distribution, and connect with partners for additional services, like youtubers (bitboy) and much more. they even are in the process of securing a partnership with a reputable auditing firm. distx is building an entire ecosystem to help teams launch their projects.and that's only on the team side, distx also help users find token sales they want to participate in and give them full transparency over what the team has selected. did they lock team tokens, liquidity, add it to uniswap, are they public, anon, did they pass kyc and so much more.*whitepaper:*[https://distx.io/downloads/distx-whitepaper.pdf](https://distx.io/downloads/distx-whitepaper.pdf)*token sale info:*10m distx presale sold out15m distx public token sale sold out in under 60 seconds!*token details:*distx tokenstotal supply: 50mcirculating supply: 32m*founders:*adrian daluz [@mshuu](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=%40mshuu)daniel abela [@dacryptoaus](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=%40dacryptoaus)*usefull links:*coingecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/distx](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/distx)check out socialpages on:  [https://www.distx.io/](https://www.distx.io/)official token contract address: 0x4b4701f3f827e1331fb22ff8e2beac24b17eb055if they do it right, distx can be the solution for all the rugpulling that is happening lately. with launch within a month and marketing starting now, this project could be a huge succes! [removed] so far i really like the idea of cryptocurrency, but i really dislike the idea of bitcoin. it's a giant waste of resources for no good reason. even leaving the mining of it aside, "each bitcoin transaction consumes 250kwh, enough to power homes for nine days."

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] hi everybody,i am writing this post today as i tried to introduce the concept of cryptocurrencies to my parents this weekend (both in their 50s) and especially the prospect of investing in it but they were so reluctant i found it really hard to push the idea to them. the main reason is that they dont want to put any money on something they dont understand, even when were talking about a couple hundred bucks.i certainly dont want to push anything onto then too much but i feel like it could be interesting to introduce them to an industry i consider revolutionary and the last thing i want is to look like a crypto-nut when i try to explain anything.do you happen to have some go to material to show your loved ones that introduced this concept to them nicely, a sort of eli5 of blockchain and the crypto space in general?i would be curious to hear some anecdotes of people who successfully (or not!) brought their loved ones to the industry.wishing you all a nice sunday! [removed] i can't deposit funds from coinbase pro to coinbase. i'm seeing a message saying "funds on hold." i contacted support weeks ago and only receive automated messages -- the first one asked me to respond or have the matter closed, but there was no previous message to respond to.everything after that has been generic messages asking me to confirm that the matter is resolved. i don't think a human agent has read my messages or looked into my account, and i'm unable to cash out my crypto into fiat. has this happened to anyone else? what can i do?

[removed] [removed] [removed] i just want everyone to know how insanely excited i am about the progress crypto as a whole has made since the 2017 bull market.  the fundamentals are 10x better now than back then.  all this is happening while the legacy fiat system is cannibalizing itself from greedy policy-makers increasing the divide between the rich and poor.\*while the legacy system interest rates are kept artificially low, the free-markets in crypto are seeing interest rates of 10+% on stablecoins like usdc. demand for stablecoins is absolutely exploding to take advantage of this.  it's important to understand the role stablecoins will play in all of this and usher in new money into this industry. why hold fiat?\*real usecases have emerged that are simply more efficient than the legacy systems. defi, nft's, asset tokenization, etc. eventually the more efficient systems win, it can be delayed, but not avoided.\*all this is happening while bitcoin's fundamentals are getting better and better.  there are many ways buying bitcoin can now produce yields without selling, the hashrate has gone up 10x since 2017, and the institutions are starting to add bitcoin to their balance sheet.\*holy shit am i excited for the future!!! what will be the suggested eth 2.0 return on staking? how will this compare to the inflation from new supply? if a user doesn't have 32 eth, will staking even be worth it a stake pool takes a piece of the rewards?thank you!

 | original | number | shifted | encrypted | number | chinese ||----|----------|--------|---------|-----------|--------|---------|| 1  | oppose   | 1245   | 1956    | mosquito  | 1153   | 5bf6    || 2  | duck     | 543    | 4       | dust      | 547    | 5b57    || 3  | hello    | 855    | 27      | hotel     | 882    | 6162    || 4  | neglect  | 1185   | 1963    | maximum   | 1100   | 7238    || 5  | reveal   | 1476   | 7       | rich      | 1483   | 6c2e    || 6  | key      | 977    | 10      | kitten    | 987    | 6fc3    || 7  | humor    | 889    | 1994    | hair      | 835    | 4e4e    || 8  | mosquito | 1153   | 1       | mother    | 1154   | 5348    || 9  | road     | 1496   | 31      | salute    | 1527   | 95ca    || 10 | evoke    | 625    | 1956    | dream     | 533    | 52e2    || 11 | flock    | 715    | 4       | flush     | 719    | 932f    || 12 | hedgehog | 853    | 27      | hospital  | 880    | 4e95    |to decrypt them and get back your original seed words, the script will accept the encrypted words, their numbers or the unicode codepoints and the same dates you used to encrypt them (again, you can also do all of this by hand and don't need the script at all).note that the last encrypted word will most likely not be a valid checksum word (in the above example, `hospital` is valid, though). having a valid checksum last word can provide plausible deniability in that the encrypted words are in fact encrypted, as they are valid bip-39 seed words. you could even store a small amount of coins there, so if someone ever steals/uses your seed words, that's all they're going to think you have. the script can generate a valid last checksum word for your encrypted words if you want to replace it (if it's already valid, the script will tell you so, and you don't have to replace it), however, it's not possible to decrypt it back to the original checksum word. if you choose to replace it, you will have to remember or write down your original or encrypted last word!you can store the chinese unicode codepoints in multiple ways, since each is 4 characters long (just remember this fact when you want to rebuild your original seed words). you could write it unchanged: `5bf6 5b57 6162 7238 6c2e 6fc3 4e4e 5348 95ca 52e2 932f 4e95`, or, to make it look even more random, as a bunch of hexadecimal characters that return useless nonsense when converted back to text (*[[wabr8l.onnshr/n*), you could write it without spaces: `5bf65b57616272386c2e6fc34e4e534895ca52e2932f4e95`, you could write it with a space every 2 characters: `5b f6 5b 57 61 62 72 38 6c 2e 6f c3 4e 4e 53 48 95 ca 52 e2 93 2f 4e 95`, you could group two or more together: `5bf65b57 61627238 6c2e6fc3 4e4e5348 95ca52e2 932f4e95`, etc. to lookup and convert the unicode codepoints manually, just do a google search of e.g. "4e95 unicode" or use unicode.org's unihan database lookup: https://unicode.org/charts/unihan.html, then find the position of the character in the bip-39 traditional chinese wordlist. i included "mapping_table.txt" and "mapping_table_unicode_sorted.txt" for faster/easier lookup to save you the trouble.optionally, the script can output a 2-out-of-3 recover sheets like this:| sheet 1                    | sheet 2                    | sheet 3                    ||----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|| #1: mosquito / 1153 / 5bf6 | #1: mosquito / 1153 / 5bf6 | #2: dust / 547 / 5b57      || #2: dust / 547 / 5b57      | #3: hotel / 882 / 6162     | #3: hotel / 882 / 6162     || #4: maximum / 1100 / 7238  | #4: maximum / 1100 / 7238  | #5: rich / 1483 / 6c2e     || #5: rich / 1483 / 6c2e     | #6: kitten / 987 / 6fc3    | #6: kitten / 987 / 6fc3    || #7: hair / 835 / 4e4e      | #7: hair / 835 / 4e4e      | #8: mother / 1154 / 5348   || #8: mother / 1154 / 5348   | #9: salute / 1527 / 95ca   | #9: salute / 1527 / 95ca   || #10: dream / 533 / 52e2    | #10: dream / 533 / 52e2    | #11: flush / 719 / 932f    || #11: flush / 719 / 932f    | #12: hospital / 880 / 4e95 | #12: hospital / 880 / 4e95 |write down and store each sheet separately at a different location. please remember that if you replaced the last encrypted seed word with a valid checksum word, you will have to remember or write down your original or encrypted last word somewhere as well!

UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// [removed] can someone please give me a quick rundown? i just met with an old friend, i remember she told me she invested 3 million colombian peso in april, 2017 in bitcoin.that was +/- $1,060 usd that time or +/- $9,400 today.when i told her how much it was worth today she was excited because today that's 36 million peso where i live.and she has a debt to pay to the bank on a loan for an apartment, especially now during the crisis that would put her out of debt instantly.so obviously i asked her if she still had the "seed" or wallet in a secure place, she didn't understand what i was asking.a bit deeper into the conversation she told me her son knew a guy to invest bitcoin, he told her that there was a flat fee of 1 million peso to open up a wallet and the other 2 million would be invested.i told her she got scammed, because she did not have the private key of her wallet and when she asked to get money from her investment this person again lied to her and told her that whats left of today is only 250,000 colombian pesos or $65 usd.there was no contract or anything written on paper, the only thing as evidence she had was a mail on how much money they agreed to invest.i'm thinking now of offering some free/paid advice now trough online marketplaces in my city and country, people need to know they can open a wallet for free and how to purchase bitcoins themselves and how they can secure their investments with a hardware wallet and how to sell their bitcoin.i see daily stories on reddit/twitter/facebook of people getting scammed, ive also been selling hardware wallets trough my online store in my country ( i'm not an authorized distributor but i've prevented some scams where other online sellers sold opened/tampered wallets ) so some background i just bought some bitcoin at a bitcoin atm to try it out. i put $40 in the machine and received $34.80ish worth of bitcoin.the fee at the machine was 15%. $34.80\*1.15 = $40 (which i put in the machine)the machine gives you a link to blockchain explorer where you can see when your transaction becomes confirmed.looking through the transaction, the total fee for the transaction (which i assume is the mining fee) is $6.22so i put $40 in the machine, received $34.80 and the transaction cost $6.22 to process.$34.80+6.22= $41.02, so the machine in fact losing money on the transaction? $41.02&gt;$40&amp;#x200b;my question is the "fees" in blockchain explorer in fact "mining fees"? i know this price changes throughout the day, but $6.22 seems high? and would the company running the machine be actually dumb enough to lose money on the transaction? or can they not control what price the mining fee will be?thanks in advance :) should i be using wasabi tumbler for dark web orders or is sending from coinbase to electrum to market sufficient? hi all, my boyfriend is obsessed with bitcoin. since christmas and his birthday is coming up soon, i wanna get him something bitcoin related that will excites him. do you guys know something that interesting and bitcoin related??

 which one of those calculators (if correctly coded) would be more accurate?as i am a big fan of trust, but verify, i would like to build my own calculator to make sure that the online version i choose is correct.  this may be overkill, but i have been tasked by my boss to complete a feasibility study of building a huge mining farm.  most calculators will only give a right now kind of answer to profitability.  i need to be able to get year over year numbers that include the daily declining profitability.thanks in advance.p.s. if any of you currently own or operate a big mining farm (3000+ asics) and have any advice, pointers, or lessons learned, i would love to hear them. txtenna allows users to transmit bitcoin transactions via sms using gotenna relays.however, it looks like the project has been abandoned.- gotenna is publicly focused on their new pro edition for government agencies.- the txtenna.com site references a conference that occurred 18 months ago.- the github repo hasnt been updated in 18 months.does anybody still use this?

[removed] no doubt that these years were the years of glory!most important years of the technological evolution, revolutionizing the payment system by eliminating third parties and banks' control upon one's capital of money.everyone who read the white paper when published in 2008, and afterwards researched it and understood what bitcoin was while creating a capital waiting to be invested heavily in bitcoin in long term means when it would be launched in 2009 on first price of 0.008, today are filthy rich in terms of us dollars since bitcoin is an anti-fiat asset class.however, not everyone might have understood bitcoin and seen it just as another market to be traded and make money, especially seeing that bitcoin's roi which rose up 900% in price just 5 days after it's price lunch on various markets of exchanges.just imagine back in the day, when with 1$ you could've literally purchased a shitload bag with bitcoins, approx 1.200btc's or even more.or imagine when bitcoin was gifted or given away on reddit and other platforms.. and look where we are now, when with 1$ u barely buy some satoshis, let alone a whole fraction or a whole bitcoin. look where we are now, when bitcoin has become more of a greed game than being generous.to me, it is mindblowing what opportunities were presented for everyone who stumbled across bitcoin back then. a time that will never come back again, ever.i can not comprehend the pain and regrets one might have today who knew about this at the time and did not took action.or, the one's who just traded it due to bitcoin's roi in such a short term and nowadays have not what they had when first bought.arghhh, destiny ... i wish i were not a 7 years old kiddo when bitcoin launched, and especially coming from a third world country when finding internet access was a luxury and impossible for poor-middle classes.let alone mentioning the educational systems that never did any subject upon pc's education.i've been having restless and sleepless nights since i stumbled upon bitcoin early 2020 after covid plunged the markets, and i found bitcoin at it's first price at around 6-7k or something. finding me with not more than 1k in lifesaving to invest, when nearly 20% of my capital went just to get a cold storage wallet.today, i find my self just looking on the web-world bitcoin topics, documentaries behind it's technology, it's revolution etc etc.i feel unlucky and cursed stumbling upon bitcoin 'so late' in terms of price and accumulation.i can never see my self owning a whole bitcoin before 2025-2026 if what i have will be traded succesfully on the next peak to buy in lower after the next ath deep's correction and bear market which is yet to come.and thanks to the covid sh\*t which left me unemployed from having a 250$ salary off taxes to have an income that i can invest monthly, that dream becomes even more far-fetched.i failed pursuing college to get a phd/diploma, or better said, i couldn't due to not having money to begin with. now i'm stuck!i see my future being so gloomy, filled with hardships and thorns not having means of income to go on in life, creating a family or whatever.but hey, to whom am i talking to.. most of bitcoin investors see bitcoin to buy them a lambo, or lavish life access, while i'm standing and seeing bitcoin as an asset that can free me from selling my time for worthless paychecks.. while i'm seeing bitcoin as an asset which can be passed on to upcoming generations.i wonder why god didn't will for me to know about bitcoin back than, and have an unimaginable portfolio today, when 100bitcoin's at current price is equal to 1million u$dollars. an amount which could've settled all my blood relatives from the struggles of fiat money working as slaves, buying some real estate to create passive income and all this with only 50 bitcoins, and the other 50 to be held for long term and be traded twice a year to accumulate more.i wish i was a person when with 1$ could've purchased around 1.000 bitcoins, i have no doubt in my mind that i would've created an webpage for new bitcoin incomers and share with them from my abundance.if anyone who read this till the end and it's an early investor up to 10$ per bitcoin, consider sharing your wealth with your loved ones, friends who understand and want to hodl bitcoin and to strangers the likes of me who didn't had the opportunity to do so.afterall, when we die, we won't get any of wealth possession we might have.cheer up for whatever u have. i have realized life's a b!tch and destiny it's a maze we will never understand from the logical point of view human beings have the ability to think of.i wish you all the best!and do not forget..not your keys, not your coins. i recently sold my remaining stocks (mostly tech like nvda, irony!) because i think the market is overpriced and ripe for a crash. the problem is, i put 100% of my money in bitcoins. if bitcoin crashes, i'll be in serious, serious trouble. maybe even homeless.the thing is, i don't want to sell bitcoins because i know they will be going higher. i should really sell 2-3 so i have a little cushion but i don't want to. i wanna keep my bitcoins &gt;.&lt;&amp;#x200b;i do have a jobs but income is sporadic and if i lose money on bitcoins i will basically lose everything i have, and will have to start from scratch. no retirement plan, no savings (other than btc), etcthoughts? as far as i understood, the recent floating-point nakamoto consensus debate was to fix a so-called "someone-head issue". but what is it? increasingly seeing this

[removed] i having a discussion with my roommate today about how crypto has a finite number of blocks so limited number of coins that can be mined. what im wondering is, how do these coins actually obtain a $ value? where is this tracked and how can coins increase in time? i'm a crypto novice and have been reading a lot about 3commas bots. does anyone have experiences to share using their bots? specifically the gordon bot as it requires the least expertise from what i can tell.however, the barrier to entry for that bot is a $600 a year subscription to the service. if i gave the bot $500-$1000 to trade for a year what are the chances of it generating enough to even break even with the subscription price? also factoring the commission from an exchange like coinbase.... i see people claiming unbelievable consistent returns (1-3% daily) but it seems too good to be true. i understand the inherent volatility and am looking for some 1st hand knowledge from people who have tried 3commas bots. thanks. [removed] [removed] so i've slowly been getting rid of my ltc in favor of more btc and some other coins. i am experiencing a weird issue when i sent some ltc to cb pro this morning. transaction completed just fine, after about 45 minutes, but it wasn't updating my ltc wallet balance. even though the transaction is listed in the deposits summary. here is the[ tx hash](https://live.blockcypher.com/ltc/address/mkqbrdrevfxzt6wogm4f7ntmmytwrdcjp2/).then i noticed that from my wallet address, it shows through the hash that it's being sent out to 2 other addresses. how is this possible? i have never seen this before and now my wallet balance says 0. what does this mean? [removed] [removed] i have a question about uniswap. i am new to it, and ethereum as well. i just created a metamask wallet, transfered about $20 to it, then went to [uniswap.org](https://uniswap.org), connected the wallet and converted about $7 to dai just to see how it works. i looked at the transaction on [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) and it said it will be confirmed in about 12 minutes or something like that, so i sat there just watching it, then it changed to 3 hours... it was late so i was like i will check on it tomorrow. so now it looks like it failed completely with: " **fail with error 'uniswapv2router: expired'** " [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7c2cdf2141ee488d8e52c13c7f2aed18bbe31932056bf194ba413f1f247f07da](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7c2cdf2141ee488d8e52c13c7f2aed18bbe31932056bf194ba413f1f247f07da)i didn't want to just blindly retry it because it looks like ethereum fees are charged regardless of it working or not. so was this just incredibly bad luck, or i did do something wrong?

[removed] so i was at a bitcoin atm earlier buying coins and a old lady walks up to me and asks can i use your phone number to send the security code to so i can use the bitcoin atm? my phone wont let me get the security code for some reason. of course i said no even after she begged but i was wondering what was the point of her asking me this i'd like to see satoshi added to this site.[https://www.path-to.org/newton.html](https://www.path-to.org/newton.html)[https://twitter.com/williamevanl/status/1313647219657109506](https://twitter.com/williamevanl/status/1313647219657109506)can bitcoin do it's hive thing and get this going? :) bitcoins number of unique active users has hit an all-time high, according to data from *glassnode*.  having reached 375,000 in late december 2017, the number of active entities has now passed 380,000, and looks set to continue growing.could a surge be imminent?[https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/bitcoin-passes-all-time-high-number-of-active-users-is-surge-imminent/](https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/bitcoin-passes-all-time-high-number-of-active-users-is-surge-imminent/) [removed] [removed] [deleted] anyone actually used them? got something similar you recommend instead?no company information published and no email response. [removed] i recently came across a new desktop wallet that i am really impressed with. it's called sparrow and so far, i really like it.it seems to do all of the things that i need/want out of a desktop wallet but i was wondering if anyone in here has done any experimenting with it and if they have any thoughts good or bad about it.https://sparrowwallet.comthanks in advance, all. i'm a 2011 btc veteran. as such, i find myself using tools that become outdated and don't keep up with what's new anymore. you get set in your ways. i've used mycelium as a phone wallet for what seems like forever. it used to be simple and sleek. there were development plans for some interesting tools that never came to be. i just looked in the app for the first time in a while and it's become bloated with spammy media feeds and other sponsors that reek of desperation. if i were to recommend something that looks like a malware infected early 2000s webpage to a friend, it's got all the bells and whistles to drive them away. it's finally the sad time to dump mycelium and take my spending keys elsewhere. (rip crowdfunding coins donated long ago)what is everyone's phone wallet choice these days and why? i have used many over the years, they all have their strengths and quirks. my mom called me this morning in a panic. her phone was stolen a few days back and the thief called her pretending to be the ssa (we have already reported this to the ssa). the thief asked her to withdraw her checking account funds and to deposit it at a nearby bitcoin of america atm. they didn't provide any information for her to enter so it was all her personal info.  after she deposited the money they asked her to send a picture of the receipts and the qr codes. at that point she finally realized something was fishy, refused to send the pictures and decided to go to the police to file a report. we have a fraud case number and we've contacted banks, bills, etc to ensure nothing else happens moving forward. the issue is that neither myself nor my mother know a single thing about bitcoin. i've already tried calling and emailing bitcoin of america but haven't heard back. is any way to get the money back or to recover a portion of it? any advice would be greatly appreciated! so i just looked my electricity price up and i pay +-0,13 kwhis there any mining thing i could run in my studio that isnt too loud and around 500? or am i being too picky? today, i have finally downloaded the full block chain and am running a full bitcoin node (took \~3days).i have a blockchain explorer, but i still need to work on installing and running lightning network, and exploring other tools. it's a good

matter of time before bitcoin is worth millions and then billions of dollars per btc. i'm probably calling it 40-100 years ahead of time.weak hands will lose the long game in bitcoin. every time a weak seller sells, a deep holder will buy it up. eventually bitcoin winds up in the titanium hands of true bitcoiners who will never sell.i think this is what michael saylor ceo of microstrategy was thinking. bitcoin is the perfect system for usurping value from all other forms of money. it's a financial virus in a way.bitcoin rewards you based on how soon you figure this out. the sooner you buy the better. and bitcoin will always be the best long term investment no matter when you buy it. just be patient and never sell.bitcoin is money. just buy stuff with it when you want to take profit. you never need to sell bitcoin.the fewer sellers, the higher the price obviously. currently have funds on bittrex. there are bitaccess atms around me. bills are due and unfortunately i need to cash out some of the holdings that i've had for years. thanks guys. just curious as to how this community feels.is the price stabilization of bitcoin something that most people want or are most people still looking for volatility. i would imagine that the stabilization would lead to greater adoption and may lead to people actually using it as a currency, but it may also lead to slower appreciation of bitcoin.lately it seems to be a slow steady movement relative to some of the swings we are used to seeing. i for one am ok with the slow growth as it gives me a sense that bitcoin adoption is starting to find its footing and i find the adoption to be far more important than swing trading. what is the best argument to convince parents (instinctively distrustful of bitcoin) to invest at least 1% of their wealth in bitcoin ? every once in a while i subject myself to reddit and try to post something on here. i think namely that one of the major issues is that reddit just doesn't have an advanced community. the lawyers and finance people are all on crypto twitter. but for the small handful of people who are business savvy here i will at least try to make a point in the interest of overall views and exposure.&amp;#x200b;basically everything i chicken littled about on reddit last summer has come true. i made a lot of claims and told people that the banking secrecy act and fatfa would be incredibly terrible. and the reality is i wasn't chicken littling.i understand the laws and am good at legal research. and all the crypto lawyers will say what i have said. we are largely fucked. unless we really mass protest and complain at the cftc and sec and members of congress, we are going to get bent over a barrel. wallstreet likes excluding retail, they don't want competition from 'the poors' let's be fucking real, they don't want retail involved because they are making too much money backdoor. it is they who are allowing this, and allowing the us citizen to be excluded from 95% of the crypto ecosystem and subjected to .5% fees on coinbase.&amp;#x200b;they are already laying the groundwork to go after defi developers all over the world extrajudicially and will. there is virtually nothing anyone can do to stop fatf and the doj persecuting anyone with an admin key to any smart contract any where in the world. they do not fucking care about borders or sovereignty. this is america, we drone strike weddings.if you have a  business, if you are a trader, or any person educated and trained enough in legal and finance to have skin in the game and you aren;t just a reddit 12 year old person hurling insults because you don't have a penny to your name, you need, we need, to heavily heavily involve ourselves in regulator dialouge with the cftc and sec.if non institutional entrepreneur and citizen in america do not start actively pressuring and speaking with the cftc and sec we are potentially going to be persona non grata in much of the world for crypto. especially the cftc. the obsession that retail has with the sec is deeply misleading. it is the cftc that has pushed most of the exclusion. even if you do not trade derivatives, it will be cited as a reason for why you are being denied services, that is just the reality of the situation.&amp;#x200b;moreover, i still believe that they are going to create a parrallel system of white listed and black listed bitcoins, and backdoor wallets and hardware wallets with kyc in the 39 fatf member country. i believe that at least 50 to 70% of the btc supply is going to be taken out of these fatf countries through blacklisting. they will simply stop letting you cash out non white listed coin with chain analysis proof of history on fatf/g20 countries. monero won't work, your mixers won't work. if you don't have a chain of custody you will be flagged, and they won't let you withdraw to a "wild" wallet.&amp;#x200b;they'll find a way to make sure that if you live in those 40 to 50 countries that you will not be able to spend a fucking penny of anonymous crypto, unless it is all under the table between merchants, who of course will be thrown in pentitentiary for violating the bsa as a vasp.grown ass adults want to do business, this lowest common denominator shit on reddit and hodl and defi pie in the sky catch me if you can john mcafee arthur hayes shit is coming to an end-- so either get with the program and get congress to pass things like the security clarity act and digital commodity exchange act, or get left out and banned from everything.the rich in america get want they want. they will force this on the world and trade bitcoin on hedgefunds like treasury notes and default credit swaps between the rich without it ever seeing the light of day beyond coinbase, and it'll essentially be a speculative hedge for the mega wealthy, unless the public puts an extreme amount of pressure on us regulators. and frankly everyone outside of the us should put the pressure on us regulators, let's be fucking real people, us regulations on finance are global regulations. ###status of the bitcoin network as of tuesday, october 06, 2020 at 12:00:02 est:**total bitcoins:**

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] just finished a book by siam kidd, lots of pretty straight forward points but some good tips. he says that he generally puts 0.25% at max at risk. how much would you say? perhaps not of your entire capital, but risk capital. traditional companies, if you want to call them that, usually have a need for financial forecasting - be it for internal purposes, fundraising or other reasons. one would think that the same goes for cryptocurrency companies, as they also need to have some kind of idea about their financial situation and outlook.obviously, neither crypto companies nor non-crypto companies can make accurate predictions about the future. however, traditional companies can make reasonable estimates about their revenues by looking at what they plan to spend on marketing, expected conversion rates, arpa, etc. - i'm not going to pretend to be an expert on the topic but there are many ways for them to create financial models.i was wondering how cryptocurrency companies are able to create anything comparable to that. of course, there are many different business models involved and no answer will fit all cases. but as far as i understand, in many cases the companies' revenues depend on their own coin value, which as we all know is unpredictable.does anyone have experience working in the field and can explain how this is handled? [removed] [removed] first off, do you think this is a good thing? personally i do not believe taking opportunity away from retail is good and limits opportunity for those poorer people. however a counter would be that big business is manipulating retail and becoming richer off the back of desperate retail investors, hard one to balance.secondly how is the market going to look in the uk without retail investors in any crypto derivative? b2b competition,  this could get really interesting, whale vs whale rather than whale rekt retail?any thought's appreciated. [removed] [removed] this is something worth considering, if you have a lot of moons locked up in lp or as xmoons in the xdai network.currently, the reddit team have warned not to move the tokens of reddit app or rinkeby testnet.when moving to mainnet, its possible that reddit wont announce the snapshot date before hand, because those who havent **earned** moons will be able to market buy moons and swap it on xmoons exchange or some other app and bring it onto the rinkeby network.announcing snapshot date is required for icos who are launching mainnet, so that those with the placeholder coins can make plans accordingly. for reddit community points, it serves no real purpose.if you read all the community points post and faqs, its clear reddit want people to **earn** these moons for contributing on reddit, and not market buy a bunch and then vote/sell/profit from them. nowhere does reddit mention how to acquire the community points other than by contributing to the sub.there are too many coins which are focussed on just trading or profiting from, while reddit community points/moons tries to be a coin that represents ownership in the sub for actually contributing to the sub.for the snapshot, its possible that we may see an unannounced snapshot of the rinkeby network moons and anyone who has them will be able to get them back on the mainnet. for those who have moons on xdai or any other network, they may miss out on the moon mainnet swap.announcing the snapshot date is not going to serve reddit's goal with community points, but just help traders/speculators - which is not the goal of reddit at all. hello,i own the safepal hardware wallet.when i try to create an ada wallet my only options are "ada (bep20)" and "ada (bep2)" and "cdo (trc10)".i had to convert it to bep20 using binance and withdraw to the wallet. is there another way of doing this? what are the consequences of storing it as bep20?

[removed] [removed] [removed] perhaps someone more akin to understanding the relatively complex wording of the press release can break it down for us uk investors.i had a couple of queries:my first being, where can we find information regarding which platforms or exchanges that offer cryptocurrency derivatives are going to be told to cease their operations? as from my research and interpretation of the recent press release, as far as i can tell, provided retail clients seek the product (in this case cryptocurrency derivatives) from a third country firm, trading derivatives will still be allowed post january 6, 2021 in the uk?is there a list of what the fca determines a 'third country firm' to be, and what firms are included within that list?i believe with binance soon releasing a uk specific exchange which can be used either by itself, in tandem with or not at all with binance's main exchange (binance), would not have a futures exchange.  from what i am able to interpret, binance would be considered a 'third country firm' however binance uk would not.does this mean, uk citizens are of free will to use binance, and not binance uk, and thus continue trading futures post jan 6, 2021?as my understanding would be, that the exchange of crypto currency derivatives would cease operations on binance uk where the fca has a jurisdiction, however uk retail investors would be free to trade crypto currency derivatives on the main binance platform which i believe falls outside of the jurisdiction of the fca?thanks!

the neverending year is entering the final quarter and is not finished with us yet: a lot can and will happen in the remaining months. more volatility is no doubt to come as we enter the final stretch of a truly unpredictable and exhausting year. buckle up.stay healthy and take care of yourselves out there.thanks for reading and for supporting the experiment. i hope youve found it helpful. i continue to be committed to seeing this process through and reporting along the way. feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports. keep an eye out for the original[2018 top ten crypto index fund experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-33)and the[2019 top ten experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-21)follow up experiment.## and the answer isa) uniswapas part of the defi/dex wave, in late august/early september,[uniswap surpassed coinbase in trading volume.](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-flippening-uniswap-topples-coinbase-trading-volume) https://medium.com/dfohub/a-black-hole-in-uniswap-v2s-front-end-router-is-draining-the-value-of-tokens-26f5a459b5d7as you've all probably heard, there have been some questionable decisions done on the centralized uniswap frontend website, registered in boston and operated by hayden and his team. the website has been hard-coded so that whenever you swap any two tokens, you are getting routed only through weth, dai, usdc, usdt, comp and mkr.this results in a price disparity between the different pairs which allows vampiric "arbitrage" bots to swoop in and extract eth from liquidity pairs. do note that this is not "typical" arbitrage, this arbitrage comes from the fact that users are getting routed through sub-optimal coin routes, which means the profit that the bots receive comes from the fact that uniswap users are getting overcharged, i.e you pay more money than you would have paid for the same amount of coins had you gone through the optimal route.on one such bot (https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe7f0897239ce9cc6645d9323e6fe428591b821c) you can see 24k transactions in 11 days with over 371 ether collected. in the last 18 hours, this bot alone has collected over 20 ether from uniswap traders and liquidity providers.however, that's not the end of it. uniswap's team and hayden are straight up denying this problem even exists, and messages about it are getting deleted from discord and people are getting threats of bans. this raises a very obvious question - are hayden and the rest of the team actually the ones who are running these bots and sapping the liquidity providers and coins themselves for their own vampiric gains? why else would they be covering this up instead of swiftly working to fix it? it's their own service that's suffering and one temporary solution that's been suggested to the uniswap team is to revert to routing only through eth, which is the way it's been done in uniswap v1. instead, the team is denying any problems and deleting messages that raise it up.for end users, an obvious solution is to switch to a different dex. however, uniswap is leading by far in terms of liquidity. another possible solution would be to switch to a uniswap frontend that correctly routes through the optimal liquidity pairs. it is definitely no surprise that in the last few hours metamask has come out and claimed they will be adding a token swap feature to the metamask wallet: https://blockchain.news/news/ethereum-based-wallet-metamask-adds-token-swaps-featuresthe metamask token swap feature seems to automatically swap your coins using uniswap, kyber, 0x api, 1inch.exchange, and more, depending on which one is the most profitable for the user. i would urge everyone here to stop using the app.uniswap.org frontend, and switch to using metamask's dex swap feature or some other service. [removed] [removed] [removed] looking for more creative solutions than leaving it in a cold wallet. does anyone have any experience investing it on compound of aave for example? or loaning it to uniswap for liquidity. are these secure options? and does anyone use argent app for any defi investing? [removed] [removed] having spent the last few days under enormous stress due to an invalid phrase, i want to remind everyone here of the importance of being absolutely certain that you write down your phrase correctly.  i also recommend that, if possible, double checking that it is valid before taking any action that would result in you needing to use it.most importantly, if you find yourself with an invalid phrase, dont panick!  focus on finding the solution without opening yourself up to more risk.  there are relatively simple ways to figure out the problem thanks to some awesome people who have developed open source tools to help in this situation. if you take your time in using them correctly, and take all available safety precautions, you will be successful.  in my case it was a misspelled word, which happened to be another word on the bip39 list.

UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// hi im wondering what the best beginner bitcoin wallet would be. a lot of them have tons of mixed reviews.my purpose in using bitcoin is that a company i regularly order from is no longer accepting regular credit/debit cards. [removed] hypothetically, if an average us citizen wanted to buy $100k of btc and didnt want to go through coinbase and the fees, how would that work? i always see how whales or corporations buy large $ amounts of btc over the counter (sorry if im wrong on the term) and do it through a way that doesnt effect the market or with large fees like coinbase charges.. is it even possible for a normal person to do this? if so how? if not then whats the best way to buy a larger $ amount of btc with the least amount of fees. thanks in advance! [removed] im looking for the best bitcoin wallet for investing,gambling online, etc.thank you! hi i'm just doing some research on bitcoin. does anyone have source for this? thanks so,ach deposit (free), 2-4 day wait.debit card deposit(3.49%), 2-3 day wait.how on earth is there a 3 day hold on a debit card deposit? what the heck are we paying the fee for?

(we talked more about btc than about the chair lol)i would never imagined that one day i would sell something for btc! curious about learning how they're generated programmatically from public addresses. can it be done with a simple python script or is there some github repository?

from mid-2017, i observe that block sizes are exceeding the 1mb mark.to the best of my knowledge, this is due to a new protocol called segwit, but when measuring blocksizes in a different unit, for example weight units or vbytes, blocks are still capped at 4m weight units or 1m vbytes.i am very interested in a data file that contains the size of blocks in weight units or vbytes. is there a method that translates the data of a block to its size in weight units  / vbytes?thank you! i'm with interactive investor in the uk who don't allow direct purchase of bitcoin, any of the europe etns or us funds like grayscale in their self invested personal pension.  seems the only proxy out there for bitcoin that i can invest my uk pension wrapped fiat in is microstrategy.i know that hargreaves lansdown uk users had access to some of the europe bitcoin etns? but i guess that won't be happening anymore after the fca in the uk has banned everything like that.what other options are there for uk pension holders?for clarity: i'm talking about fiat that is locked into a (uk) pension.  if i could i would obviously remove funds and buy bitcoin directly into addresses i hold private keys for.  but the constraint here is it has to be done from within a uk pension using existing funds. if i buy 100 usd of btc on monday, and the price of btc is 10,000then i buy 100 usd of btc on friday, and the price of btc is 10,500then i buy 100 usd of btc on saturday, and the price of btc is 10,200&amp;#x200b;it might be difficult to track the amount of value each purchase actually has with the rise and

people the power over their own money, i think the upcoming fed coin/digital dollar is going to be complete tyranny.the federal reserve and other private banks will issue this crypto currency soon, remove cash from society and make it to where you have to use it. if you are considered a dissenter you will just have your fed coin zapped from your account, won't be able to get loans, they will have complete control over your money. if you give your child $100 for his/her birthday bam it's taxed at 20%, your kid spends that $80 bam taxed again at 20% and over and over until it's all eaten up through taxation. under the table transactions will be impossible.i think crypto currency is about to be used for control over people and world governments are likely to shut down crypto exchanges and make it illegal to use alternate money. look at china and their social credit score system, we're moving more and more towards a surveillance state and the last key is the crypto dollar.anyone that says this is all conspiracy can just look back at the first stimulus bill of this year, the us congress already tried passing it, it's just a matter of time until they succeed.what do you guys think?

just bought 1800 worth of btc today to my collection ;) i wanted to withdraw money from my bitcoin wallet, so i went to bitcoinmat general bytes, and requested to sell bitcoin, sent bitcoin into correct address it asked me to send to, sms came right away that transaction arrived. i am using mycelium, i put in there as priority transaction with like third highest miner fee. it said under 10 minutes, but i guess not. i did it like 45 minutes ago, not a single confirmation. what is happening? i had to leave to catch my bus i didn't expect it to take more than half a hour when it said 10 minutes.so i guess my question is, i can withdraw my money also like few days from now  even if it gets confirmed today or not?and why does it take so long? almost hour in and still nothing. it can't take this long can it? most of my bitcoin is still on paper wallets and not moved since the 2017 forks and with that in mind i think i need a security checkup.part of me says i should move them onto my ledger x for safety but another part says thats then a single point of failure.so my simple question is are paper wallets (created offline using the bitadress code iirc) as secure as a ledger x? and is there any benefit to moving these balances now? all 535 members of congress are about to become bitcoiners after a new initiative [crypto for congress](https://bitcoinmaximalist.net/every-member-of-congress-to-earn-free-bitcoin/) was launched. it's designed to help them learn about the 'capabilities of bitcoin and blockchain technology.' so i placed an order on a website and the order expired and i can get a refund. the site says i need to get the signed transaction from the market, then go to coin.ib to sign the transaction with the key from my first wallet address. this is the part that's confusing me at the mo. i used mycelium and don't really know what i'm doing when it comes to refunds as i've never been in a position to need one. i set up an electra wallet to receive the refunds and the market knows the address it needs to send the refund to, but it's asking for all this coin.ib stuff. i get to the verify bit on coin.ib then when it comes to the sign part i just don't know what to put in the boxes. any help much appreciated. im officially at the point of internet begging, i accidentally crashed my work vehicle and the job market in the uk is worse than this crypto market, i hope this reaches the right person and hopefully i can give back in better times, cheers i want to get into using offline personal wallets rather than just using sites like coinbase and coincorner. the change conjures up a lot of questions though like how do i transfer between cold wallets. is there a transaction fee when receiving btc. is there a tx fee when sending btc?basically does anyone know where a guide would be that i can have a read through which is like a big faq?&amp;#x200b;thank you for your help!p.s. just an observation/opinion - coincorners transfer fees are incredibly high, its not worth it. i prefer coinbase and then i prefer bittylicious over them. is gold as good as it may seem right

[removed] it's funny to see how the money supply is growing faster than the demand by the number of citizens in the usa. we have too much money compared to our average usage!remind that. let's discuss banks.specifically, *commercial* banks.commercial banks are what we think about when somebody says "bank".a commercial bank is a deposit-taking institution that can lend out money.people go to the bank for a car loan, a mortgage, but wait:***where does the money come from?***well, out of thin air.the bank literally types digits into the computer.contrary to blue-pilled belief, the bank does *not* use other people's deposited money to loan you money.***it creates money out of thin air - credit creation.***97% of the money supply is created by banks.only 3% of the money supply is physical cash, and that number is certain to decrease as [cash is dangerous now](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/24/uk-cash-usage-halves-in-few-days) remember...therefore, banks are the control centre of the entire economy, since they create money and decide who gets money *for what purpose*.do the banks create money for productive purposes, boosting gdp and job creation, reducing inequality?***nope, for the last few decades, banks have created money for unproductive purposes, for asset transactions that play no role in gdp (i.e. real estate, stocks, lending to private equity funds and hedge funds).***therefore, asset bubbles form.it is inevitable, as long as banks create new money for asset transactions, people will continue to chase the lucrative capital gains on offer in these asset classes.this has a crucial impact on many people's lives.think about this: private equity giant blackstone buys up real estate, financed by this credit creation at the banks.blackstone has a real estate portfolio of $325 billion, including over 300,000 residential units worldwide.***many people struggling with their rent would be angered to find that blackstone has financed these mammoth deals via credit creation at the banks.***credit creation which could be used for productive purposes, but instead is used to move [schwarzman yet further up the forbes

the human race (and omits those with true power and obscene wealth).so if banks are creating credit for asset transactions, then you will have asset bubbles, banking crises and soaring wealth inequality.the banks are under no obligation from regulators to create credit for productive purposes.create credit for business development, technological innovation, etc?nah, let's lend to blackstone so they can increase their carry.this is why there *is* some valid criticism for the baby boomer generation - they have traded the technological progression of the human race for an increase in their already significant carry.if and when banks slow down credit creation for asset transactions, some speculators (i.e. those who've borrowed money to invest in financial instruments) go bankrupt.then, banks suddenly have nonperforming loans, so they become more risk averse, reducing lending as asset prices fall.***this leads to more bankruptcies, and this vicious cycle then leads to a banking crisis.***[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9qnbpbahiy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9qnbpbahiy) [removed]

experiment, only five cryptos have started in top ten for all three years:**btc, eth, xrp, bch,**and**ltc**(**litecoin**, no pressure, but if youre not back in the top ten in the next few months, youre out of the club). lets take a look at those five:&amp;#x200b;[eth leading the three year

followed by**btc**(+77%). on the other hand, following this approach with**xrp,**i would have been down -31%.alright, thats crypto. how does crypto compare to the stock market?## comparison to s&amp;p 500:im also tracking the s&amp;p 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets. although the s&amp;p fell from an all time high the month before, it is up +35% since january 2019.the initial $1k investment i put into crypto 21 months ago would be worth $1,350 had it been redirected to the s&amp;p 500 in january 2019. +35%, not bad at all. but the 2019 top ten portfolio is up +54% over the same time period.thats 2019. but what if i took the same worlds-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-january-1st crypto approach with the s&amp;p 500? it would yield the following:* $1000 investment in s&amp;p 500 on january 1st, 2018 = $1260 today* $1000 investment in s&amp;p 500 on january 1st, 2019 = $1350 today* $1000 investment in s&amp;p 500 on january 1st, 2020 = $1050 todaytaken together, heres the bottom bottom*bottom*line for a similar approach with the s&amp;p:**after three $1,000 investments into an s&amp;p 500 index fund in january 2018, 2019, and 2020, my portfolio would be worth $3,660.**that is up**+22%** [since january 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/), compared to a**+11%**gain of the combined top ten crypto experiment portfolios.as you can see in the table below, thats a 11% swing***in favor of the s&amp;p 500.*** september breaks a two month mini-streak of wins from the top ten

[removed] although only speculation for now, quantum computing is predicted to be able to break encrypted files within minutes as opposed to hundreds of years with current technology. considering it solves many more problems at once than a traditional computer. how will this effect blockchain and crypto currencies? will they become irrelevant? **nfts** could become big the next years. ethereum has taken the lead as platform, but are there any other blochchain platforms that could lead the way ?first, what are nfts:nft assets are the value medium used to characterize non-monetary assets. thanks to the decentralization, immutability, and cryptographic confirmation of the blockchain, nft solves a series of real problems of real-world assets. an nft or a non-fungible token is a technical term used for crypto collectibles. more precisely, nfts are the digital items that can be collected or used in a game or trade on a blockchain network. nft is among the main developing blocks of the emerging blockchain-powered digital economy, and many projects are experimenting with nfts now.in addition, nft has also achieved features that cryptocurrencies lack, such as characterizing negative assets (liabilities), identity, proof of equity, and virtual prop items. nft fills the gap in crypto assets, allowing us to include assets with independent value into the scope of the crypto economy and obtain the protection of the blockchain.on the ethereum network at the moment, the fees are skyrocketing and that could become a serious problem fort he nft markets and projects that want to build on eth.but there are some new kids on the blockchain:**zilliqa**mintable is a marketplace for digital items on blockchain, the first place to sell and create non-fungible tokens (nfts) on the zilliqa platform. some of the features mintable provides are a very user-friendly selling experience, the ability to sell and describe your nft being sold, the ability to list.zil domain names, 3d image support, and secure private file downloads for files attached to nfts on the blockchain.mintable isn't just on zilliqa though, their beta that has been live since 2018 runs on ethereum. later this year they will be releasing the 2.0 marketplace that runs on ethereum. making mintable the first nft marketplace that has two blockchains supported. with the mintable app, managing and minting crypto assets of your choice have become much easier. users can reap the benefits of the dual blockchain of ethereum and zilliqa, each having exclusive and super-rich features. minting any asset on the mintable zilliqa platform is way cheaper and faster than minting assets on any other similar eth based platforms.[https://medium.com/@edgesun/mintable-an-nft-marketpalce-that-supports-dual-blockchain-zilliqa-ethereum-ecf322e894db](https://medium.com/@edgesun/mintable-an-nft-marketpalce-that-supports-dual-blockchain-zilliqa-ethereum-ecf322e894db)**iost**iost has begun a complete layout of the nft market and has announced the official iost irc-721 nft standard. the official nft standard protocol was launched by iost on april, 2020. developers can use it directly (providing base of issuance), which decrease complexity of join and development. it is more easily for developers to issue nft assets. moreover, this protocol lets nft that based on iost public chain keep the same standardm, and brings the possibility of letting nft assets be re-used in different scenes or between games. iosts nft standard protocol offers the same level of scalability, decentralization, and security of its fungible as well as benefit from its superior resource allocation model that is more effective and much less costly than ethereum.[https://medium.com/iost/iost-unveils-official-irc-721-nft-standard-a0cf297a9c04](https://medium.com/iost/iost-unveils-official-irc-721-nft-standard-a0cf297a9c04)so we see the nft landscape quickly changing and taking shape with some new and exciting developements.

UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// [removed] [removed] bitcoin derivatives marketplace bitnomial has raised $11.6 million from investors, according to a new public filing.in an october 5filing, the firm said it raised the money from 13 different investors, with the first sale dated september 18.coindeskfirst reported the fundraising amount.the blockpreviously reported that bitmonial was seeking to raise as much as $10 million in series b funding. the money from this fundraising period would support the companys ambitious plans to create a market-leading bitcoin exchange in the u.s.back in april, bitnomial was one of the select few u.s. businesses to gain approval from cftc to manage a designated contracts market (dcm). such approval allowed bitmonial to offer bitcoin futures and options, as the block previously reported. long time lurker, first time poster. i have been getting real interested into dca bitcoin and wondering the best method for this and what exchanges you all use. i am in the us and have both coinbase and crypto.com exchanges. should i just use coinbase pro, deposit some cash weekly, and then buy? or do you think doing it every few days is better than weekly? just trying to see the best way to save on fees and what not. any ideas or info is greatly appreciated! i've been looking for tutorials but had no luck. i know woocommerce has 3rd party plugins but i don't want to go that route. i know there is a way to code it yourself so it generates a btc wallet address etc but i have no idea how and can not find info. can anyone point me in the right direction? [removed] [removed] at this point we are out of ideas, so i decided to come to the smartest bunch of people the world has to offer... redditors.the problem is that i recently just became aware and realized that one of the minecraft servers that i was obsessed with back in about 6th grade (around 2010 i believe) used bitcoin as a way to make purchases on the server. this was my favorite server, so for my birthday, my mom gave me $200 dollars to spend however i wanted, and i spent it all on bitcoin so i could get armor, costumes, and stuff like that in the game. a few weeks went by, and just like every other 6th grader on the planet, my interests and hobbies would change quite rapidly, and i stopped playing minecraft. i believe that i spent about $50 worth of bitcoin and the rest is sitting in a virtual wallet waiting for me to access it.now me and my brother have researched everything we could about this in the last few weeks, but as of now, we are not pros and simply know the basics of what we can possibly do. i know i need a 6 digit code to access my wallet, and i specifically remember having the number written on a paper stuck in my room, but i have no clue what that number is and have moved several times since then so there is zero chance of finding that paper.there is a lot of money on the line and if any of you guys have information that could help me get access to my digital wallet i will probably tattoo your reddit name on my body id be so happy.any help you guys could give me i would love but i understand that things like this are highly complex. i appreciate any suggestions or anyone that takes time to help me out. something like that. he was complaining that he sold too soon or something. thanks. i woke up yesterday to someone on discord messaging me that i won 0.72 bitcoin through some giveaway. i was a little skeptical, but i made an account on trade.us, and i got the bitcoin!i wanted to withdraw immediately, so i got a withdrawal address from blockchain.com, but on trade.us, if you're going to withdraw something, you have to deposit at least 0.03, and that's around 350$ and which i don't have.what do i do? hi everyone,i've never bought or own any amount of bitcoin and i'm honestly not very knowledgeable on this topic.recently i've gotten this message from a stranger on discord&amp;#x200b;[discord chat](https://preview.redd.it/e6pew8y69ks51.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4b7f5ad8c14cd954baaef5acdfad8926a3b22f1)i've already made an account and activated the code. but idk if this is even legit. it didn't ask me for any personal info so far. it seems like i can withdraw the amount out of the account to an address.has anyone ever heard of this site? [trade.ug](https://trade.ug)?i'm just confused here. they seem somewhat legit but at the same time. why would they just give away 0.618 bitcoins? that's a lot of money no? i understand if it's marketing for "covid relief" but still....unless you're mr. beast, i don't get how companies can afford to give away 1000s of $ just like that and still survive?&amp;#x200b;anyways let me know your thoughts.&amp;#x200b;thanks i want to start a small backup just in case. i cant use coinbase but are there other good ones anyone can recommend? what actually is bitcoin.  is it like a computer code or like generated letters and numbers thats the key to something.  cant find anything on google and wanted to know from the community. i got hit with ransomware back in 2015. used coin caf to buy $500 (yes i paid - wearing a paper bag over my head) in bitcoin. of course, i bought a few dollars over because bitcoin value fluctuated somewhat. after the pain of this, i didn't want to have anything to do with it anymore and abandoned the account.well, a few months ago, i started getting emails from coin caf saying that i had to log in at least once a year to keep the account open. i ignored the first couple, then said what the heck - i knew the email address because of which of my email addresses it was sent to. did forgot password bit and got into my account. those couple of dollars over were now about $1400!i had to go through an extensive account validation process before i could do any more that just look at the account - email front and back of my driver's license, email photo of me holding the license, email recent bank statement and utility bill, etc. finally, i was able to sell the bitcoin and transfer the balance to my bank account:)coin caf really went the second mile holding my account for so long and pestering me to log in to keep it open. these are really honest people - a less scrupulous outfit could have just done nothing and kept the money. big endorsement of them.the small warning is this - they required extensive documentation to validate the account, as they should have. however, that means that they have all this extensive documentation which, in the wrong hands, could let a hacker open accounts in my name or even take over an existing account. i believe that they have top flight security, but so did {insert company of your choice} when they got hacked. so always be mindful of security - freezing credit bureaus, two factor authentication, complex passwords, etc., and always monitor your accounts.once again, thanks coin caf. i was very active in the btc world 2010-2013 but i was too young at the time to buy any significant amount. need to buy something (cheap) with bitcoin, but i don't know how to use it, and just want the simplest way of buying bitcoin, and using it to purchase something.&amp;#x200b;thanks! [removed] is there any site that accepts paypal other than p2p exchanges? used my cold card for over a month to monitor my balance using the master public key on sentinel.worked fine but just today it failed to load my balance, and kept loading forever, so i reinstalled the app, opened my electrum wallet (skeleton wallet, generated on cold card)and when i used the information option to display my master pub key it displayed it showed my ypub key, i used the qr code option but sentinel fails to add it and the mobile electrum wallet won't let me use it as well...&amp;#x200b;used it for a month just fine before.... really worried now that something is wrong with my keys. what could be the issue, why does no wallet let me monitor my ypub key all of sudden?electrum is still showing my correct balance though.... hi, i am a cs student very interested in blockchain and especially bitcoin.i'm familiar with (most of) the theory behind bitcoin (and also some other coins). currently i'm looking for some hot research topic in blockchain world.what are some of the most important topics that are currently being researched where i can help with my contribution? or what are some topics that may interest you and i can research/program for you? i learned a lot reading about bitcoin and gold, but i was wondering if there is a guarantee that the us dollar will collapse in value? if not, what prevents it from not going down? i know it is the reserve currency of the world but printing more usd doesn't automatically mean there will be high numbers of inflation (or perhaps hyperinflation)?what is the difference in regards to the recent tragic events in turkey, libanon, argentine, venezuela, etc.? is it all because of money printing that these currencies lost all of their purchasing power? it looks as if other countries will follow?i find this very interesting but i still can't see the full big picture. any good sources to keep learning about all this?do you guys believe the euro and dollar one day will completely dissapear? if they go to a digital euro/dollar .. how will that be different from the cash we are using right now?do you think the euro will get the same faith as the usd? i keep reading about money printing in the usa but i hardly read anything about europe (i live in europe btw).i invested a lot of my money into bitcoin. it's actually the only asset i currently bought as an investment. i am thinking about buying stocks (particularly index funds) since every money book i read recommends this and i also want to diversify a little for if btc would fail. now i'm wondering in which index fund i should invest .. i particularly wonder if america will remain the most powerful capitalist country or if china will take over in the next 50 years .. that's the only thing preventing me from investing in stocks. i don't know what to invest in and especially since now all stocks are so high priced ..i know this is kind of a ramble but i would love to gain new perspectives from everybody. thanks for all the insights!

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] this does not really bother me much, but i haven't been able to stop thinking about it either, what could have been, i will try to be as brief as posible:&amp;#x200b;back in 2011-2016 i was working as a software developer freelancer, back then i lived in venezuela, and mostly used paypal to charge clients, paypal would constantly limit my account, but i would get it back after submitting documents and a bit of begging, this was the only way i could receive payments from international clients, and basically the single point of failure in the process of delivering my work and getting paid, if paypal permanently banned me i would be completely screwed.&amp;#x200b;about 2015-2016 my paypal got limited permanently, no reason stated, i thought it was really unfair as i only received payments from business in countries like the us or canada, no sketchy money entering my account, anyway, when this happened i became incredibly stressed and depressed, all i could think was i wouldn't be able to feed my family anymore, and what would i do if an emergency happened that same day or week or however long it took me to figure out how to receive payments again through another method, all i had was held in my paypal account, so i had nothing to defend myself in the meantime.&amp;#x200b;anyway, it took me about a week of constant reading to realize i could convince a few clients to buy crypto for me, i lost about 60% out of my stream of income due to clients ditching me as they didn't want the bother of purchasing crypto just to pay a freelancer they could replace for one that was easier to work with, i used localbitcoins to sell the bitcoins i got for national currency so that i could purchase what i needed, i was not really able to stock up on some bitcoin as an investment as i spent everything i earned due to sustaining my almost the entirety of my immediate family.&amp;#x200b;fast forward to 2016 or 2017, and i start to try out purchasing bits of crypto, and trying to time the market to make a little bit more, doing this somehow i managed to convert about $100, into $400-$500 in a matter of a few months.&amp;#x200b;then hits late 2017, around august i believe, when everyone was purchasing alts like crazy even if they were scams, most people were blinded by greed, me included, it was at that point that i decided to drop work for a few weeks to see if i could make some good profit out of the state of the market, and so i took those $400 or $500, and started to daily trade with it, making 20% sometimes, 30% or 50%, as well as sometimes losing everything i had done during the day, a few of the trades i remember doing was purchasing ltc, xrp, iota, bch and a few more right before they 2x or 3x in price, i was doing swing trades with the entirety of my portfolio, because i realized i could earn more that way, so if i had 5k total in crypto, i would do the swing trade with the entirety of it, and either lose $1000 or make $1000 if it moved 20% in either direction, my only real strategy was to read up on most recent trading discussions on a few social media, which was no strategy at all, i was just being reckless, i remember i could only sleep 2 hours every night because i was afraid of losing everything while being asleep, i set a bunch of alerts, was stressed, didn't want to talk to relatives nor anyone because i would feel like dying when losing 10% or 20% out of my portfolio when it grew to a certain point.&amp;#x200b;anyway, at some point i got up to $20k, or $25k, then decided to put it all in xml because i had read some discussions on it, and realized people seemed to really like it, don't remember exactly what was my entry price, but when xlm almost got up to $0.70 - $1 a few days or weeks later, my portfolio was worth $130k, and it remained that way for a whole 24 hours or so, if i remember [correctly](https://correctly.my) my heart was racing, i thought for sure i was going to make it $1m at some point&amp;#x200b;then, of course, everything started to crash hard... just a few days later my portfolio was worth $80k, a few days more and i was at $60k, i started to panic like any regular silly greedy guy and tried to profit off some swings only to lose more than i would profit from, months of sleepless nights later, with a lot less hair in my head, i finally decided to take it all out, at which point i had about $12k worth of crypto.&amp;#x200b;i used that money to get me, my wife and my mom out of the country, i was also lucky to have dual citizenship thanks to my mom having been born in another country, so i could move to a first world developed european country instead of another struggling country in south america, i was able to set up proper bank accounts so that i could find good clients and make it easier for them to pay me my dues and still use crypto for those that were willing, and of course, i took my work back as a freelancer, although by this point my previous clients had found other people to work with.&amp;#x200b;in the end things turned great, i suppose, i would not have been able to save up those same $12k while working as a freelancer back in venezuela, not even close, that whole experience got me out of that awful country and way of life, still, i can't stop thinking that if i at least had gotten out at $80k, or even $60k, i would have a down payment on a decent house, were, even 1/3 of the price of it, easily... instead, i blew through it while moving to the new country and paying a year worth of rent plus a couple of work laptops for both me and my wife.&amp;#x200b;this part of my life will always be a crazy memory to keep, and share with future friends i may make, so i felt like sharing it here as i have been watching the sub for a while, though i just lurk. [removed] i remember in 2017 there were epic stories of people making fortunes from free crypto-giveaways  for example, the nano faucet gave people fantastic wealth if they held on all year. then there were things like the various bitcoin forks  great if you cashed in.now in 2020 there seems to be another uptrend in terms of the ability to get free crypto  in various ways. overtime this can build up to quite a lot.this year i have:1. coinbase earn  ive done almost all of these and have had a few referrals. i think i earned maybe $200 or so all up, cashed in btc, and that btc is probably around $4002. reddit moons  i have earned 3100 moons, sold for roughly $2203. uniswap  my free 400 tokens are still held, so they are worth maybe $12004. binance coin  lots of staking and lottery compensation payments here  for example, i recently sold my flamingo, venus and alpha tokens  maybe $30;5. hex  yes i know its a scam, but i think i bit have a decent little payout in a month when my 90% locked tokens open (wont say how much as that will reveal my btc wallet holdings);6. swissborg  a fun little guess the bitcoin app that has $50 worth of tokens in it now;7. brave browser  ive earned like $20 from that this year (insert: its not much but its honest work gif);8. uniswap pools etc  hard to calculate this one but im earning some really great fees and uni from pooling wbtc and weth  about 0.5% return a week. was also previously staking uni / eth - i made $1000 in fees but mostly gobbled up by impermanent loss.9. honeyswap  every 48 hours, i log-in to get free honey from the faucet  around $40 or so;10. survey  i did a phone survey for a local project and got given $100 of free tokens;11. livepeer  no idea what this is but i sold two airdrops for around $20;12. nexus mutual  probably the king here. invested $1200 worth. received a 58% dividend on the first day of staking (say $700) which i reinvested. that $700 is now $8000 or something ridiculous (and itself earning rewards), plus another 13 nxm (so another $416 on top).13. and then lots of rats and mice rewards from things like staking celsius, staking tezos referral rewards etc. i even have 3000 of that damn pi coin thing but dont know where that is going.14. and to top it off a free ledger nano for participation in a private group on fbso for some people that might be considered a decent pay package for a full time job! what other opportunities do you guys have where you have passive income coming from crypto?  am i missing any obvious ones here? i remember in 2017 there were epic stories of people making fortunes from free crypto-giveaways  for example, the nano faucet gave people fantastic wealth if they held on all year. then there were things like the various bitcoin forks  great if you cashed in.now in 2020 there seems to be another uptrend in terms of the ability to get free crypto  in various ways. overtime this can build up to quite a lot.this year i have:1) coinbase earn  ive done almost all of these and have had a few referrals. i think i earned maybe $200 or so all up, cashed in btc, and that btc is probably around $4002) reddit moons  i have earned 3100 moons, sold for roughly $2203) uniswap  my free 400 tokens are still held, so they are worth maybe $12004) binance coin  lots of staking and lottery compensation payments here  for example, i recently sold my flamingo, venus and alpha tokens  maybe $30;5) hex  yes i know its a scam, but i think i bit have a decent little payout in a month when my 90% locked tokens open (wont say how much as that will reveal my btc wallet holdings);6) swissborg  a fun little guess the bitcoin app that has $50 worth of tokens in it now;7) brave browser  ive earned like $20 from that this year (insert: its not much but its honest work gif);8) uniswap pools etc  hard to calculate this one but im earning some really great fees and uni from pooling wbtc and weth  about 0.5% return a week.  was also previously staking uni / eth - i made $1000 in fees but mostly gobbled up by impermanent loss.9) honeyswap  every 48 hours, i log-in to get free honey from the faucet  around $40 or so;10) survey  i did a phone survey for a local project and got given $100 of free tokens;11) livepeer  no idea what this is but i sold two airdrops for around $20;12) nexus mutual  probably the king here. invested $1200 worth. received a 58% dividend on the first day of staking (say $700) which i reinvested. that $700 is now $8000 or something ridiculous (and itself earning rewards), plus another 13 nxm (so another $416 on top).13) and then lots of rats and mice rewards from things like staking celsius, staking tezos referral rewards etc. i even have 3000 of that damn pi coin thing but dont know where that is going.so for some people that might be considered a decent pay package for a full time job! what other opportunities do you guys have where you have passive income coming from crypto? [removed] i started contract work and want to create a mini-game for my cybersecurity team for when i leave.first thing is giving them a challenge coin that will have binary code thatll lead to a url, and starting to plan the rest right now.i would love to include some blockchain technology concepts in it, and would like to hear any ideas on how to go about this. [removed] [removed] i'm trying to wrap my head around crypto and figure out what coins run what protocols and what that means.  could someone explain all of this to me like i'm 5.e.g what are the differences between btc, ethereum and defi tokens? website is: [xeth.finance](https://xeth.finance/)staking in a week or two, date was last friday, but they wanted to polish it a bit more. announcements will be made tomorrow so could be earlier.i got downvoted a month ago, so here we are 4 weeks later. the developers have not rugged, they have actually time and time again gone above and beyond. first week a large investor was hacked (some sort of virus confirmed) and they replaced his investment. the one day rebase did not work on time due to an update error? xeth sarah paid out of her pocket to airdrop our rebases, something like 17 eth it cost her.i talked about the devs first because right now the biggest issue is trust, and rug pulls. the dev tokens wallet is locked for 60 more days minimum. they burnt 70% of their dev wallet because it was in the best interest of the coin long term.the basicsxeth is pegged to 0.01 x eth so its initial cost when listing was 3.80$ or so. anytime we are over the peg? we get a daily positive rebase. the first few weeks we were getting 40%!!! +. the average over the last seven days alone has been over 50% combined. so if you bought in last week with 1,000$, you would have 1500$ now without investing anything else. there are no negative rebases, so you will never wake up to less tokens. if we get to the peg or below? the taxes for selling (currently 7.5%, but will go down to 3%) get burnt, causing the supply to go down and the price to go back up to peg. every transaction burns tokens, this is to balance the rebases. the team has been very transparent and vocal when messing with the formula they use. its is still being tweaked but the idea is to get a steady coin that is netting people 1-3% daily rewards in the short term, and 1% in the very long term. thats 1 % daily on your investment. they want to eventually button it all up and give it over to the community.whats 1% of 100,000$, 1,000$ right? a day....right now its early so we are averaging around 10%/day. a day one investor who put in 8,000$? he got an 8,000$ rebase yesterday, and he is now set for life. im also a day one investor but i only had 1 eth to spare as im on fixed income, its now worth almost 10,000$. the next few months will be full of rebases that are well above what the norm will be when the coin matures.the time to get in is now. i don't get anything out of you investing, just wanted to share my amazing experience. our market cap has jumped to 20 million in the past two weeks, and we fully expect to hit 100 million and be a top 200 coin.if you're not 100% convinced? put in 1 eth and leave it there for a week, you let me know what it looks like the following week ;)if you have any questions ill try to answer, but more technical questions are better suited to asking the devs themselves in telegram. the links are all there if you wanna click em, if not no worries. were not a chad coin, or a pump and dump, or full of xxx gifs and racist comments. we as a community want to develop a new investment mechanism for the future, crypto is the new stock market, were trying to be pioneers. come join us.chart to save you time[https://chartex.pro/?symbol=uniswap:xeth&amp;theme=dark](https://chartex.pro/?symbol=uniswap:xeth&amp;theme=dark)&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/rryheiw8qis51.jpg?width=591&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb8362f2810d95111dd46444041efe4f60346480 hey folks,currently i am conducting some research comparing traditional assets(equity, bonds, etc.) with crypto assets.so what types of crypoassets should i consider? the obvious choice are currency and i am also including crypto lending as a form of asset. what other assets should i know about? bitcoin is on track to separate money from state.  but this is happening at the cost of losing the freedom of cash forever.  every transaction ever made recorded forever, the minute the feds crack monero. i only looked at monero recently.someone who knows monero ? we know monero has hard forked quickly before, to stay private?  does the monero team have a fighting chance of preserving true fungibility and privacy?  or is that part of crypto freedom gone and we have to be happy just that the state cant print money?

[removed] [removed] while this subreddit is called /r/cryptocurrency, we obviously talk about a lot of other functions of crypto*coins* than the currency aspect. id however like to have a discussion on what the best cryptocurrency is that we currently have, and would love to hear your arguments why. the way i see it, there are a few important aspects of a *crypto*currency, as also delineated by satoshi nakamoto (1 and 2) while there are also aspects of a currency in general that must be satisfied (3 and 4).1. to be a cryptocurrency it has to be decentralised, to rely on cryptographic proof rather than trust. if there is one entity validating the transactions of a cryptocurrency, it can hardly be called a cryptocurrency. source: [bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)2. the value of it must not be pegged to a fiat currency. a centralised cryptocurrency, one whose value is determined by a central authority (such as tether), is a contradiction in terminis. source: [satoshi nakamoto](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source)3. transferability. this is an obvious point, but an important one. being transferrable is on the one hand a clear-cut definition, but is on the other hand a scale rather than an absolute yes or no. ceteris paribus, the lower the barrier is to transacting in a currency, the higher the potential velocity of money is. i would say this actually consists of a few sub-categories: transaction speed, transaction cost, ease of use and acceptance of the currency.4. scalability. another obvious one: if a cryptocurrency can only do one transaction per hour, it's never going to be useful as a broadly used currency.my question to you is: what cryptocurrency do you think best fits the definition of the ultimate cryptocurrency, and why? are there aspects of being a currency that i missed that you feel are important to have for a currency? do you think any cryptocurrency at all is able to act as a currency for a full country, let alone for the entire world? do you feel like we'll never be able to get a decentralised currency anyway?

[removed] [removed] hello. i looked in the community info section but did not find anything. im after some advice on wallets.ive read through some posts regarding wallets. im wondering if any could give me a pointer to a good info on wallets.i only have an iphone/ipad to use. can i use these wallets through my ipad with a connector? i have a ipad pro with usb c connector so i can get an adapter to connect usb devises.i use a wallet on my phone, it it a simple case of moving my currency from the app to an external wallet? do i have to download extra software to use these external wallets etc?im very new to crypto and putting my left over money in teach month into crypto so it started to mount up so id rather start the ball rolling with the best security i can early.ive been looking at the ledger nano?? no one gave a sufficient answer yet. but it is a pretty big name with an important role in the neo economy. that (couple of days it is known) deleted everything neo related.still no official word yet. but in a fast moving market fast response is necessary.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] there have been several times when i put in a large order for a set amount of coins. i assume the fee and understand what i will get after its done.but for some reason they have started taking single purchases and splitting them up on their exchange. while this isn't a huge deal at first glace. they are charging each separate transaction they split with extra fees and gas on each transaction. i dont think its adding up.so i am wondering if the system automates this to get the rates at which you asked where the coins are available...again that's fine but again multiple transaction cause more fees and gas, at very least give us the option to split the purchases ourselves (or even a disclaimer). i am still trying to figure out if by them doing this means we pay more in the long scheme of things, but its happened to me several times where i have 1 order for say 100 uni. they split that into 3 charging fees and gas etc. this seems to me like they are attempting to make extra money on the transactions if the fee rates and gas is the same for all. and when this happens i always feel i end up with far less than the listed sell prices they show.i contacted them they said they didn't know what i was talking about when i provided the account details and transactions. i love binance dont get me wrong. but to me this seem sort of disingenuous if what i think is happening is tree.wondering if i lost $16 dollars on that transaction or if maybe i was charged the equivalent divided by number of purchases.it just all seems really odd to me. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] you know the memes...6.15 bitcoin, citadels, etc.i wonder what the big boys think of those things. do they care? do they think the 6.15 thing is just nonsense? are they the ones who come up with these things in the first place?......as for the second question, does it seem like most whales will always be whales or at some point will most bitcoin be dispersed amongst a larger portion of the population?

[removed] tl;dr libya is a cash-only society, where every merchant only deals in cash. there is no electronic banking system of debit cards, credit cards, or interac machines -- just cash. but the banks ran out of cash. so, people can't buy anything because they can't access their funds because, remember, banks ran out of cash. bitcoin would seem to solve every problem. how do we get bitcoin into libya?hey everyone,first of all, full disclosure, i know very little about bitcoin, or cryptocurrency in general, so as i make this post, please forgive any ignorance.as a libyan, we're seeing numerous challenges in our banking system in libya (which, in all fairness, is just one of, many other, larger political issues if you happen to have been following middle eastern/libyan news for the last decade).the central bank of libya has not had cash for an exceedingly long period of time, post 2011, which is problematic because libya is a cash-only society. every transaction, be it a house, or a loaf of bread, has always ever been transacted in cash only. while people do have bank accounts, with your account balance merely printed on paper, there has never been debit or credit cards in libya. the only way one can access their funds from their bank account is by physically going to the bank and withdrawing cash. this is still the case today and, as you might have imagined, people have already long flooded the banks, and have depleted them of their reserves.consequently, the majority of libyans have no access to their money in their accounts, and have only been at the mercy of when banks re-supply their reserves. in an attempt at maximizing the opportunity at every libyan getting \*some\* cash, of course the bank imposes a depressingly low withdraw limit per person, who are all waiting in line-ups that are literally days long. naturally, the bank's small reserve is instantaneously depleted, again and again, and if you were not of the lucky few to retrieve cash, then you go home with your tail between your legs and hope for a better next time.the obvious solution to this would have been for the "government" to simply deploy an electronic system wherein libya catches up to 21st century's earth-shattering technology: debit and credit cards, and interac machines! needless to say, this has not been done, yet, and we can very strongly assume that the "government" has no interest in doing this. i will not get into politics, or conspiracy here, but much of it leans in that direction. (note: i put "government" in quotes because what i really mean is libya doesn't exactly have a government, and the decision-makers are, essentially, foreign intelligence via domestic militia groups).with all of that said, enter bitcoin and my questions to the problems i wish to ask and wonder if bitcoin solves:(1) the first problem we have, of course, is that people are limited to cash to purchase food. however, if every merchant simply accepted bitcoin, people can simply pay with their phones, without the need for cash. everybody, and their grandmother, has a smartphone or two. am i missing something here, or am i correct with the ease of use?(2) the second problem we have is that nobody in libya can be transferred money, from outside of libya, even if libyans had international friends and family willing to help them with money. but, with bitcoin, you can simply transfer funds online with relative ease. am i correct here, as well?(3) i have no idea whether or not bitcoin is currently available in libya; furthermore, i have no idea whether or not bitcoin is legal in libya (and, frankly, if the aforementioned problems can be solved, nobody will care about its "legality"). so, can bitcoin be adopted in libya, with relative ease, without necessitating the banking system or government? or would this undertaking be a major project?if possible, i would be very interested in working with anyone who can help make this a reality in all of libya. i'm willing to do what's needed to be done (within my capabilities, of course), be it aggressive marketing/advertising, or otherwise. thoughts, suggestions, help!thank you everyone for your help and for putting up with my rant. cheers.

would it require setting up a brand new wallet each time? i've created a transaction validation program to sanity check btc transactions before and after signing. below is the description of the overall protocol for doing a btc withdrawal from a wallet. the program does validation for steps #2 and #4.  step #2 is designed to validate that electrum is not compromised and is not generating malicious transactions. #step 4 is designed to validate that the hw wallet is not compromised and is not generating malicious transactions.part of what it does is to identify whether addresses involved in the transactions are yours or not yours, and whether they are receive or change addresses, based on a set of named xpub keys that you put into a local config file, to prevent change address attacks and other attacks, and to just ensure you didn't accidentally choose the wrong address.the program does not touch any private keys, only hd wallet master pub keys (xpub, zpub)trust minimized withdrawal protocol:\#1. generate candidate transaction in electrum watch-only wallet, save as psbt.**#2. validator, unsigned tx. - load psbt into validator. verify tx details (inputs, outputs, addresses, fee, amounts). identify wallet ownership of any addresses involved in the tx (e.g. to validate that the change address actually belongs to your wallet). display sha256 of psbt file contents. if all looks good, validator will copy the psbt to the sd for signing. this step protects against a compromised version of electrum generating a malicious transaction, and ensures only validated transactions come in contact with signing device.**\#3. hw wallet. verify sha256 hashes of psbt file from validator and as generated on hw device to ensure this psbt is the same as the psbt validated in step #2. verify tx details. if good, sign psbt.  take note of signed tx file sha256 hash.**#4. validator, signed tx. verify signed tx file sha256 hash matches hw device to ensure data integrity in transit. re-verify tx details (inputs, outputs, addresses, fee, amounts), to protect against a compromised hw wallet firmware generating malicious transactions. if validation looks ok, validator will send tx bytes to full node for broadcasting.**&amp;#x200b;any suggestions on validation steps to add, or more parts of the process to automate?

hi,if you are looking for a way to make some quick money, you're in luck!i'll pay you **$150** if you are willing to open an account in one of the brokers that i'll give you,and another **$200** in anther broker (this one is for uk citizens only),and also you can repeat this process for your friends and family and make a fortune.easy as that.&amp;#x200b;rule #1: after you open an account, you have to invest at least $250 or more on bitcoin so i can pay you. after a while, you can withdraw your investment if you want.rule #2: you must live in one of these countries: australia, new zealand, uk, singapore, hong kong, ireland, malesia, or south africa.&amp;#x200b;if you are interested, just send me a message.let me know if you have any questions.you won't find any offer better than this.good luck. i tried doing my first ever bitcoin purchase using my credit card.i uploaded everything on [bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com) app in the app store.i uploaded  a selfie and a pic of my passport but it doesn't seem to receive it.is there a work around on it?

[removed] [removed] i've been waiting for a month for some cash to land in my checking account and am suffering over the fact that i've missed the dip over the last few weeks. i was planning to put it all int btc and just let it go but as i've been waiting and reading more, i'm now thinking my best shot could be to put it into eth and trade for btc when/if the eth/btc ratio improves. the ratio is currently at \~.033 eth / btc. the ratio most recently saw 0.1 eth/btc in feb 2018, so nearly 3 yeas ago.do people think it's probably/possible/unlikely that the ratio will come close to 0.1 eth/btc again, in maybe the next 12-months? honestly feels like a longshot to me, as i'm expecting btc to 8x by the end of 2021. if that's the case, eth would have to possibly \~28x at some point in the same period.

[removed] [removed] rather than selling, investors can use their cryptocurrencies as collateral towards a cryptocurrency backed loan. this allows them to maintain ownership of their funds while gaining access to the usd they need to fund their projects.anyone ever thought about doing this so you dont have to sell all your coins to make a big life purchase? [removed] hey guys i still got some bch from 2016 is there an exchange where i can transfer them to to split them into bch(or bchabc or what its called) and bchsv? i know about the desktop app but i would rather just have the convenience of an exchange doing it for me if that works.also bonus question, in november bch is splitting again right? so i would also get equal amounts of bcha and  bchn then?&amp;#x200b;thanks for your help. [removed] i'm sure everyone is well aware of them but if not and you have a dormant account, you can do some of their learning courses on various currencies i.e. xlm and you will receive free tokens.there are 4 available and the reward currently equates to $25. it's not alot but it's essentially free money and you can attempt the question multiple times.$25 is not to be sniffed at during covid and its takes 10 mins. my friend just told me about a new token called core (offered by c/vault.finance) that was only introduced a little over a week ago and has gone from $60 up to almost $5k already. my understanding is that it is a "liquidity pool" and your principal investment is locked in and can't be returned to prevent farming (?) but that you get residual income for life. he also made a big point of the fact that only 10k of the tokens will ever exist.i am not sure what i'm asking beyond looking for someone who can explain this to a layman. sorry if this has been asked before, i just learned thanks to a post in this sub what the difference is between cold wallets, hot wallets and exchanges.my main concern is for security, i am holding in crypto.com/exchange but dont know if i should maybe change platform.i like to sell and buy according to my needs at the time and also to make some profit sometimes, so im guessing neither of the wallets would be good for me.thanks in advance so there are a good handful of articles about how to send your moons from ur reddit account vault to metamask to sell, right, but i don't see much about sending moons from metamask to a reddit account vault. like what if i wanted to buy moons on honeyswap and then send the newly-purchased moons to my vault for keeping? anybody know if this can be done and/or how?.. i don't even see a way to find a receiving address for moons anywhere in the vault so it doesn't seem possible rn. [removed] if we look over historical data on coinmarketcap:bitcoin 2013 ath occurred approximately december 04, 2013 at around $1,150.00bitcoin had an enormous wick down to below $180 on jan 14, 2015, -85.4% from ath, around 12.5 months after ath.after recovery seemed guaranteed, bitcoin had another enormous wick down on aug 24, 2015 to just below $200.00, around 19 months after ath.bitcoin hit a second ath almost exactly 4 years after the 2013 ath, on dec 17, 2017 at around $20,000. (100x from 2015 lows).the low was hit almost exactly a year later, around $3200.00 on december 15, 2018, 84% down from ath.now, this is where things get strange. i think a lot of whales were trying to frontrun the bull cycle, so they bought up a lot causing bitcoin to spike to 12k, dump, recover, and the second higher low occurred due to the covid black swan, some exchanges wicking as low as $3800 on mar 12, 2020, about 27 months after ath. if not for the 2019 front running, i believe this low would have been inevitable and would have occurred around the same time in the cycle as the 2013 cycle. now that things have calmed down, let's see where we are in the cycle vs where we were in 2013.on october 12, 2016, btc was $637.78, 55.5% of the way back to its all time high. it slightly broke its all time high on jan 4, 2017 before being strongly rejected, then it broke it again a month later before being rejected and finally on april 6th, 2017 it broke $1150 for the last time before the wild 20x to new, historical all time highs.on october 12, 2020, btc is $11,659.00, exactly 58% of the way back to its all time high. we are at exactly the same distance from ath as we were in 2016. aside from outliers such as 2019 front running and covid crash, the cycle is exactly the same and if you were to trace the 2013 cycle on top of the 2017 cycle, we would be at about the same point.i strongly believe we will be close to 20k at some point around december-january, get rejected for a few months, and then move onto new and historical highs.i hedl throughout the 2017 bear market as i was introduced to crypto in mid 2017, just before subsequently making and losing more money than ive ever seen in my life. i've been dcaing into alts and btc for 3 years. if i've learned one thing, its the further you can see into the past, the further you can see into the future. btc cycles are not lengthening. my plan is to cash out 80% of my holdings, staggered at the peak sometime between november and february of 2021-2022 and then buy back in exactly 1 year later. i will keep 20% in btc, xmr, eth only in case of a black swan event such as hyperinflation while keeping my cash (taxes paid) on the sidelines waiting for the inevitable low around 1 year after the next all time high.i am a believer of the 4 year cycle and there is nowhere near enough money in crypto to prevent it from happening again, at least one more cycle.tell me your thoughts in the comments. who else has this strategy? if we time it right, we could all retire young. i have more money in crypto than ive ever had in my life and i just pretend it doesnt exist. crypto is the only way i see in this crazy world with fractional reserve banking and money printing on a whim for young people to have the opportunity to get out of a life of wage slaving and enjoy the prosperity our ancestors enjoyed.good luck to all! the request is more or less self-explanatory. i need a conversion tool that i can plug dates and times into as well as the amount of coin or fiat i'm trying to convert. i need it to be able to tell me how much the contents of my wallet was on a given day and time. or how much a transaction was worth at the time that it was sent. these must exist, and yes, i've googled for them, but i never find exactly what i'm looking for. i figured reddit probably knows.the other half of the title is kinda vague, but i'm not sure how to phrase the problem..or if there even is a problem, or if i'm just ignorant as hell, which is a possibility i'm more than willing to allow for. lemme explain:i sent someone money this morning and what i sent vs what they received were drastically different. we were both using the same wallet/exchange service that claims to not cost anything to send between users within the service, minus the modest transaction fee of like, i dunno, 10 cents or something. the difference was way more than a few cents.for instance, i sent a friend 11.88 xmr this morning. he only received 11.55. we didn't notice it at first, and he forwarded it on to a third party who informed him he was short, as  she had only received 11.24 and change.i'm not sure if you're all aware of this, but monero's value has increased by like $25 just this weekend. cool, right?sure it is, but not at all the point, which is that 11.88 xmr is roughly $1,582 but 11.55 is only $1,538. and 11.24 is $1,497. so to transfer coin from point a to point c, all within a service which is supposedly free to send within that service, ended up costing us like $85 somehow? and legit, guys, i'm not sure how or why....once i realized that, i went looking through my transaction history. there's similar discrepancies relating to actual exchanges, where i've traded bitcoin for monero or vice versa, but the value of what i traded is greater than the value of what i traded it for. by quite a bit.for instance, i had 0.14196176 bitcoin (worth $1,641 when i noticed it) that i exchanged for 11.8424500192 monero (worth $1,566 when i noticed it). so like...where the hell is the other $75?again, this service advertises the lack of hidden fees and the free exchange of coins. transaction fees are minimal, like 0.005 or something. withdrawl fees also. i use it for the exact reason that one of the third party exchange services that edge wallet uses fucked me out of like $50 the one time that i used them, and the chunk of money being exchanged was way more than this was today. what *really* aggravates me about the situation is that i'm a fairly consistent donor to this service for the express reason that they've (supposedly) saved me so much money and so many headaches. i'm pretty outraged about it honestly.having said that, i'm aware that i don't know what i don't know. i have a (polite) email drafted to the support staff of the service, but before i send it, i was really hoping that someone much more experienced with and educated on cryptocurrencies/trading/exchanges/etc might be able to give me a crash course on why i effectively lost $165 by using a service for it's intended purpose, or who i need to bitch at to get it back. (i'm just kidding. i'm perfectly aware that it's never getting refunded. because why would it?)basically any information or considerations at all that i should be aware of or just insights that might be in any way helpful would be really appreciated.thanks guys! -today's crypto of the day is aergo, and it's current price is $0.0427.-since 2/18/20, every day i have featured a new crypto of the day for us to discuss. i try to make follow up posts within a week, but i am behind at the moment. i try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. sometimes i even feature projects i personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. i feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. at this point, i plan to try to continue making these posts until i have completed a full year.-if you decide to reply, please add something more than, "scam" or "this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020". please say why. if it is a scam, link or show evidence. if you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? it seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags.-i strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. there is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. you may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. i know i certainly did!https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/search?q=author%3ajoenorwood77&amp;restrict_sr=on-these posts are not meant to be financial advice, but instead to be an educational discussion. everyone is responsible for doing their own research.

[removed] so i've been looking at the difference between the transaction fees, exchanges usually charge and also the default transaction fees of some wallets, and for example i easily was able to get the first confirmation on bitcoin transactions in 20 minutes with fees around 0.000002 btc, while multiple exchanges charge you 0.0005 btc for having your transactions confirmed between the same time. plus i also noted wallets suggesting far more expensive fees than necessary, so i suspect a lot of people are just blindly accepting these fees and artificially inflating fees, and exchanges are probably too concerned with reflecting the transactions asap, while they could give the option to adjust the fee to their clients that are willing to wait.what do you think? are we artificially inflating transaction fees by not optimizing the way those are usually set?

[removed] another day, another 10,000 btc bought by a large firm. a few more days like this and a very big rally will be underway.the dollar is set to depreciate. traditional assets are mostly overbought. the ocean of newly printed money sloshing around the economy has to go somewhere. some of it is being used to buy btc. any company/family office/investment fund that wants to own 0.1% (~10,000 btc) of the available asset had better get on with it - the race is on. and if a sovereign starts buying...anyone with spare cash needs to cover this incredible possibility by making btc 1% of their portfolio. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] as a big fan of brave browser, i convinced my girlfriend to start using it. shes not into crypto (yet) and she didnt want to create a kyc account. with her consent, i activated brave rewards, tried to link her computer's brave browser with my uphold account (which was already synced to my computer's brave browser) and it worked!i now earn around 2x more bat, so approximately 3$/month.seems small, but imagine you convince 4 friends to better protect their privacy and in turn earn 6$/month, thats 72$ every year. 72$ you can use to stack more crypto! looking forward to convincing more friends and family members to start using brave :)extra tip:if you want to send your bat from uphold to an external address and avoid the 6 bat fee:1. use upholds new version ([wallet.uphold.com](https://wallet.uphold.com))2. use the right panel and input the amount of bat you want to send3. in the field to select ripple network (under "cryptocurrency networks" not under "cryptocurrencies"!)you probably loose a tiny bit due to exchanging your bat to ripple on uphold, but it might be of interest for some of you guys since the fees are ridiculously low (0,001 bat). [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] https://roadmap.iota.org/so as it stands now:- this year we'll see chrysalis pt2, with the first tests coming end this month (so people have time to convert to the new apis) (q4 2020)- pollen testnet is already live. the last coordicide modules are being developed as we speak (mainly mana) using the goshimmer node. this testnet will run till end of year. (2020)- nectar will launch later this year, which is incentivized testing and trying to find bugs in the coordicide solution. (q4 2020, q1 2021)- in the meantime there will be a chrysalis pt3 which will bring colored coins/digital assets. (probably q1 2021?), and who knows, also smart contracts.- honey will be the last testnet with final coordicide modules (q1-q2, 2021).- coordicide probably q3 2021goshimmer: coordicide testnet node based on go.hornet: mainnet node based on go.bee: mainnet node based on rust.goshimmer/hornet share some code. it's likely that hornet and bee will implement all chrysalis changes, and that they will also implement the coordicide modules ultimately.iota can be considered 'production ready' after chrysalis pt2 (binary + utxo) in terms of supported tps, and the api won't change that much after coordicide. companies that demand total decentralization have to wait till coordicide, others can already start deploying apps on iota mainnet later this year. honestly, im really new to all this and dont know the patterns or what makes a coin successful yet.  im still working on improving my knowledge.  but i only started looking at these things saturday.but i am really curious what you guys that have been doing this longer think about the moons. [removed] right now it's not possible to withdraw money. not even in the bank itself. all the systems are completely offline. no transfers, no withdrawals no deposits.just a reminder that this can happen with any bank and you can lose access to your funds when you need them the most.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] so as i keep investing in bitcoin, i realized the time to purchase a wallet has come, but i don't know much about them.i've seen ledger and trezor models recommended loads of times and amazon has a nice discount on them atm. wich models would you recommend and why? any specific ones i should avoid?want to leave my btc and eth in a safe place, even tho it isn't much, i would hate to lose it lol [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] for the argument crypto is less liquid than cash, wouldnt you say that cryptocurrency (or at least some) is just as liquid as cash? thats one of the driving goals behind lightning network in the bitcoin camp to create a viable layer 2 solution to transact bitcoin at better intervals. or same with the emergence of ethereum 2.0 releases.i understand people have to sell off their coins in order to purchase things, but isnt the eventual point for using crypto is that youll never really need to do that if businesses, and other services started to accept crypto currency as a viable form of payment? people will claim market is too volatile, but within these markets, stable coins offer an solution to that concern as they do not change in value so they can be a viable use of commerce. maybe not the ones like we have today (dai, usdt, or usdc) but maybe government issued ones. hopefully along with those new coins better regulatory classifications will follow.tokenomics becoming more popular with the emergence of defi systems, and nfts. from what i seen, cryptocurrency could make assets that werent as liquid, become even more liquid. just have to get creative with how you structure this.this is just a thought i had, i want to know you all thoughts. we are far from the world using some cryptocurrencies as medium of exchange. from the covid pandemic, to the usa federal reserve reduced distribution of physical coins, its promoting a lot pf businesses to go cashless. even fintech companies are providing better liquidity solutions for liquidation of assets. appending cryptocurrency and blockchain technology would just accelerate these application performance.akon city certainly pushing forth the dream of crypto ran only economy. we always hear success stories about making money of crypto but very less people share their stories about how they lost money. as a beginner, i know i'm gonna make mistakes along the way but some stories might help us going out of track.

[removed] a node adds a transaction to the blockchain, and when enough other nodes validate and also add the transaction, it becomes official.do smart contracts work similarly? that is, one node runs the contract and adds the result to the blockchain. other nodes also run the contract, and if they get the same result, they also add it to the blockchain. so the contract runs multiple times, perhaps even many times.by "run the contract" i mean run a particular bit of code; code that has presumably already made "official" on the blockchain. and run with specified inputs.

[removed] i am working on [arcane arcade](http://staging.arcanearcade.io/), an online store where you can buy video games with bitcoin (or monero). for developers, they get their payment directly to their coin wallets. they provide steam keys or direct download of their installers.i'm looking at a halloween launch, and i want to get it in front of everyone i can.check it out, tear it to shreds. even if you don't chek it out, share your thoughts - would you buy games with bitcoin over using fiat? i think a lot of the community and no offense.. are a bit nerdy and i think you underestimate the imagination of the public. pay people to paint the picture of the future like they do with apartment complex models to sell to contractors. incentivise artists to make memes or design anything that illustrates the kind of vision you're projecting. it's like before the moon landing they needed science fiction to enhance the kind of enthusiasm to the public. i see 200,000 programming jobs for blockchain paying big bucks up front but theres absolutely shit all for artists because everyone always expects artists to make them first and crowdfund using a qr code for their wallet address. to much flaccid marketing and not enough art in imo. i dont care how bitcoin rich you are they dont even accept that shit at olive garden so youre technically still broke to me **1. is it affordable?**this is an important thing to think about, dont get caught in the hype of current prices. only invest what you can afford to lose, re-mortgaging your house to invest is not a smart move!**2. research the marketplace thoroughly**if you dont know anything about the project you are investing into or the market itself, you are creating more risk. education is paramount, if you dont know anything about the market, find someone that does.**3. time horizon**equally important to understand that once you invest, it may be some time before you can access your funds. markets do not travel in a straight line, so some days you could be up and others you could be down. timing is key, if you invest during a bear market you could be waiting a while to get your money back.**4. pulling profits**you need to execute a plan for reaching goals, this should include targets that you monitor and act upon to pull regular profits during times where the market goes up. this will not only start to cover your initial investment but also help educate you on when to take action to ensure you have a good return on your investment.**5. create an emergency fund for unforeseen circumstances**there could not be a more uncertain time in peoples lives than right now. jobs are at risk with lots of business closures as a result of covid-19 and lockdown. we cannot look into the future but we can prepare for it. try and get completely debt free and at least 3 months ahead for living expenses before choosing to invest. this gives you a cushion for some time if you lose your job and need to search for a new one.**6. risk vs reward**the [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cryptocurrency) market is extremely volatile, this means that the risk vs reward is extremely high. there are over 5500 [coins/tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cryptocurrencies) you can choose to invest into. some are established projects that are changing the world and could become the new major players in town further down the line. many of them are not, history teaches us that sometimes a fantastic idea can also be destroyed in seconds by a slightly better idea. this happens a great deal in this market, without educating yourself and following industry news, you can easily get caught out and lose money. research and understand the projects, look into the team behind them, their activity and engagement online, their whitepaper and see what partnerships they have.if you have helpful advice to add, please feel free to comment.if you found these tips helpful and want more helpful tips on cryptocurrency, download our [free e-book cryptocurrency explained](https://wecoachcrypto.com/free-book). you can subscribe to our monthly newsletter packed with helpful tips on our website [https://wecoachcrypto.com](https://wecoachcrypto.com/)follow us on facebook, instagram, linkedin and twitter using @wecoachcrypto a friend keeps telling me to hold my bitcoin here and earn interest on my coins although im getting real bit connect vibes from have someone else hold my seeds just curious on what the community thinks about block fi 8.4% interest seems to good to be true can anyone tell me if they know about or are in a telegram group called b i t c o i n   w h a l e s   p r i v a t e and if it is genuine?

[removed] many years ago, as a young lad, i mined some bitcoin. i also do a little sports forecasting with bovada ;) because of this i've always had btc hanging around and never felt like there was any good or safe way to actually f!@##%$ sell the stuff.last week i was scammed out of $500 worth of btc. i was devastated. i had actually been going through other terrible personal troubles in my life (probably why i was dumb enough to get scammed) and in one of the lowest moments of my life, some guy out there somewhere maybe even one of you, stole from me. it was awful. i've just been so desperate for a safe way to sell my btc without getting raped by uncle sam or rekt by service fees or other bullshit.what i really wanted was exactly what local coin swap offers. simply put, it's a pier to pier escrow system that lets you safely sell your btc. that's it. you recieve payouts from all sorts of methods that i could see (i just used paypal). tonight i used their system to sell what according to google is 159 dollars worth of btc to a super cool dude who was patient with me for my first trade and actually sent me $220 dollars, all while i had the safety and protection of this escrow platform.a lot of you say why not use coinbase? well their shit was intrusive signing up for an account, they wanted the last 4 of my social and to know the source of my btc? fuck off, the source is bovada and that's none of your fucking business specifically. decentralized currency shouldn't be tracked harder than paper currency that's half the point so they can f!@#$ right off.anyways. i finally did it boys, i sold some btc and i couldn't be happiertldr, i found the glory of pier to pier escrow without the government or exchanges bending me over the barrel.

UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// hey everyone, i am familiar with the stock to flow model (s2f) but i was wondering if there is another mathematical model that is worth reading, other than the s2f, that predicts such large amounts of numbers.cheers hi, i'm wondering if there's a way to buy a small amount of bitcoin using a card with no or limited kyc (for example, just a phone number and email). i'm interested in this for friction-minimizing purposes: i'm aware you can use a localcryptos or bisq-type service to buy with no kyc. i'm wondering if there's somewhere you can go to buy say 50 bucks of bitcoin and just enter your card info and a phone number and be done without having to make an account and submit id and all that. [changenow used to have this option](https://changenow.io/blog/changenow-android-app-update) but they don't anymore.thanks in advance! hi all,i have a certain amount of btc stored on my hardware wallet at home. i then have the recovery phrases stored at alternative locations (in the event my house burns down etc.)btc is now at a value where if i convert the value to dollars i would not be comfortable storing that amount of cash at home. i think this way because if someone has access to my wallet they have my cash (assuming they can breach my password).i've looked into storing it at a bank in a safety deposit box, then the paper at another bank and another paper at another location. the cost to do this is actually really reasonable. however, there is a down-side; i can't access it on weekends. i have no reasons to need to access btc quickly from the pov of my finances. but, still this isn't something i'm comfortable with.i wanted to get the opinions of people on here to help me think this through. so overall:- would you accept keeping your btc in a very secure location (essentially impossible for someone to steal them) in exchange for only being able to access them monday - friday how do i indicate what i should do a stop loss and take profit with bitcoin to intraday trade it? a certain percentage? a percentage based on volatility? i don't want my percentage to be to high or it'll never reach the target but i don't want it to be too low otherwise it will prematurely sell my stock (then i lose money a lot more than normal)note: i'm using 1:1.5 risk-reward ratio i invested in bitcoin for the first time recently. after scrolling through this page, it seems like most people own bitcoin instead of invest. so im curious about why people choose to do this.i dont plan on spending bitcoin. i live in the u.s. and i thought it seemed like a good place to invest my money. but as i scroll this page i definitely feel like an outlier. and it seems like maybe im not understanding some key aspects of bitcoin. id really appreciate an explanation or maybe a resource that helped you make the decision to buy instead of invest.also, to clarify, i invested through robinhood. which to me seemed like a perfectly fine app. but now i see people shitting on it everywhere i look. can somebody convince me why i should leave robinhood? tbh, seeing a lot of americans think they influence the market moves in btc is almost hilarious. i know it's a case of non-malicious naivete but everyone has to realise: 1) largest exchanges &amp; btc wallets are chinese 2) all key market mover mining firms are chinese 3) in number, likely more asians (korea/jp/china) trade btc than anyone else.if anything, btc tends to move inverse to dollar strength, just like other risk-on asset indices like nsdq &amp; s&amp;p. that's about the correlation you'll ever get. is there anywhere that i can purchase bitcoin with a visa gift card? if you know please comment [removed] hi [r/bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinca/)!we did a report comparing major crypto exchanges in canada, in collaboration with blockgeeks. check out the results of our analysis here!

[removed] taproot is merged, this is very nice !but it would be nicer to have the activation code in 0.21 release.would it be possible to have it for the release in december although core feature freeze is today ?i want that we send a clear message about bitcoin: once the code of a softfork on which everyone agree it should be activated is well reviewed and merged, activation process must start, we don't care about the opinion of miners or people who don't run nodes.i don't want to wait the 0.22 release to activate just because of a feature freeze. next release is a fine wait. so is it possible to backport the activation code ?thanks to core devs for the incredible work on this amazing 0.21 release !

[removed] maybe i'm doing improper calculations, but as long as you account for spread, didn't buy bitcoin when it was very cheap therefore likely having either nearly a full bitcoin or more, there's very little benefit to not pulling profit (aside from tax issues of course). of course at what percentage to pull profit would be the big question.let me know if i'm totally out to lunch. but owning less than a bitcoin and having only relatively recently bought in, it would seem to be that the percentages are so small relative to the price of bitcoin that the gains you will receive from keeping your profit in is so small, ( maybe 20-30$ per $1000 increase in the price of bitcoin) that the benefit of pulling profit when bitcoin goes back to the price you originally purchased your bitcoin at you are still at a small profit overall.other than holding bitcoin until the us dollar loses all value, why would you not remove profit? ###status of the bitcoin network as of thursday, october 15, 2020 at 12:00:01 est:**total bitcoins:** 18,517,846.044971**height:** 652,868**difficulty:** 19,298,087,186,262.609375######statistics for the past 24 hours:**number of blocks mined:** 145**total bitcoins output (amount sent):** 2,665,285.174273**total fees:** 81.446903**average time until block found:** 9 minutes, 55 seconds**estimated hashrate:** 139,100,401,956.560120 gh/s**current price:** us$11,401.29*data provided by [smartbit.com.au](https://www.smartbit.com.au). price data provided by [coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com).****^^i ^^am ^^a ^^bot. **[^^my ^^commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/3an2c4/ive_been_working_on_a_bot_for_crypto_subs_like/)** ^^| ^^*/r/crypto_bot* ^^| [^^message ^^my ^^creator](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=busterroni) ^^| [^^source ^^code](https://github.com/busterroni/crypto_bot) [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/15/2093860/0/en/dxone-launches-next-generation-crypto-trading-and-research-platform.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/15/2093860/0/en/dxone-launches-next-generation-crypto-trading-and-research-platform.html) simply bitcoin, a channel that breaks down all the daily bitcoin news. from twitter to important updates to cringy daily fails we have it all[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv\_jenqwoba&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv_jenqwoba&amp;feature=youtu.be) we had our quarterly personal finance training day at work today. we had various financial advisors talk to us about budgeting, investing, etc. they did not mention anything about the current state of the dollar and how its losing value daily, nor did they mention bitcoin. they gave the generic invest in bonds, stocks, and savings accounts. im not surprised by this, instead i am very sad and confused. when will people come to realization? i saw they are making a movie about the onecoin scandal, which i think could be good for just getting people aware of the crypto world, be it a story about fraud.  has bitcoin been represented in anything on film or television that isn't a documentary? i've been reiterating some thoughts on bitcoin in the future.when the block reward reduces to a point where miners need to profit from transaction fees, will this be enough incentive to keep operations running, considering the costs involved to maintain the current hash rate? 7tps is also a constraint on income.if we assume the above concern works out for the first layer functioning in standalone, the question regarding the ln arises:if the ln becomes the main layer for performing transactions in the future, won't this reduce the income for miners? i know node operators settle the difference in balance on the first layer, but how often will this theoretically happen?i apologise if this is a basic question already discussed, but i'm curious if someone has done some calculations before, or can refer me to a good resource discussing this topic.thanks! hey, i've recently helped a small charity i work at set up a wallet so they can accept bitcoin donations, but the majority of their donors are older people that think bank transfers are futuristic. are there any places online or organisations that can help charities connect with the crypto community? if you do what do you do for work? hello bitcoin fanatics,currently i'm using my gpu with awesome miner, works fine.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i have noticed over the last few days that some people have fractional moons in their flair.   i didn't know we could have fractional moons.    so far it looks they only go 2 decimal points.     did anyone know what the smallest fraction of a moon we can actually have?more importantly, what do we call them?

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/curio](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/curio)[www.goldenbullcrypto.com](http://www.goldenbullcrypto.com/): these guys are using nfts to invest in whisky collections, which sounds good plus they are live on rarible, [https://app.rarible.com/goldenbull](https://app.rarible.com/goldenbull) \- they do not have a governance token though so returns are directly through the nfts.are there yet any other start-ups allowing people to invest in real estate, vintage cars, rare wine and whisky though tokenisation? if an individual wanted to invest in say, a db5 aston martin instead of tesla stock then there is a large market here i think.

[removed] im looking to diversify my reddit tokens, as my current vault is heavily weighted towards brick. what is the current ratio of trading brick for moon? apologies if this isnt the place for this, just curious if anyone else is in the same boat. [removed] [removed] cryptocurrency trading is largely unregulated. with all this big money taking significant positions in bitcoin and instantly becoming whales, what's stopping them from pumping the price of a bitcoin up to $50k, $100k, or even $1m?i'm not asking this in a critical way. i'm asking because i've been out of crypto for a while now due to financial obligations, but recently i've been imagining this massive crypto ship being built and it looks like it's about to set sail. i'm planning to buy, at the very least, 1 btc to hold for the long run. i refuse to stand on the dock and slowly wave as this ship sails off into the distance. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i am coming out with a new xdai token and i figured since transaction fees are so low i would give a bit out to anyone who posts their xdai address. this is limited to the first 100 accounts and your account must be at least 1 month old with 1000 karma. if you want to sell it feel free it will be up on honeyswap after i give away tokens to 100 people. good luck! it seems that many community members are finding it hard to understand the value behind moons right now so here is something from my own experience that should provide some helpful information for many moon holders.#immediate valueas you know, moons can be traded on honeyswap for 0.05$ (price as of post writing) right now but this is not everything you will be getting. if you jump through the hoops to bridge tokens over to the xdai network you will have a defi playground with zero fees (almost). if you are new to staking and farming this has proven to be the best place to start, at least for me. you can stake, unstake, farm with your tokens, etc with no error penalty in transaction fees. all of that without spending a single dime thanks to reddit moons.there are a few more things that you could be doing on the platform with them like converting to coins and monthly subscriptions but you already know that.#expected valuei'm pretty sure that we will see our first hype cycle right after the bakeoff winner is announced. main net news will be out and a lot of speculators will want a piece of your moons before they hit the market. this would be just one of many reasons outsiders will want to own moons. you can purchase banner space with donuts right now and the same is to be expected here but with a slight difference. /r/cryptocurrency is one of the largest crypto communities on reddit. it is also one of the biggest communities you could find online and this is very important for marketing. many projects and exchanges will want to put their name in this sub because we are their targeted audience. the higher the competition, the higher the price.another thing worth mentioning is that we aren't only a crypto-based demographic. online stores that want to increase sales could just enable moon payments and make an announcement here. more convenience would incentivize many of us to spend a few moons, probably.exchange listing will be almost immediate imo. again, the size of our community as a whole will play a key part there. we are talking about potentially bringing 20-30k new users to an exchange just because they were the first ones to list moons.#long term valuedue to the limited supply moon distribution will decrease over time and increase the price of the token in the process, if adoption does happen as expected. more users would be coming over to reddit to try and get some moons for free, in turn increasing the population numbers. again, increasing community numbers would inflate the price and the cycle would keep repeating.the bottom line is that i find moons helpful, to say the least. as for the future - a currency is only worth as much as the community behind it. i have high hopes for this one. [removed] hi guys curious to know what everyones favourite cryptocurrency is. all coins/tokens included.i'm really enjoying cardano at the moment and see that long term it could be a winner. especially with the amount of work the devs are putting in.if you could also let me know why it's your favourite that would be great. [removed] [removed] [removed] let's say every single crypto currency was pegged to the most stable/least inflationary fiat currency, would you still be as active on this whole thing? provided you wouldn't make any profit from it.for me, i initially got into crypto because i needed it as a means to receive payments, it wasn't until about a year later where i realized there was potential for making profits on crypto itself as i would always spend as much as i received, since then i have always kept both options in mind, i receive payments from some of my clients in crypto and spend it as i need, sadly i don't have as much room to keep a good portion of my money in crypto at the moment as i have a good chunk of expenses each month with a baby on the way.but thinking back to how i first used crypto; at one point i had no means to receive payments due to the country i lived in, there was no option to receive external currencies, or for parties in other countries to send payments/money, it was crypto that allowed me to continue being able to provide for my family as i could offer it as an option to clients, then i would just exchange it for local currency and spend it on necessities. today i am in a much better country, have several different payment options to offer to current and potential clients and i still love to receive crypto as payment whenever it is possible and the client is willing, personally, crypto currencies changed my life, maybe even saved it. can you feel the fil tonight? :)we can, and we are excited for people to be able to pay with it and accept it as payment!go, filecoin![https://nowpayments.io/blog/filecoin-payments-to-be-supported-asap](https://nowpayments.io/blog/filecoin-payments-to-be-supported-asap)https://preview.redd.it/9l9iwx4qj9t51.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9322e6dc954767995038cee82a6a6c1b8850df9 this is purely hypothetical of course, but let's say someone offered you a price today to buy all of the cryptocurrency you're currently holding, on the condition that you could never buy back again. you could use that money to invest in something else, like stocks, or buy property, or whatever you like other than cryptocurrency. what price (if any) would you sell for?for me it would be easy to say something like: 'i'd never sell at any price because i believe in the fundamentals so much' or 'nothing below 100x the current value', but if i really imagine being in this hypothetical situation and the money was put on the table in front of me, anything above 10x my portfolio's current price would give me real reason to consider selling. i could use that money to buy a house, which is something i currently am nowhere near being able to do. hodling may well be worth more than 10x, but a bird in hand is worth more than 2 in the bush, as they say.so, just for a bit of fun (and try to be as honest with yourself as possible), what would be your crypto sell price? hi everyone, i'm a new user and i would like to 'play' with moons.i saw that some people get moons using a 'faucet'. here is what i've done :1) i downloaded and installed firefox2) i installed the metamask extension and i created my metamask wallet3) i used the following link to get 0.2 eth on the rinkeby test network  : [rinkeby faucet](https://rinkeby.faucet.epirus.io/)4) i can see the 0.2 eth in my metamask wallet5) i went on the [xmoon exchange](https://xmoon.exchange/) and i linked my metamask to the xmoon exchange. i can see my 0.2 eth in the xmoon exchange6) then i'm stuck. i can not do anything with those eth.&amp;#x200b;how do i convert it to moons or xmoons? is it possible?&amp;#x200b;thanks for your help! [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] im curious for the people that already bought 32 eth and are planning to stack them as a validator or in a pool in november.are you not afraid of the penalties that could arise during phase zero? i read penalties for wrong voting or staying offline for a long period of time.also stacking in phase 0 means at least 1 year without access to your funds until phase 1 arrives.is the risk worth it or are you just experimenting with eth 2.0 for a future and larger investment? [removed] [removed] [deleted] bitmex, a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, was recently charged by the united states cftc with failing to prevent money laundering and failing to implement other basic compliance procedures. for those unfamiliar with bitmex: bitmex is a trading platform that offers investors access to the global financial markets using only bitcoin. bitmex is built by finance professionals with over 40 years of combined experience and offers a comprehensive api and supporting tools. gee, that doesn't sound so bad. basically, you can buy and sell bitcoin on bitmex. so what's the big deal? well, from the bitmex site: does bitmex offer leverage? yes, bitmex offers leverage on all of its products. the highest leverage bitmex offers is up to **100x leverage** on its perpetual bitcoin / usd perpetual contract. okay, but what is leveraged trading exactly? according to thebalance.com, "100:1: one-hundred-to-one leverage means that for every $1 you have in your account, you can place a trade worth up to $100. this ratio is a typical amount of leverage offered on a standard lot account. the typical $2,000 minimum deposit for a standard account would give you the ability to control $200,000."1. **and herein lies my first issue with an unregulated exchange like bitmex.** when used in the crypto-space, i think leverage is some fucked up shit. with massive amounts of leverage, whales can manipulate the price of bitcoin while little fish like you and i are at the mercy of the gods. if the whales want to move the price higher, they can coordinate a leveraged 'attack' to increase the price of bitcoin. if they want to drop the price of bitcoin, they can similarly coordinate a massive sell off. this is often visualized as those exaggerated green and red spikes on a trading chart sending the price of bitcoin through lines of resistance or support. this, in turn, can then trigger further exaggerated selloffs. additionally, inexperienced traders have little to no business trading on leveraged accounts. the vast majority of those who try will walk away in a world of pain carrying a huge loss on their shoulders. but... if some schmuck goes all in on leverage and loses their investment and goes broke, isn't that their fault? well, yes. that would be a tough pill to swallow, but technically yes, it's their fault. but rather than laugh and point at this person, shouldn't we be encouraging others to embrace cryptocurrency? i think leverage exposes all the wrong things about trading cryptocurrency, yet leverage is exactly how centralized exchanges like bitmex make their money. this leads me to my second point.2. **criminal charges against a centralized exchange facilitates the need for decentralized exchanges.** what the hell is a decentralized exchange? from wikipedia: a decentralized exchange (dex) is a cryptocurrency exchange which operates in a decentralized way, i.e., without a central authority. decentralized exchanges allow peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies. because users do not need to transfer their assets to the exchange, decentralized exchanges reduce the risk of theft from hacking of exchanges. decentralized exchanges can also prevent price manipulation or faked trading volume through wash trading, and are more anonymous than exchanges which implement know your customer requirements. i remember when i first heard about decentralized exchanges i thought to myself... this is going to be huge! but then, no one seemed to share my excitement. coinbase continued to thrive, followed by the likes of bitmex and other centralized exchanges. then, one by one, hack after hack, i finally began to see people move toward decentralized exchanges like uniswap.i mentioned in another post that we are still in the early stages of crypto development. while bitcoin has been around for over a decade, we are just now beginning to gain traction in other areas of innovation and growth. if there was ever a time to break out of the same corrupt pattern of conventional finance, now is the time!

DOWN //POSTDATACOMPILED// hey fellas,i hope youre all having a great night.ive been an avid follower of cathie wood and her ark funds for the past several years. as a result, ive had very solid gains in the stock market following her advice. she recently said a well rounded portfolio should contain at least 5% of bitcoin. heres my problem, i have none at the moment. im heavily invested in fintech companies, and arkf. essentially im investing in companies that will benefit from the rise of bitcoin. seems silly not to invest in actual bitcoin.i currently have about 100k in stock market, and roughly 20k in cash. i cant help but think my cash is just losing value sitting in the bank. ive downloaded cash app and have yet to pull the trigger on purchasing some bitcoin. this is not something i would actively trade. id buy and hold. id love to here some of your thoughts on how to approach this. buy now? wait until after the election? my risk tolerance in fairly high. i was considering just dropping 5k into bitcoin and seeing what happens... have a missed the boat? is it worth it?i appreciate your input! [removed] i wasnt able to find any information but i was wondering if anyone here works or earns fiat currency, exchanges it for bitcoin and pays rent, utilities, monthly expenses, etc with bitcoin. not sure if this is entirely possible but id be interested in learning more about the transition from fiat or bitcoin spending and how it has affected your daily life/routine.thanks! need to send someone 800usd worth of bitcoin. i sign up for coinbase, confirm to a level 3 account and am now ready to send some damn bitcoin. i deposit and theres a 7 day wait. weird because 7 days seems like a very long time, most bank transactions take significantly less time. i wait the 7 days and im ready to finally send some bitcoin. and bam hit with another 3 day wait. i needed to send someone bitcoin a week ago and now i have to wait 10+ days. f*ck coinbase i feel like they should make it clear that if you buy bitcoin, youre gonna receive it in 10+ days shipping, longer than an actual fricking tangible product. hey guyswhats the fastest way to buy onlinelike ik exchanges and stuff need id verification and stuff like thatdo u recconend any exchsnge that have this proces as fast as possible hi!i'm a new user of [crypto.com](https://crypto.com/)'s platform, i'm trying to calculate the commissions and primarily the spread in the price of bitcoin and eth...someone could give more informations about this two values?

[removed] hi guys,i'm fairly new to crypto and i usually like to do a lot of research before choosing a service or product. i just recently purchased a tiny amount of bitcoin and ethereum through independent reserve, but i haven't transferred it to a wallet yet.i've been digging through some forums in the last few days and found that coinjar and mycelium were highly recommended. it seemed to have the best reputations for security but yesterday i saw an ad for a random company called cryptospend. the ad said i could pay my bills and transfer/cash out crypto to aud in seconds (?!) when using their wallet. there doesn't seem to be any fees either. it looks like they're pretty new themselves. i saw a few positive reviews on the play store and app store but i don't see any other reviews or testimonials on actual forums. has anyone else tried cryptospend or heard of them before?i've checked out their website and socials and they seem to be legit. but i thought crypto payments took way longer than a few seconds. is this too good to be true?right now, i'm leaning towards coinjar but if cryptospend's crypto to aud conversions really are that fast, then it might be a deal breaker for me because i seriously hate waiting long. i'm eager to hear if anyone else has any input on them.  any help is greatly appreciated. thanks in advance!

links in comments [removed] [removed] [removed] i have an old account on coinbase pro. now theyre charging fees and commissions, something im not too happy about. im ready to jump ship.i heard robinhood us no fees or commissions, but someone said that robinhood may not actually own any bitcoin. is there any truth to this?thanks [removed] for those of you who don't already know there's a faucet under honeyswap that currently allows every user to claim around $3.5 in honey every 48 hours, which is around $50 monthly, claiming only takes about 10 seconds once you have verified, here are the steps:#step 1, brightid verification:the faucet currently uses a very "interesting" system to keep users from using multiple addresses to claim the reward without doing any kyc, and that system is done through one app called brightid, you:1. install this app2. set it up on your device with a name and a picture3. join what they call a "verification party", which is basically a one time discord or zoom call, here they check you are a real human by asking everyone in the call to activate their webcams, then you approve others in your call within your app as legitimate people, and if things go okay, you'll be verified within 5 minutes, some people may not be willing to show their face like this, but hey, it is $50+/month and only people who don't mind should proceed from here on:- install: https://www.brightid.org/- join a verification party, they are run daily on discord and zoom, you can check the times here: https://www.brightid.org/meet- you should appear as verified within the app#step 2, setup an xdai wallet:- open metamask, and select "custom rpc" from the network dropdown.- choose "custom rpc" settings, add in the xdai network details and click save:- network name: xdai- new rpc url: https://rpc.xdaichain.com/- chainid (optional): 100- symbol: xdai- block explorer url: https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai#step 3, get 1 xdai, you'll need it for the fees, everytime you claim hny you'll need to pay for gas, it is something like 0.00001 xdai each time- get dai (you'll need eth to pay for the gas between dai &lt;-&gt; xdai)- go to https://xdai.io/- click exchange- dai to xdai ( make sure you select dai to xdai and have metamask on mainnet, not xdai/poa network)- follow the steps to convert some dai to xdai- choose an amount (1 would suffice), then send. after you click send it may take a few minutes as it needs to confirm. be patient.- switch to the xdai/poa network#step 3, register &amp; claim hny:- https://faucet.1hive.org/#/- enable account on the top right (link metamask, make sure you are on the xdai network we set earlier)#step 4, exchange hny to xdai- either keep the hny, or exchange it to xdai at https://honeyswap.org/#/- you can check the hny price at: https://info.honeyswap.org/token/0x71850b7e9ee3f13ab46d67167341e4bdc905eef9that's it.#things to note:- personally, i am keeping everything i am claiming in hny, hny was $800 only a few days ago, and it is already $1263, i am risking nothing as i am only using what i get from the faucet, so do your own research if you actually plan on purchasing some with your own money.- if i wanted to withdraw back to dai i would wait until i had at least $50, or so (after at least a month), as mainnet eth fees are quite high at the moment, the hit would be lower percentage wise when converting if you wait until you have higher amounts of xdai. i have been spot trading a for about 2 to 3 years on binance. crypto is a big interest of mine but mostly just a hobby making small profits here and there with trading and spending time researching different projects. i am interested  to learn more about margin trading now. any suggestions on possible tutorials or courses on margin trading that are worth taking?

are we just at the beginning of it?and i also genuinely wonder, knowing that relatively few of the big ones could gobble up relatively large percentages of total supplies, is that necessarily a good thing?forgive me if i'm completely clueless and not seeing the big picture, but to me, it always seemed that it would kind of maintain a certain status quo that might not be as desirable?true wealth redistribution wasn't necessarily part of the original plan right? or should i stop thinking in those terms and realise that those investments simply legitimize btc and eth as equally valid investible assets?excuse my rambling and probably overlooking some major aspects, it just always feels a bit "double" seeing those news posts about huge amounts being bought up, i'm wondering what i'm not getting. :) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] whether you were here since silk road, or got here at the end of 2017 when even your grandma wanted to buy bitcoin, we have all had some amazing moments while being in the crypto sphere. with that in mind, what have been your favorite crypto moments? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] does anyone know if etc ever did anything about the 51% attacks they suffered a couple months back? from what i could find, all they did was have exchanges make confirmation times longer but that just seems like a temporary fix similar to putting duct tape over a hole in your muffler instead of actually welding it and fixing the problem for good. im wondering because a project i follow and am interested in is built off etc and that worries me when it comes to its long term potential. hey everyone:)i did look around to see if such games exist but i couldn't find anything like this.basically i'm looking for an rpg (not a card game) in which you purchase items and weapons for crypto. afterwards, when you don't need those items anymore, you can sell them in an open market.the existing card games running on ethereum look great but i'm looking for an actual rpg (in 2d... one can dream).thanks in advance! i wanted to share an experience i had this week thats helped me more deeply appreciate the idea of decentralization, and what can happen when a company creates a walled garden platform, but youre one that gets walled out.many of you here are probably aware that earlier this week a platform became available to swap moons directly for nano (or banano). well i took advantage of that opportunity and sold my moons. i was really happy about the whole thing, and decided to purchase a new oculus quest 2 for me and my daughter to celebrate. we were really excited to play some fun vr games this weekend! well it turns out that facebook (owner of oculus) now requires a facebook account linked to the headset for it to function.to avoid this post getting too bloated, ill add a link to my post in the oculus sub for details on what happened. but the short of it is that i was blocked from reopening my account without reason, with no recourse to get it resolved. this was a 3 day process, and left me with a $400 headset that was unusable. i returned it and thankfully was refunded without issue, but the experience was eye opening.im not trying to paint this as cause for revolution or anything, its just some video games im blocked from after all, but im imagining scenarios that could spell disaster, scenarios that are not too much of a stretch to get to. what happens if a company like facebook gets majority control over something like libra, and they get to decide who is allowed to use it. the censorship on platforms like facebook, twitter, and youtube are well documented and will likely only get worse. the more we consolidate power into these entities, the more vulnerable we become to being walled out of the garden so to speak. i wouldnt be shocked if someone didnt like something i posted 10 years ago and decided they didnt feel like letting me back on the platform. who knows.the take away for me is that while crypto isnt necessarily the answer to all these problems, it is an answer to some. most of us, myself included, came here to make money, but theres a value to these decentralized systems that goes deeper than that. this experience has given me a clearer view of that, and i wanted to give you some food for thought too. and while getting locked out from participating in a vr ecosystem isnt the threat that were all most concerned about, for me it seems to be a shadow of it at least.be safe out there my crypto friends, and have a great week. [removed] [removed] hi. i'm looking for any suggestions people might have for accepting payments via a form on my wordpress site. it's not an online store though so i'm not sure if what i'm looking for exists.i edit and produce podcasts (and sometimes video) for people, and i'd like a page on my website where they can make a crypto payment and reference their invoice number so i can easily see who has paid me and for which job.does anyone know if something like that exists as a simple plugin/widget that works with wordpress?thanks [removed] even if moons don't go much higher than now, i've seen this concern floating around and also having moons leader-board makes the top earners potentially vulnerable to hackers.i like that vault is integrated in reddit mobile, but if there was also the option to have it as a standalone wallet app that can be downloaded either on the same or different device or hardware wallet then a user can link to his reddit account while have the funds secure on an offline or other device. [removed] [removed] big crypto investments seem to becoming mainstream again with the likes of square, grayscale, microstrategy all buying in.because of this a lot of crypto must be being sold as the market is staying relatively flat.who is selling to balance the market? i always loved this subreddit with weird people who like to talk about a variety of meaningful things which most of people would define in one word, crap. few months ago moon appeared and everything became even more interesting. i think the world has never had to deal with people like here on this subreddit. is this the end of the world we know, the end of human species and the rise of the new era of cryptomaniacs? describe your vision. [removed] [removed] i am a big believer in eth and i like tezos for the governance aspect, but im hesitant about it being distinct enough from eth to dislodge or even substantively supplement eth in a meaningful way. i know there are uses in france and chatter about uses in the eu, but it seems like nothing points to a solid foundation for anything other than speculation on a rise in price in the short- to mid-term. am i missing something that tezos offers over eth? staking (pardon, baking) is easier right now, but that could be eclipsed in the next year.do you all see something i dont? is tezos a solution to eths issues, or a solution in search of a problem? another wrinkle: is the decentralization worth the transaction bottlenecking at this point in blockchain development?oh, and the hot button: is eth way too far ahead on defi?thanks for your thoughts all! serious question: as everyone is moving their btc off centralized exchanges, are there benefits to keeping it as btc, or is turning it to a btc token on ethereum (there are several, wbtc seems like the easiest to swap to) will achieve the same goal as realizing value eventually?im used to moving and swapping erc20 tokens, so im kinda biased against other chains. which is why id appreciate your opinions, explanations, and recommendations. i'll try not to go in to too much yada-yada. essentially, strongblock wish to reward node operators to incentivise sustained high-quality nodes. a lot of money has been spent on this protocol and they have an experienced (core eos) team.when v1 was released, the team wanted to attract eth and link miners to the platform and, as such, offered greater rewards and more frequent (daily) claiming of those rewards. the release wasn't as popular amongst these miners as anticipated so the rewards were super high and encouraged miners to sell their daily rewards, which they duly did. as a result, price totally queefed itself.this has enabled the developers to learn from their mistakes, and v2 is being released next week. this will prove to be a great time to enter if the protocol meets the anticipated success.[https://medium.com/@strongblockio/strongblock-defi-protocol-v2-29b7cc663345](https://medium.com/@strongblockio/strongblock-defi-protocol-v2-29b7cc663345)invest or don't. i don't give a shit. i'm an early investor just trying to spread the word for my own potential gains. i thought it would be really cool to have an ultimate guide for those new to crypto currencies and the terms used. i made this mostly for beginners and veterans alike. im not sure how much use you will get out of this. stuff gets lost on reddit quite easily so i hope this finds its way to you. included in this list,

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] while everybody has been focused on greyscale's bitcoin accumulation, the grayscale ethereum trust now holds over 2% of all eth in circulation.any other coins you know of that a percent is held by one organisation? [removed] [removed] [removed] hi everyone,so basically my question is: which coin out of bitcoin, bitcoin cash, dash and litecoin is the best to exchange? with that i mean the amount of fees and speed. the exchange im planning on using has no fees on small transactions. i just want to convert it to monero and am wondering which of these coins have a fast receiving speed and low fee? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] hopefully this might help some of the new people moving into this space.1. dont stress about price if your holding long term. its easy to sit there refreshing portfolio apps all day, dont do this, it will cause the crypto markets to determine your mood for that day.2. never share your keys with anyone.3. assume everything is a scam initially and do thorough research before putting any money into anything.4. check fees before sending transactions, sometimes they can be ridiculously high.5. consider investing a hardware wallet if your holding a significant amount.6. if your going to try day trading start with small amounts and build up experience.7. dont invest more than you can afford to lose. assume anything you invest could be gone by tomorrow.hope these help! [removed] [removed] just realized i own some moons and they are worth something. was very unexpected. thank you guys so much. you're the best. i'm going to have a nice dinner, get a few beers, and get a few gweis. have a good weekend! [removed] because i am a degenerate gambler (who tries to quit) i transferred the nano almost immediately to binance and open a 125x position on bitcoin. i hope you will not ask if long or short because you know how bitcoin moved in the last days. it does not matter, i got liquidated.this is what most of the gamblers do with money that falls from the sky, they gamble it all and 90% of them also lose it all.now, without any moon i think i missed the chance to be part of this very big movement, that is crypto currency. because if crypto succeeds, as i think it will, this subreddit might be the main source of news for everyone and looking of how hard is to get some moons now, i really think i blew it.i love nano, and i bough back, but how do i get my moons back on reddit? i can buy them also but where do i store then securely outside of reddit?also posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/comments/jbvqe7/a_guide_on_how_to_avoid_crypto_scams_bot_stop/) are making me think /r/cryptocurrency is heading the right way. so if you want 200 moons it seems you have to do a post at least as good as that. damn. [removed] with all the moons craze going on, i find discussions missing the topic of extreme interest for all current moon holders. it is my understanding (stemming from the below quoted extracts from official moons description in the app) that **theoretically speaking moons can be unilaterally taken away from us, while still in beta.**being a big fan of moons, i by no means am trying to fud here. im also pretty sure reddit wouldnt do something so radical - since it would undermine the whole idea of community-based approach, transparent blockchain movement, democracy and by extension - social networks reputation in the eyes of millions of crypto holders and reddits users. then again, it looks like they have left a way back for themselves here.a **welcome introduction** to the community points on the app states pretty clearly: thanks for joining our adventure. community points are currently a beta feature in some subreddits. **balances**, transactions, and memberships **may be reset during this period**.whereas subsection ***which ethereum network is it using?*** might already look somewhat more ambiguous:points are currently on the rinkeby testnet, and **balances**, transactions, and memberships **may be reset** during this period.afterwards, we will be migrating community points to the ethereum mainnet. **points balances will be carried over** (though will need to be reclaimed)  now it already sounds like a sure thingnext subsection also sounds equivocal:**complete control, like bitcoin.** your community points exist on the blockchain, independently of reddit, where they can only be controlled by you. **neither reddit, nor moderators can take your points away** or decide what you do with them. its all up to you.  it sounds like this refers to the mainnet era, yet present tense is used everywhere ergo  now too.**tl;dr/takeway**  official description is somewhat ambiguous, and imo it is so on purpose. im sure reddits got enough copywriters capable of expressing themselves quite clearly. so it looks like they have left the door open on purpose  in case something goes really wrong (which on the surface of it doesnt seem to be the case), **technically reddit can take your moons away, adjust balance or make any other changes while they still in beta.** having said that, it is really unlikely they would take such drastic actions, since it would be a real blow for their reputation and their digital era strategy. so as per usual in crypto, we are in a ***higher risk*****,** ***higher return*** **phase**, and its up to you to decide whether you ok with this. i was just blindly added as an approved user to r/xmr_enthusiasts.however, i do not post about monero, have never had any relationship to it. it was an unsolicited adding of myself as an approved user.the mod says they are "trying to support development of monero". therefore, it seems they are **harvesting redditor's usernames who comment on crypto related subs**, then adding them as approved users to a private sub to generate traffic and buzz.**to me, that is emblematic of either:****1) an unsophisticated operation****or****2) a scam**just wanted to alert the community. that sort of pr tactic could fly in 2017, but not 2020. we should all expect more sophisticated public messaging and transparency from legitimate projects and those who support those projects.so -- feelings about monero (xmr) aside; privacy is great -- please be cautious if you choose to participate in this sub.dyor/ymmv [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] 4 years ago when i bought bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies, i have discussed with my family  about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and telling them why i think it's future and a good idea. i gave my best to explain this technology, but it didn't help. they were laughing at me telling that it is so obvious that even an idiot would realize that it is a scam, and i felt a little bit humiliated. i somehow didn't want to tell them that i bought any crypto.  i was buying bitcoin every month when i was receiving the scholarship from my school. all went on crypto and i invested almost everything i saved. i also started working online and earning crypto, and guess what, i didn't told them even that. i was careful to stay unrevealed, and if they asked something i would just say i am studying. i keep doing this for years and wait for the perfect moment. i expect another bull run until the end of 2021, because we had halving this year. so, one more year and the biggest told you so moment in my life will come :) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] hellolooking for some help here regarding storing my crypto.it goes without saying that im looking for an/more options to do so, and where i control the keys.it could be a multipurpose wallet or it could be a wallet that primary is intended for btc and a wallet primary intended for eth.integration with nano and my keys are the most important aspects to take in to consideration.thank you all for the help, and have a nice day. [removed] so, i just added a $500 liquidity for a pair, and instantly "earned" 10%, which is obviously wrong, because there were no trades and the price of the pair did not change.so i tested it again, added $500 and "earned" $50 like magic.obviously no fees were earned, and that is a misleading metric.take that into consideration when you calculate your earnings on honeyswap.your liquidity\\fees earned are shown here - [https://info.honeyswap.org/account/](https://info.honeyswap.org/account/) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed]

[removed] everyones debt relies on the fact that everyone else pays their debt. government is in debt, billionaires, millionaires, people with 6 figures, the average worker, even the students. our god is debt, and thats why many refuse to look at the world in a different way.so at the moment you have a big subsection of the entire population of the world that cant pay their debt and they will be given options to help pay that and hold it off. but that relies on jobs, mental health, consistency and public order in overall compliancy with the systemits hit a level where to many holes are in the wall from to many different dimensions and the only thing that creates value in currencies drowned in debt is the fact that people are oblivious to the situation, paralysed by the fear and willing to continue for normalcy.fear is always overstated in hindsight and the western world has detached people from their ability to communicate with this process by hijacking peoples amygdalas with 24/7 news with problems derived from the curations of a debt driven society.then people join a group to fight the system by using the system to elevate their cause. we start arguing about whos the biggest victim, all stimulated by people who make money off this to pay off debt and benefit from the lower classes not self organising.the magic about systems is most people dont understand how interwoven they are into every fabric of society and the minds of how people see reality. world economies are the top dog in system hierarchy and when theyre dying it creates the vision that the world is too.the only answer i see out of this mess, and why i dont worry as much because humans are instinctual to evolutionary survival is gradual or sudden change to a new system that is better.some will hang onto the system as long as they can, mostly those benefiting from it and so heavily dependent on its survival. others will form socialist societies and fall to the flaws of humans as they always do. others will take the most profitable route for their own selfishness.and that would be bitcoin and cryptocurrencies i presume as they will offer value and riches, but security, incentivised debt free money making economies that provide growth, and they extend a hand for everyone of all classes to pull themselves out of the current system and start fresh.and people see that as bad but when you dont have system thats heavily indebted you actually can move and make changes in the world. you can organise people in magical ways and you can create wealth and jobs in sectors that people havent realised are there yet.its the top dog system, it just needs to be healthy it doesnt need to solve the worlds problems, people can do that, and theyll do it very quickly if the body of the world is in the right health to accompany you.the check mate scenario crypto has is pretty amazing and an undervalued talking point is that it will self organise the most intelligent people in the world at the top of wealth which people arent used to. we have one, thats elon musk, imagine 100's of elons organising society.the world will realise that they have no reason for their allegiance to the god of debt when given a path to the new god of wealth and prosperity. [removed] why are there no blockbuster bitcoin documentaries to bring the good word the masses? [removed] been out of the loop for a little bit and after settling in to a new apartment i'd like to convert my old pi (3b+) into a node.  would also be great if anybody could tell me which wallet might be wise to connect to said node. https://youtu.be/uhbq6tjuiac i am contemplating a move right now. i started at my company about two years ago and ive been contributing minimally to my 401(k). the money is basically in an index fund thats making about 11% per year.im thinking about liquidating all of it (about 10k usd) and buying btc.what do you guys think? should i do that?if so, should i do it now?or after january (where i would presumably have a year of gains to use to pay taxes on it)? i have to do 20 push-ups before i can check the price help!! i have somehow sent btc with a tiny fee, and need to top it up. i have replace-by-fee enabled, how do i top up the transaction fee via bitcoin knots?? have clicked everywhere and can't see it!! going over the `secp256k1` spec, i was reading through to the `sect571k1` secion (3.7.1).  might it be a good pqc stop-gap upgrade to `secp256k1`?  it is still defined on a koblitz curve giving the higher level of efficiency compared to random parameter selection and offers 15360 bit dsa equivalency compared to the current 3072 bit equivalency (5x increase).  agreed the signatures are twice as large and and would require twice the (witness) block space as well as much heavier load on verifying nodes, but perhaps it is a viable alternative given that it would require 5x as many qubits (in theory) to factor.if qc arrives in the next 50 years, might it be convenient to have a pr ready to deploy to simply "kick the can" down the road another century?

"the real price of bitcoin based on the current hash rate is about $ 32,000."**the difficulty of the network has not yet shown signs that the hash rate is reaching a new record in the short term. monday's assessments showed that the next adjustment will be neither up nor down, just like in the past***integration of desires***according to the index of fear and greed, investors tend to move slowly towards bitcoin. market data show that after august and saturation warnings, the market is now balancing with a downward slope. the index was 52 on monday and crossed 50 for the first time since the weekend of september 21. these tendencies put investors in a "neutral" position compared to august's intense greed and subsequent fear. the purpose of this index is to show when a global sale is made in the range of zero to 100. fluctuations, movements and market volume are half of the factors that determine the score of this index.***higher goals***finally, while few expect a sudden sell-off above $ 11,000, bitcoin experts are betting on higher targets.**the $ 11,000 area was previously an important area for failure, and the $ 10,800 is known as a "pivot" point that could push the market higher after the correction. bitcoin retreated to the $ 10,800 level and the key $ 11,150 level, closing its daily and weekly candle at around $ 11,400.* i'm working with a freelancer at a website that will give away to the users at every 21 days a chance to win a free hardware wallet.this was happened today :)https://i.ibb.co/dc6w6b5/img-20201017-162015.jpg any bitcoin sites that will sell me bitcoin if i live in hawaii? hi!why is there the need to implement changes to the original code that satoshi nakamoto wrote?bitcoin si not what is written in the whitepaper.wouldn't it be a better idea that we left satoshi's original idea intact and then fork into a new coin if people would rather use other implemented solutions?is there a coin that follows the whitepaper?thank you! simply bitcoin, a channel that breaks down all the daily bitcoin news. from twitter to important updates to cringy daily fails we have it all[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhelis5jksk&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhelis5jksk&amp;feature=youtu.be) [removed] [removed] just found this video on my hard drive that i'm not sure i uploaded anywhere. it was created in 2013 when /r/bitcoin had 18,000 subs. it was meant to inform people on how to get started with bitcoin and the services to use![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cal2yhpnixc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cal2yhpnixc) hi!i was thinking...is there someone who can change the code?who has access to it?how are code improvements implemented?who's the person who actually implements the change in the code?tnq **trading in cryptocurrency can involve decisions to buy, sell, or hold. depending on your investment goals or financial strategy, you may wish to take advantage of sudden opportunities to gain value or avoid loss. there are trading tools that can help manage efforts to carry out your plans. the stop order is one of the popular tools for managing market movement or price trends.**[stop loss](https://preview.redd.it/djyntx17bmt51.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3b2e9ba98d363bc10ce249e214198cd1667bab6)read more: [https://www.koinal.io/blog/how-to-limit-your-losses-using-a-stop-loss/](https://www.koinal.io/blog/how-to-limit-your-losses-using-a-stop-loss/) i have read on another forum (offshorecorptalk) that people can buy property, cars and luxury in switzerland, uae and even places in the usa.i wonder if there are other places inside the eu where it may be possible? **this is a faction not real life events**if you had to leave your country as fast as possible because you commit a crime , so you can't withdrawal all your savings so how fast you can convert it to a bitcoin and can you make it intractable and how much value you will if convert it back to real money if that even possible please utilize this sticky thread for all general **bitcoin** discussions! if you see posts on the front page or /r/bitcoin/new which are better suited for this daily discussion thread, please help out by directing the op to this thread instead. thank you!if you don't get an answer to your question, you can try phrasing it differently or commenting again tomorrow.[join us in the r/bitcoin chatroom!](https://s.reddit.com/channel/872992_7f67f22e296c2f65bd39f5af98f30a96b5e3e21e)please check the [previous discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/jc56lk/daily_discussion_october_16_2020/) for unanswered questions.

[removed] [removed] ok so about a year ago i discovered crypto, my first purchase was 20 bucks worth of btc at about 4 am, i had just finished verifying my coinbase account and was excited but nervous.  i sat watching it flucuate and move up in value.  i was instantly hooked.fast forward to current times and while i still do hold bitcoin i am heavily invested in ethereum and erc-20 tokens, while i still do buy ether on coinbase pro or gemani, im mostly using uniswap and about a third of my portfolio is locked up in lp tokens staked for uni.  ive been interested in defi since i discovered it this past spring and with good luck on my side ive taken profits on link i bought last winter and used my uni airdrop to actually get involved.  im hooked again.i want to take the rest of my fiat savings and cash it in for stable coins to stake that i can borrow against in case of emergency, its looking like if i did things this way it would be in my best interest to obviously keep a checking account so that i can actually utilize any funds i would borrow as i am in ny state and most of the options like nexo, block fi and crypto.com are not available for me.  i am not looking to do anything illegal or use a vpn to mask my location.  we can use celsius but in ny state it is very limited in comparison and to be honest something about it just tickles me the wrong way.im really asking and looking for two things.1.  ny state friendly or not, if you have made this move what did you do ? how do you think the best way to go about it is and what are some serious things to look out for.  i would prefer responses from people from ny state but would appreciate hearing from anyone at all.2.  while i have staked on multiple platforms compound, aave and uni i have never borrowed anything yet, how seamless is this normally and also is it possible to still be liquidated if you only borrow against stable coins ?  i normally use dai which as we know does flucuate in price a little.bonus round:  i have also heard that if you stake currency on lets say aave for example that borrowing against that allows you to utilize and sell your crypto without creating a taxable situation but whenever i hear this its never really made clear.  is this true, can i legit stake dai on aave and then borrow crypto against it, sell it on an exchange and withdraw it to my bank account to use without having to pay any taxs on the sale ?anyways thankyou all for reading my little thing, any help is super appreciated.  also yes i am aware of the risks of doing something like this but to be honest i am an everyday dude who works a shitty job, im willing to take these risks so i can pull myself out of this position. [removed] [removed] so there has been a lot of big investment into bitcoin lately. millions of dollars of investment by square, microstrategy, etc.yet the 24 hour volume seems pegged at $88 billion for a while now. i've been paying attention to crypto for a long time now and have seen the 24 hour volume go as low as $10b and go up to well over $100b. on any given day you can see billion dollar swings in volume.but not lately. $88b and staying within a very thin margin and i want to say this has been happening for at least a week but i may be wrong. never seen it so artificially stable. what's the reason for this? is this big money manipulation? ensuring they only invest up to this threshold to keep the price low? 24 hour volume is an indicator i find valuable because it shows how popular the market is and it being so stable just has me questioning why is it stable like this? i've seen it do this for a couple days but never like this. thoughts? [removed] [removed] ultimately, i'm wondering how cryptocurrency will be effected by future potus. if biden wins, will crypto traders benefit? or is trump's focus on business better for us in the "crypto race" i keep reading about? i've read up on news, but i'm curious to know what my fellow redditors think regarding future regulations.thanks for taking the time albeit the touchy subject! [removed] what are the current options out there on options trading for crypto? is there anything brewing as far as binance is concerned? a legit platform with some liquidity would be pretty amazing... a place for all the robinhood degens to come and yolo their stimulus checks.

[removed] "i'll just have to wait a few days what's the rush?"little did i know that until that pending swap goes through, all of the other funds on my metamask wallet have been put in queue behind it. so i have essentially softlocked my wallet.don't be like me! with spark adding a defi aspect (in a way) to xrp do yall think it will help legitimize xrp in the general communitys opinion? will it further increase the distaste some have for it? i am curious about yall opinions and possible plans. will people with interest try to accumulate xrp for more spark, or simply buy spark?i know xrp is shunned here so lets try to be civil in our opinions. i previously posted that i had made an entire bitcoin (more or less) just from freebies, airdrops and staking.  i have no given up trading for good (maybe) and am more focused on passive income, which i find much more fun and relaxing.  nothing like waking up in the morning and counting your free income.one of my main passive income sources now (apart from reddit moons of course!) is farming.  by that i mean i am a liquidity pool provider and i stake my liquidity pool tokens to earn the native platform token - i.e. stake weth / wbtc and earn uni.so far my main farming activity has been exactly that, weth and wbtc.  the liqudity fees are quite low, but the bonus uni is quite nice.  approximately 1 btc matched with eth will provide you with roughly 23 uni a week.  so that is around $70, or a 0.6% return per week, plus pool fees.  not bad if you consider it "free" money.but now honey-swap has initiated its own farming programme via '[hny.farm](https://hny.farm)' (put that address in your browser to go there).  i'm currently farming the main pool which is "dai daisies" - or xdai / honey.  after 24 hours i have checked my fees and pool holdings, combined with my free honey and it's a 5% return per day (the price of honey is flat today so this is pure fees and rewards).  and even second day, i claim my free honey (via their faucet), harvest my honey, buy a bit of xdai and put it back in the pool.this will obviously fluctuate - but even if it was 1% a day that is nearly double what my weth / wbtc pool produces in a week.and the great thing is that the gas fees are a fraction of a penny, and transactions are instant, so you can efficiently do this even if you have very small amounts.now if somebody could figure out how the hell taxes work with all this i'd be sitting pretty. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i have basically maxed out my 401k to grab all my employer match, and throw max into my ira.  with my ira i feel the tax sheltered status is worth the limitation of the grayscale options.  in my 401k, i'm trying to weigh out the opportunity cost of no crypto vs the actual loss of employer match.  i figured some outside opinions were called for. [removed] [removed] bitcoin's technology says that the more you pay in fees, the faster your transaction will be processed."poor" holders, who want to send small amounts, therefore pay lower fees, are at the bottom of the pool. their transactions may take hours or even days.isn't this concept fundamentally wrong with bitcoin? (not only bitcoin though, most cryptos)there shouldnt be a discrimination. all users, all transactions should be processed with the same speed. i mean every fintech does this already.this will be the major wall to overcome if we want bitcoin to be the money of the future.i'll be glad to be proved wrong. [removed] [removed] it seems like most other exchanges have created their own original token yet, coinbase hasn't (at least not yet). why is this? i am sure that it would create a large amount of income for them and they could also generate quite a bit of hype if they do an airdrop. does coinbase need to do this? no, but most companies want to maximize their profits and increase their income as much as possible regardless of need or expenses.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] let's say i have $10k in usd and $10k in eth (so that we can reduce the impact of fees), how would you go about maximising my yield?i'm seeing 7% for eth on celsius and 11.55% on usd. both of these are very passive and amazing rates. but yield farming comparison sites are showing close to 40% on weth/usd pairs on something like suhiswap- is that realistic for any sustained period? or will it be 30% or 5%?i understand weth, contract risk and impermanent loss (though i don't know how much it realistically impacts the 40% annual return). so do i make weth out of eth, send to a wallet along with usdc and start earning interest in those 2 currencies?any other platforms/tricks i'm missing? [removed] i have been watching bitcoin closely and going down the rabbit hole for 4 years or more now. as a life long gamer and entrepreneur it all clicked pretty quickly for me. i always talk about my passions so my network has heard me mention crypto now and then.the past year has been great for on boarding people to crypto. i have helped a 5-6 people make their first purchase now and had some good conversations. one of my favorite people to talk with is an older guy i am friends with. he owns an insurance business so he is not much of a risk taker lol.but he has worked in banking / insurance / financial world for over 30 years now. so he has quite a bit of real world experience and valuable insight. the conversations are great, but he is always been very anti bitcoin.well i always kept the conversation polite and just pushed the fundamental principles of bitcoin. never talk down to him, we have both seen plenty of opportunities we did not invest in do well. you can't invest in everything so we would just agree to disagree.... until i just got a call from him asking to bring over whatever i need to explain how to buy bitcoin to him . last time i talked to him i said it would be silly for you to not go by at least one or two bitcoin. it's money he can afford to lose and the upside is just ridiculous compared to any other trade we can make right now. ie gold, land, equities, rental properties.so wish me luck explaining this all from a technical perspective to a 68 year old!!!keep your interactions with people positive and be patient with people that are not there yet. we all have our aha moment. cheers! [removed] for me its my friends,  when they start complaining how crypto is stupid and start talking about tulip mania ill known its time to get out. pretty much nobody i know talks about crypto or is interested other than to call people in it idiots. when they start saying they wish they bought is my signal. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i have seen a previous post with a survey results that showed how many people own or owned crypto in different countries.there were a lot more in african and 3-world  ones.why do you think that is ?i personally believe its because of need. in most western countries you can get by and live okay without but over there its gonna be hard without dome kind of equalizer. so they research more and a more willing to try new things. at least i believe that, what would you say ? [removed] [removed] this is an account i used to use for crypto-only stuff, but it didnt get included in the first moon distribution. was it because i hadnt posted in a long time? from what ive read it sounds like all accounts with posts in r/cryptocurrency shouldve been included and i dont see anything about people who hadnt posted for a while. [removed] [removed] [removed] 95% of this sub is moon farmers shitposting clickbait articles and fake news.the consequences are low quality, worthless content.posting nothiing but greed and lies is counterproductive to what cryptocurrency aims to achieve.i appreciate the mods have a difficult job filtering the garbage. a more reliable crypto source is badly needed. **this is not a proposal this is just a simple poll**simple yes or no poll due to the latest development in the community.a 0.5 moons (for example) for each downvote (yes moons can be divided) in order to fight the downvoting bots.no moons = no downvotes.the moons will go to the community fund.[view poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/jcvef9) [removed] [removed] [https://cryptobriefing.com/monero-scales-10x-with-latest-upgrade/](https://cryptobriefing.com/monero-scales-10x-with-latest-upgrade/)bullish for monero, i'm very optimistic for the coin's future growth :)what do you guys think? so, reddit has found a new way to monetize the internet. and the more i think about it, the more i see it as a genius move.we know that social media make money on ads (and probably personal data leaks but let's not get into that). so, they are incentivizing people that contribute positively to the community with money, which makes the space more interesting, brings more engagement, and therefore more revenue for reddit.also, the more quality content the more interesting the place becomes, but the good thing is it's not just about quality content, if the post is a funny meme or just something interesting it also gets upvotes, so everything that people see as positive gets rewarded, which is exactly what makes someone keep coming back or joining a community.i remember the daily discussion here had about 200-300 comments on average most times before moons were implemented, now we are getting 2k comments on weekdays (!) so we can see that it is actually working.when someone contributes a website with a review, they are somehow contributing for the data of that particular website to be more reliable (the more reviews and better quality of them will surely bring more users) and also increases their revenue. imagine they start paying users for quality reviews.point is, we might have started a experiment that could become the new internet standard. what they are doing here can be also applied on basically any website that increases the number of visitors with community contribution, which are the absolute majority nowadays.and the best thing about it is that reddit themselves spent very little on this (basically the cost of creating a crypto) and all of this could happen thanks to cryptocurrencies!so thank you reddit for implementing moons, i really think it's a win win for everybody! assuming that the given number of moons to be distributed in a given cycle, are divided by the total number of upvotes in that cycle, will users see drastically diminishing returns on their contributions as subs grow in popularity/activity? [removed] [removed] since i always found it interesting to look at posts with cryptocurrency predictions from a few years ago and see how they held up over the years i thought i make this post as a sort of time capsule to look back to in a few years from now.so my question to you folks for the year 2025 would be:\-which coins do you think will be in the top 10 by 2025.\-what global crypto marketcap do you expect by then?\-whats the price of bitcoin gonna be?\-will bitcoin still be in place number 1 or will some other crypto have taken its place.\-how far do you think adoption in general will have gone by then (usage of cryptocurrency in the general daily life)&amp;#x200b;now please do not downvote or rage at eachother in the comments just because your crypto is not in their prediction of the future top 10. these are after all just nothing more than opinions. so please stay civil. looking forward to see some interesting predictions :) thanks guys! as you can see, i have 3000+ karma on this sub.https://i.imgur.com/yxkk6zh.pngbut when i opened the vault the first time, i didn't have any moons to collect. did i do something wrong? is there a way to collect them now?or did i understand it wrong ? that the first distribution was for users that already had karma on this sub we currently have three reddit cryptos i believe: moons, bricks and donuts. each have their own subreddits. do you see more subreddits adopting one of these, or creating their own coin in the near future?the idea behind these is wonderful. instead of gifting people awards wich cost a lot, but dont add much for the creator we can directly tip them, making it really worth their while.of course we already have bat from the brave browser, wich works in every sub and on some other websites as well, but not a lot of people use this.or do you see a lot of people using the brave browser in the future? i think we are at least gonna see some change wich will allow us to directly tip content creators. [removed] i'm trying to find out if there are any online stores where i can buy sneakers/trainers with crypto, specifically in europe.i know about the obvious, big generic stores such as amazon and overstock. they are little too generic for what i am looking for though. i am ideally looking for online stores that specifically deal in sneakers/footwear. i know it may be a little specific, but hoping someone may be able to point me in the right direction. it makes perfect sense btc is popular in such countries on the brink of disaster as venezuela, african countries or even turkey and argentina. it also figures that the most rich pals like swiss and dutch inhabitants, germans and austrians research and usually by extension stack btc - not only they have money, but also foresight and decent education. for me what looks to be missing in this equation is more middle tier/medium income countries from europe and asia.what's your take on that?ps it's also worth bearing in mind that there is almost 100% correlation between google trends and btc price - looks like the trends starting to pick up with btc holding well above 11 k[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] &amp;#x200b;bitcoin's technology says that the more you pay in fees, the faster your transaction will be processed."poor" holders, who want to send small amounts, therefore pay lower fees, are at the bottom of the pool. their transactions may take hours or even days.isn't this concept fundamentally wrong with bitcoin? (not only bitcoin though, most cryptos)there shouldnt be a discrimination. all users, all transactions should be processed with the same speed. i mean every fintech does this already.this will be the major wall to overcome if we want bitcoin to be the money of the future.i'll be glad to be proved wrong. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] stumbled across this video about things to avoid when purchasing or trading crypto:https://youtu.be/i6niktnie5iwhat other deadly sins or things to avoid, would you tell new traders and hodlers?first and most obvious is dont keep your crypto on an exchange. bitcoin has reigned as the undisputedking of cryptocurrenciessinceit was createda little over ten years ago.the bitcoin price has soared,with some ups and downs, over the last decadeclimbing to around $11,300 per bitcoin today and giving bitcoina total value of over $200 billion.now, as the market for stable coinscryptocurrencies pegged to traditional currencies or assetshas doubled in the last three months, a new report has predicted the largest stable coin, the controversial tether, could become the second most valuable cryptocurrency after bitcoin as soon as next yearwith the still deflating broad crypto-asset bubble  migrating assets toward tether.tether represents what many of the so-called cryptocurrencies arent: a stable form of payment, bloomberg senior commodity strategist mike mcglone wrote in the companyscrypto outlookreport for the fourth quarter of 2020.over recent years, bitcoins primary use case has evolved from a payments system to a store of value and more recently as a hedge against the inflation some see inon the horizon. mcglone expects recent unprecedented central bank stimulus spending and rising debt-to-gdp levels around the world to act as a strong tailwind for the bitcoin price, putting it on course to reach a whopping $100,000 per bitcoin by 2025.indicating demand for a digital version of gold (bitcoin) and a crypto-asset like the dollar, if current trends prevail, the market cap of tether may surpass ethereum next year, mcglone wrote, adding it should take something significant to stall the increasing adoption of tether which has been growing rapidly in contrast to the stagnant market cap of ethereum.ethereum currently boasts a market capitalization of a little over $40 billion, compared to tethers relatively paltry near-$16 billion. however, tethers total value has ballooned 300% over the last 12 months, while ethereums has merely doubled.bitcoins market value has risen at an even slower pace than ethereum, adding just under 40% since this time last year.meanwhile, tethers cumulative transaction volume has increased by around 20% over the past 30 days to climb above $600 billion, according to blockchain analytics firmglassnode. tethers daily transaction volume is around $35 billion according to an average from cryptocurrency data sites coingecko and coinmarketcap, with bitcoins average daily transaction volume put at between $20 billion and $25 billion.makes me fell dirty that a media outlet talks about tether like this.

UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// he was talking about his first encounters with satoshi and that he mined a few blocks but didn't like it cause it would make his computer run hot. does anyone know which one i'm talking about? i am brand new to bitcoin, i recently got a coinbase acct and put 200 in, im thinking of starting a gemini account or some other simple platform to start with. i need help lol i really do not know what i am doing. i am curious to know if anyone out there has made a large chunk of money from coinbase platform? is it a total joke? i see so much negative. i would have used another but its taken so long to get verified and im feeling i need bitcoin asap and nervous to put a large amount of money in coinbase. if bitcoin becomes really expensive i dont want to miss the bus on that hi everyone, this news on strike was posted more than 2 weeks ago, but im afraid it didnt get enough traction in my opinion.[original post on strike app supporting on-chain txns](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/izlika/jackmallers_demoing_onchain_payments_coming_to_ln/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)exchanges these days should be called what they are: shitcoin casinos. gemini, coinbase, binance, bittrex, and all the others that sell pump and dump shitcoins, are our enemies. theres no two ways around it. coinbase is running public relations in full force to make it seem like they support bitcoin development when they want to provide grants for core developers. in reality, they could care less about the development as long as they get their bottom line, which is to pull in suckers.have you heard the phrase, if you dont know who the sucker in the room is, its you?well you are the sucker every single time if you are trying to trade bitcoin and shitcoins.its time to support bitcoin only companies. that means buying coldcard hardware wallets that have bitcoin only firmware. that means buying from river financial (will be largest brokerage in the future), swan bitcoin (auto dca with withdrawals only), cashapp, and fold (bitcoin back on gift card purchases). anything less is you not supporting bitcoin adoption.id like to circle back to the point of this post: what jack mallers strike app has done is make exchanges completely irrelevant. gone are the insane and wack percentage fees that cause you to miss out on hodling even more precious sats.your bank checking account now literally speaks bitcoin. its not just a lightning network based app that allows you to pay only lightning network invoices.you can also just pay for the on-chain transaction fee to your legacy address (1), segwit address (3), or native segwit bech 32 address (bc1).so when you plan to stack sats in the united states, i highly recommend you skip the outrageous fees and send bitcoin instantaneously to your coldcard or whatever hardware wallet you own with ease.simply deposit the money within the strike app from your bank checking account, and paste or scan your bitcoin address. clarify the amount to you want to send and tap confirm. i cant stress this enough - the only fee associated with the purchase is the on-chain transaction fee.i hope this post gets more traction and that word spreads to keep people from getting suckered. [removed] what are some of the best books explaining bitcoin? there are *literally* thousands of books explaining the stock market. there are tons of blog articles about bitcoin, but i get overwhelmed with articles and blogs. example scenario: you've set up a 2-of-3 multisig watch only wallet in electrum or some other desktop wallet, and you use it to generate receive addresses.  how do you protect yourself from maliciously generated receive addresses for this wallet, in the case that the desktop software is compromised? how do you validate that the receive addresses are correct and not an attacker's receive address? how do you limit trust of the desktop software wallet?with typical single-sig p2pkh and p2wpkh the receive addresses can be independently verified to belong to a known xpub key using any bitcoin software library and a small script. hardware wallets can also be used to generate or verify receive addresses so the software wallet doesn't not need to be trusted. some hardware wallets also verify the change address for a given transaction also belongs to the xpub key in question.so how do you do this kind of verification for multisig wallets? or are people not verifying and instead just trusting that their software wallet of choice is not compromised? i haven't found examples online to do this. it appears that in the coldcard multisig set up process for a 2-of-3 setup, each device is aware of the other 2 xpubs, so presumably it has the information to perform this kind of verification, but i don't know if it actually does that verification. 18 months ago, i loaded a very small amount to a polymerbit note and thought i was being "funny" by generating a vanity address.cant remember exactly how i generated it, possibly bitcoinvanitygen.com which is now offline.possible exit scam?  i would have generated the address offline on tails using the source code.noticed today that it was swiped a while ago along with 120 other addresses (all vanity) https://www.smartbit.com.au/tx/e44790f73b9f3a20256885f8c847d1202d2f5bdf7196defdaa8631fcdfa986b7dont mess with them, even if you are using source code on a clean os. there goes my $20. lol.

until the next bull run? well i hope no guys!i hope that i was able to wake up one or the other of you and to warn you what could also happen to you guys  luckily the frozen/lost amount is still small in percentage terms from what i invested, but it is still a lesson.in other words: not your keys, not your tokens.... kucoin edition anyone in uk used one, what notes were accepted? bitcoin has had some crazy theories and beliefs attached to it, i have heard some people say that bitcoin is hacked, its a ponzi scheme, it is an ai from the future.what are some crazy bitcoin myths you have heard? its like one or two thousand more then what it costs..? **the record of sending btc in bakkt exchange shows the interest of organizations in these cryptocurrencies**the bakkt exchange broke its historic bitcoin record in october, marking a significant leap in corporate demand for btc.following the significant increase in the demand for bitcoin by state-owned companies in recent months, bakkt exchange has experienced another record from september 20 to october 20.bakkt's digital asset payment and exchange platform is designed for corporate investors in the united states and is operated by the new york mercantile exchange, the intercontinental exchange. the increase in the futures market of the bakkt bitcoin market, which physically settles bitcoin contracts, signals an increase in organizations' demand for cryptocurrency assets. cme, lmax digital and bakkt trading volumes indicate that the institutional bitcoin market is growing rapidlythere is a significant increase in the volume of futures transactions in several exchanges in october.in october 400 btc contracts in bakkt expire. monthly data show a 14% jump compared to september. the volume of outstanding bakkt contracts is important in measuring organizational activities because this exchange is one of the three platforms along with lmax digital and cme.a significant increase in the delivery of futures contracts in bakkt means an increase in the demand of organizations.another btc record for bakkt this month. more than 400 btc futures contracts expired in october, up 14 percent from september. with another record breaking in bakkt, the demand of organizations for bitcoin is increasing.bakkt, lmax digital and cme platforms, at the forefront of trading activities, are constantly receiving high demand. skew data show that lmax digital is the largest spot exchange service in the global market by volume. according to lmax digital, skew has processed $ 135.6 million in btc over the past 24 hours. this is more than the daily volume of coinbase, kraken and other retail-focused exchanges.because lmax digital facilitates corporate trading in the first place, this exchange reflects the corporate image of bitcoin beyond coinbase. there is a lot of demand from institutions, especially after the recent investments of square and microstrategy. similar to bakkt, the cme bitcoin futures market has seen an increase in the volume of outstanding contracts. as of october 2, after the expiration of the september contracts, the unsettled bitcoin contracts in cme increased from $ 345 million to $ 561 million.industry managers view this institutional growth positivelycryptocurrency industry executives and investors expect the growing trend of corporate demand for bitcoin to continue. silly question;i have an electrum wallet that i don't use anymore, but i can't send the few satoshis that are still on it due to the miner fees. is there a way i can still send these satoshis? maybe without a miner fee? **bitcoin upward breakout possible despite okex exchange scandal**the price of bitcoin lost its uptrend, which reached $ 11.7 thousand earlier this week, but the current range may provide good opportunities for traders.earlier this week, the price of bitcoin (btc) rose to $ 11,725 after last week's news that square had bought 4,709 bitcoins, but since then the price has fallen again. several falls in the $ 11,500 range and the recent negative news from okex that the exchange's withdrawal service was suspended due to "interrogation" of the company's ceo by chinese judicial authorities affected investor sentiment and the price of bitcoin.a wave of negative news pushed most altcoins into the red zone and halted the uptrend of bitcoins. bitcoin's daily time frame indicates that a loss of the $ 11,200 area could pave the way for a re-test of $ 11,100, a level that is in the vpvr gap and is likely to cause a re-drop to $ 10,900.the $ 11,000 support level is now essential to resume the uptrend, and btc may find it difficult to maintain this level as the re-quarantine situation caused by the corona virus has frightened investors.if bitcoin loses $ 11,000 support, it is likely to fall below $ 10,000 (200-ma and $ 9,750), which is close to the cme gap. while the current price action is frustrating for bullrun who want to retest the $ 12,000 level, a big look shows that there are a number of factors that favor bitcoin. given the economic uncertainty that results from the covid-19 epidemic, the recent acquisition of btc by microstrategy, square and stone ridge is a positive signal.in addition, trading volume at several btc futures exchanges is rising againbakkt exchange has reached a new record in sending btc. bitcoin has also largely ignored negative news over the past two months, above $ 10, and buyers have shown great interest in buying close to that level.wait for the support area to be re-testedit should also be noted that only about 1.5 weeks have passed since bitcoin withdrew from a 24-day intensive phase, followed by an upward breakout to $ 11,750.since breaking the uptrend, the $ 11,200 level has been tested as support again, but a deeper pullback to 20-ma to test the $ 11,000 is not surprising. even a fall to the $ 10.650 level near the 100-ma could test the downtrend line from the $ 12.467 ceiling that started in 2020. in the short term, the price of bitcoin seems to be trading in the range of $ 11,400-9,700 (ideal range for traders). seems scammers are ruling the world these days. i got scammed all of my money by this shady brokerage called crystaltwistfunding and left in debt then tried to find ways to recover it and went to recovercoins@engineer.com after seeing a post...dude is a complete scam even though i tried to negotiate payment only after he was successful.even lied about a wifes miscarriage to try to sound like hes human. just a scumbag preying on desperate souls [removed] because you become one who understands that the entire core of the power structure of our society today is rotten through and through.  you understand this corruption stems from the fact that since the 70s it's been based on a debt based fiat currency which gives the hands of a few absolute power to create infinite supply of this currency that we sell our time, labor and goods for every second of every day. you also realize that if we can change that core to one where it's based on a non governmental /non corporate controlled hard asset that is the world's first truly finite asset that the people of the world get to decide on the value (supply) that we can take the next step in human evolution and create a world that rather than the current fiat masters, that we all collectively decide what our time is worth and not the other way around.you realize that it is truly possible to achieve this but that the only way to do so is to take physical possession of your private keys away from any custodial solution as you understand that possession is 10/ 10ths of the law with bitcoin and every satoshi counts. you then become one of us. one who regardless of what the current fiat currency value stamped on these banker backed exchanges is that you dollar cost average every time you get any extra money. you do it because you want a better future not only for yourself, but also your family and friends. you see it can happen as more and more people do just what you've done and you have your faith in humanity restored even in the darkest days.welcome to the people's peaceful revolution that is bitcoin! &amp;#x200b;[ladies and gentlemen you are witnessing a looong time you have had to accumulate cheap bitcoin . i hope u did so .](https://preview.redd.it/jxa50ry5mtt51.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20723cbc4dd59989d3f8063fbdc16e4f1de57f86) [removed] analogy: vhs is to dvd as existing social contracts are to btc. (and more specifically, with regard to the sudden perceptual flip that happened when dvds became available, as explained below)if you're old enough, maybe you can remember when vhs (or even betamax) was the standard. vhs quality seemed fine, since that's what everyone was used to. needing to wait several minutes to rewind and fast-forward was normal. it was really only bad if the tracking was off, which could be fixed.then dvds came out, and \*instantly\* vhs seemed super shitty, suddenly by comparison. we didn't realize how terrible vhs was until a better option was available.well i think i'm noticing that dynamic, except instead it's between existing social contracts and btc. previous social contracts like fiat, entitlement programs, insurance, stocks of companies that can issue more shares at will (e.g. tsla), etc, seemed good enough before. that was just how the world worked, and it worked well enough, until...now there's btc. and more specific to my experience, now that i've set up my own node and can verify transactions without trusting 3rd parties, the feeling of minimized counterparty risk is something you can get used to. having gotten used to that, now suddenly many other facets of the world suddenly seem much more shitty/scammy than before. euro and usd suddenly start to seem to have a lot in common with scammy altcoins, especially with so much uncertainty about the future monetary policy of any given fiat currency. politicians suddenly seem to not need to be taken as seriously. banks are suddenly that much less of gate keepers to the world of finance.the matrix starts to look a little different after you take the orange pill :) who tryna buy me a new pc im tired of this console bullshit kbm on console is so ass #   [https://freemining.co/518033](https://freemining.co/518033) [removed] [removed] if there is a bullrun, what's your way of selling your coins if they are in a cold wallet? you send them to an exchange and then sell them from there?could there be a problem with the exchanges being congested? its almost scam-like. made an account that was originally email based years ago. when you created your account they didnt pop up a recovery seed.now they require a recovery seed to login.$640 down the drain currently my wallet allows me to generate a segwit address (starting with 3) or segwit native address (starting with bc) independently. these are two separate derivation paths from one master public key. is this a non-standard wallet extension, or is there some bip specifying a standard way for the same wallet to generate both segwit and segwit native addresses?i'm reading bip32 but am working through it slowly, so would appreciate a pointer on where to look for the above (might even be a different bip). i am currently away from my pc and not able to use uniswap to move my montra dao tokens that are on my ledger, is there any mobile wallets that support the nano x bluetooth so i can connect my ledger and view/send my tokens?edit: ledger live doesn't support montra dao tokens or i would use that looking for a similar wallet that will allow me to send me tokens on mobile.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] this is an exciting takeaways and summary about polkadot from a bloomberg article. the link is below.1. according to a report by outlier ventures, polkadot platform has seen the biggest jump in active developers of all major crypto protocols.2. the number of monthly active developers building on polkadot increased by 44% in the 12 months ending in may.3. there are 253 projects, ranging from stablecoins to social networks, that are being built on polkadot4. instead of operating apps through smart contracts -like on the ethereum blockchain -- polkadot allows each app developer to create her own blockchain that can talk to other ledgers.this allows for a lot of different innovative products that cant exist in a smart contract environment - according to gavin woods5. according to dan morehead of pantera capital - "polkadot is only trading at 10% of the value of ethereum, and our theory is that it has a much higher than 10% chance of being a competitor to ethereum.https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-10-17/ethereum-blockchain-killer-goes-by-unassuming-name-of-polkadot just a list of things i wish people told me before i had invested in crypto.1. dont time the market, dollar-cost-average. just buy a set amount every week. you will be better off this way. make sure when you buy on an exchange, move it to one of your wallets as not your keys, not your crypto, is a true enough statement.2. do your own research before you buy a project. i would only recommend btc and eth for newbies, and if they want to diversify into other projects, see the work that has been done on the project, see if the developers are active, and make sure the developers are trustworthy (to prevent pump-and-dumps).3. invest in a hardware wallet like a ledger or trezor if you are going to invest a decent amount of money into crypto, like 500+ of usd, eur, gbp, etc. it is worth the (less than) 100 $// to hold on a hardware wallet, rather than holding on a software (like a on a computer or phone) wallet, that is subject to malware or a false version of a wallet.make sure to only purchase brand new hardware wallets from the official websites of ledger, trezor, etc.if you have any other bits of advice, please give it up, as this sub gets a decent amount of new users a day, and some are beginners who want to learn something.

[removed] there has been a time where there was so much gold no one really gave any value to it. these days it is very scarce so people will pay a lot of money for it!the same is happening to bitcoins. right now every 10 minutes there are new bitcoins mined. in 103 years or so that will no longer be the case.history repeats and right now we are living in a gold rush and most people do not even know it! [removed] hi there. i just wanted to know if there was any way to create 2 different (2/3) multisig addresses with the same public keys?i've tried putting them in multiple times but it always returns the exact same address using the 3 keys which i guess is to be expected. any way around this?any help appreciated!

https://bitcoinist.com/analytics-firm-200000-bitcoin-is-currently-locked-within-okexs-wallets/ maybe this has been suggested before, but it was a new idea to me. i've been trying to find a more indestructible way to store my seedwords, so they would be safe from both fire and water. you can easily use those personalized dog tag makers they have at pet and grocery stores to engrave your words. obviously, you need to be smart, alert, and aware of cameras, but it can be done safely, especially if you spread them across multiple tags(maybe 4 tags with 5 ea). to be completely safe, you could print them from different locations, so your complete set of words was never all in one place. i think this is a relatively cheap, easily accessible way to feel more confident about seedword storage. hope it helps! the masses would presumably use government-backed digital currency instead of crypto, right? how ln is trying to solve scalability is through connecting each node to every other node. as soon as you do that lightning network makes btc a security. ln is not a solution for scaling rather creates a new problem. what i have [here](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/working-papers/2020/wp20-19.pdf) is the future.a report by the federal reserve bank of philadelphia, released just four months ago.the topic?central bank digital currency.the implications for society?**colossal.**&amp;#x200b;the abstract of the paper outlines what we are going to discuss.*"the introduction of a central bank digital currency (cbdc) allows the central bank to engage in large-scale intermediation by competing with private financial intermediaries for deposits.****...the central bank arises as a deposit monopolist, attracting all deposits away from the commercial banking sector***."&amp;#x200b;what does this mean in practical terms?well, what *is* a central bank digital currency?**well, it is essentially a current account at the central bank.**when they say "*competing with private financial intermediaries for deposits*", it means the central banks are going to streamroll the commercial banks.&amp;#x200b;this is again emphasised in the introduction of the paper:"*besides its potential role in eliminating physical cash, a cbdc will allow the central bank to engage in large-scale intermediation by competing with private financial intermediaries for deposits (and, likely engaging in some form of lending of those deposits).****in other words, a cbdc amounts to giving consumers the possibility of holding a bank account with the central bank directly***."&amp;#x200b;academic economists are being used as a propaganda tool to push the narrative of the central banks and their wider agenda.when people hear the word "banker", they often think about the excesses of wall street and firms like goldman sachs.they don't split it up into investment banking, commercial banking and central banking.they think about the movies they watched and how it was the *investment bankers* who caused the great recession in 2008.complex jargon like mortgage backed securities and collateralised debt obligations.**although there were some investment bankers worthy of jail time in that particular crisis, in reality it was the fed, the** **central bankers, who facilitated the 2008 recession.**it is the central bankers who are creating these boom/bust cycles, and they are already more powerful than ever before.&amp;#x200b;but, we are missing a key piece.incentive drives human behaviour.**if you are trying to promote a change of this magnitude, you need an incentive.**but you also need a *catalyst* \- you need people to be desperate and psychologically worn down.i'm not sure what that *catalyst* could be, of course...but what is the incentive?well, probably some form of universal basic income - but this short term carrot comes with a long term stick.we are witnessing the erosion of free speech, and now financial privacy will be tied into that structure.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4sowjddzsi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4sowjddzsi) [removed] i am into rust, so i have been looking at near lately.[https://near.org](https://near.org)i like how rust is used for smart contracts. near's documentation is really easy to follow and they have a good dev program and support.my question is why build on near? i know i am missing something because i do not see the benefits of building on near vs building on ethereum.some really good scaling solutions are being released right now for ethereum, such as zksync, and these completely change the game when it comes to gas and congestion.also i have been looking for projects built on near, however i couldn't find anything... if someone knows of a project built with near could you link to it please?

[removed] [removed] [removed] a decade ago it happened first time when a random dude bought a pizza with bitcoins. now, 10 years later we have an entire ecosystem. to be honest to go completely crypto there are still a lot of questions to be answered and opinions to be updated.when years and decades pass it's sure that we will all remember one thing which was one of our first steps to the bright crypto future.so, what was your first buy with crypto? [removed] [removed] [removed][view poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/je02lp) [removed] [removed] we have seen a major craze take off in providing liquidity to various protocols. a very destructive pattern initially emerged, that ruined value. the basic pattern is this:stake x/y in return for rewards of x. where where y is a token of value, and x is a new token.this pattern is inherently inflationary, and always results in the token going to zero. that said, the ideal of being able to obtain a stable income is extremely appealing. however, the basic pattern can be modified.stake x/y in return of rewards for x, but the x that is on the market will be burned (somehow)stake x/y in return of rewards for x, but a % of every transaction will be burned.stake x/y in return of rewards for x, but the token goes through a deflationary phase.stake x/y in return of rewards for x, but the amount of x obtained is continually decreasing.if you add these fundamental changes to a farming token, the behavior of the token changes drastically. here are a few examples:a % of every transaction will be burned.[https://rottenswap.org/#/](https://rottenswap.org/#/)the token goes through a deflationary phase.[https://niceee.org/#/](https://niceee.org/#/)the amount of x obtained is continually decreasing+ the x that is on the market will be burned[https://harvest.finance/](https://harvest.finance/)the x that is on the market will be burned (somehow)[https://dracula.sucks/](https://dracula.sucks/)post your favorite farming tokens. been trading since 2017 and those vibes are coming back over the last month. ive been loading up on xrp, cardano, bnb and a small amount of neo.looking for crypto that have real world use cases and a experienced team.vechain was one coin i had started collecting in 2018-2019 but i dumped , as i doubted the teams ability to achieve there business goal.been looking currently at dot and zil though i get that gut feeling that these arent the best investments.dose the community have any recommendations for a coin that has a real world use case? *in response to a post about how moons 'ruin'* r/cc*.*# opinion:moon is an awesome solution towards all the shitposting, and having more participation in this subreddit.i have never seen such high quality posts at the frontpage (indeed, new is a shitshow), because all the bad content gets filtered out with downvotes.also posts have more quality comments than ever before.&amp;#x200b;tl;dr: moons are pushing people to create better content, and is providing more reactions and discussions than in a long while. stumbled across this link this morning whilst i was looking into upcoming coinbase earn courses:https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2019/08/12/eleven-free-courses-to-learn-bitcoin-blockchain-and-cryptocurrencies/https://www.classcentral.com/tag/cryptocurrencystill available for people to do to educate themselves and may be useful to pass on to newcomers to promote the technology behind it all.feel free to add other links to free courses and learning material.

[removed] [removed] this guy is considered as an "influencer" by many, but he is just a very pretentious person, once you follow him for a while his views are borderline obnoxious. he recently got called out by the developer of uniswap, pomp literally had no idea on the topic he was talking about. pomp claimed "govts could take down uniswap" without even knowing its a bunch of code that no one can really take down, even if the site gets seized the contracts will continue to execute on the ethereum network. in the end it became quite embarrassing for him and he got ratio'd badly.just today, he has been tweeting about defi.. he has long maintained that defi is a scam and only bitoin is legit. today he apparently checked out few defi apps like aave / uniswap, and his latest tweet is "bitcoin is the original defi". lol [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] leverage killed many big players in past:1) back in 1929 stock market crashed hard, s&amp;p500 gone down 83% and many people lost a lot of money except one guy.  he is none other than jesse livermore. he made a lot of money by shorting the market back in 1929 and became the richest person of u.s.a. soon his confidence turned into overconfidence and he started trading with bigger funds. after few years (1932) most of his trades started giving him big losses and he lost a lot of money. also he started taking loan to trade stocks. after few years he was bankrupt and committed suicide.2) we all know about warren buffett and charlie mungers business partnership, but many people do not know that they had another business partner &amp; his name was rick guerin. buffett, munger and guerin used to take investment decisions together. buffett and munger always believed in slow and steady growths whereas guerin wanted to get rich quick, so he started trading in derivatives and he made a huge loss and to cover that loss he had to sell his entire stake of berkshire hathaway.there is only three ways a smart person can go broke: liquor, ladies and leverage - warren buffett ive noticed a lot of negativity over the years (lurker since 2017) regarding cardano. now i notice that its barely ever mentioned, and tbh i know people are scared to mention it due to the masses of downvotes that usually follow.but hey, its rare to see anything controversial in these moon times so i might as well stir the pot.seems like they finally caught up a lot of lost ground this year and the near future is also looking very promising. hoskinson also does very regular updates, more than anyone else in the space. im not going to go into detail for the rest because im not shilling.i want to hear everyones ideas on this. pros and cons.(pls have mercy on the downvotes yall) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i have some cryptos in coinbase. im holding bags as i bought them when they were higher and im just waiting for it to go back up. i havent keep any records of buys and sells and havent reported any of the crypto i have. am i gonna get in big trouble or can i just report it later on when its actually in profit?

UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// if bitcoin hits 12k from earlier today? * started watching the market in september, was waiting for a dip, didn't buy.* missed out on good ol' donald's corona shit thinking it would drop more than it would, didn't buy.* saw the market chill in the low 10k for weeks on end, didn't buy.now i just sit and watch thinking i'll keep missing opportunities if i don't buy right now. but, i don't want to buy right this second, because i feel like such an idiot missing out on the right times to purchase already. i keep thinking a larger dip is going to hit and just never does. i need to set an expectation price and purchase then, or just buckle up and commit. honestly i don't know what to do. heres the example scenario:- i buy 1 btc at $10,000 in a coinbase account owned by my personal name like brad henderson.- 3 months later, this 1 btc coin is now worth $40,000.- i now set up a different account at a crypto exchange. this account is owned by a business entity of mine like green revival llc.- i transfer the 1 btc from my personal account under brad henderson to my business account under green revival llc.the questiondo i have to pay any tax at any point here or am i free to simply shift the ownership of my coins like this?(btw i am the sole owner of this llc shitcoinnews.com bitcoin breaks $12,000 mark during record setting runhttps://coinstats.app/news/gacygee9of_bitcoin-breaks-12000-mark-during-record-setting-runvia @coinstats_ https://www.reddit.com/r/paxful/comments/jf2qik/scammed_on_paxful_for_300_in_google_play/should have used my better judgement but thought i would give it a shot selling some gift cards for some btc. do not do this! bitcoin hits $12k as its dominance surpasses 60 percent first time since augusthttps://coinstats.app/news/pt63nodbar_bitcoin-hits-12k-as-its-dominance-surpasses-60-percent-first-time-since-augustvia @coinstats_ i love bitcoin for many reasons but it feels like its too good to be true.  for this reason im always trying to find weaknesses in it.  i have an intermediate understanding of how its decentralized and how its security is maintained through collective computing mining/power.i read recently the world economic forum was preparing for the next era (i forget their exact word) and part of their plan involves internet governance.internet governance sounds like a bad thing for bitcoin.does anybody with a deep understanding of how the internet works know how internet governance can be leveraged, at least in theory, to weaken the bitcoin network?can the specific lanes and connections between bitcoin nodes be selectively shut down?  i understand the whack-a-mole game theory of it, where another node pops up to pick up where others got cut out, but could this be a long term threat to the greatest invention of this generation?central banks wont go down without a fight.see you at $100k as far as i can tell, there's no update and withdrawals have been suspended 5 days now.everything seems to be very calm despite this being a major exchange. is there some way for okex customers to cash out?

freelance kind of gigs or even by demand. i just figure others would probably benefit from different leads right now too and what not a better place to ask?*please if shitcoins don't waste your time, thanks* i'm out of ready money and find some guys help me, i have debit visa but now it is not work and exchange rate with cuba bank is too low and comission between 2 bank is too high. thank you so much. by the time we are aware of hyperinflation happening it is already too late. we saw expoential growth with covid19, where it went from 1 infecton to 100 infected, it took a long time, but to get from 100 to 10,000 happened much faster.&amp;#x200b;so think of it like this, it took awhile to get from 0.1% inflation up to 1% inflation this year, with trillions of dollars printed. it could jump from 1% inflation to 10% much faster. and then from 10% to 100% inflation faster too. exponetial growth is very hard to spot in the beginning, how do we know if this is the start of the parabolic hyperinflation curve? i just tryed exchanging my bitcoin to xmr and now my bitcoin stuck in unconfirmed transaction can some one please help if those running a bitcoin mixer can be charged for violating aml, can a centralized mining pool charged for mining a transaction violating sanctions?mining pools are relatively large organizations that control what transactions get into the block as they create the block template using the bitcoin protocol. thus they have 'ownership' of what transactions are processed. they outsource some of the pow hashing to 'asic' operators ( that are not responsible for selecting transactions )large organizations generate allot of revenue and hire multiple people and present a large target for law enforcement vs a random solo miner that mines a block every now then. they are more likely to be  compliant with requests to censor transactions to protect their 'reputation/business'this is, why protocols like better-hash needs to be widely adopted because, with better hash the pool is \_not\_ responsible for selecting transactions - all it will do is pool the rewards. individual miners in the pool can create their own block templates.  thus they are no longer asic operators as they need to run a full node to create the block template.i think betterhash will decentralize legal liabilities  of the mining pool. any point of centralization in bitcoin like a custodian mixing service is vulnerable to legal action. did you know that criminal activity makes up only a tiny fraction of the total bitcoin use?  yet, mainstream news outlets run with the story that btc is beloved by criminals and scammers, but largely ignored by others.time to debunk![https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/no-bitcoin-isnt-as-popular-with-criminals-as-previously-thought/](https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/no-bitcoin-isnt-as-popular-with-criminals-as-previously-thought/) https://share.cloutearn.co/headhoncho_p[quick money method ](https://share.cloutearn.co/headhoncho_p) as the price increases over the last 30 days i've noticed this pretty obvious stairway pattern. wondering if anyone has come across analysis explaining what these are. is it large purchases that cause them?&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/wpkmmtjdbbu51.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=102aafe5b2dfb06b387c8c08cb21b874d23e01e6 i was sent some money on exodus, couple hours ago, with 50 satoshi per byte and vbyte, and the sender had a fee of around $1.3the transcation is still not confirmed, usually the transcations i've done in the past even with a little less fee, they were still confirmed faster than this, any idea what is happening?

[removed] looking to consolidate information/suggestions on apps that allow widgets (android) for checking prices of btc and various alts/shitcoins.i recently upgraded to a new phone and left an app called "bitrift" behind on the old phone. the widgets on that app were far superior to anything else i've found, and that app was unpublished in january 2020.the ideal widget is:- available for majority of the top 100 coins- customizable for pairings (not simply btc:usd, eth:usd, but capable of btc:eth, doge:doge to make sure the doge doesn't lose value, etc)- customizable for quantity (value of a portfolio, heavy bag, light bag)- size and color options to make it discreet, clean, vibrant and eye-catching, or whatever tickles your fancy- ability to update pricing frequently for those with crypto addiction- customizable push-notification alerts for price actionso far, some of the attempts have shown $ premium to allow some of the above functions and most simply do not have those functions. in my opinion, any recurring charge subscription is not a viable choice.

[removed] [removed] first off i want to say ive been lurking in here for awhile and i actually learn from some of the posts. i had bought in at 11.8 a couple months ago hoping it would go up. it never did. so i was hoping it would get back to that or crack 12 which it did so i got out hoping to get back in at a lower price for the final ride up the ladder. maybe it will just keep going but im hoping it will slide back down around or after election time so i can buy in at a better price and then stay there forever. your thoughts on this amateur hour strategy are welcomed. thanks! im tired of selling bitcoin and paying a $30-40 fee, are there any better options with low to no fee to buy and sell? i've been playing around with `op_checklocktimeverify` (op_hodl) for the last few weeks since i haven't found it easy to do in many wallets.  eariler [i posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/jehmtn/more_fun_with_op_hodl_checklocktimeverify/) on using the coinbin wallet interface (locally) to do it, and before that [i posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/jawpsk/fun_with_op_hodl_checklocktimeverify/) a p2wsh [bitcoinlib script](https://github.com/brianddk/reddit/blob/f8e6798d80d60181715fa6babcfd4a1637a7190e/python/spend-p2sh-txout-tz.py) to do it.today i finally sat down and wrote a script using only electrum's api.  you can run it as any python script by having electrum installed from source.  or if your cavalier (and crazy) you can run it directly from the electrum console with the following command, assuming you put the script in `c:\temp`.```with open(r"c:\temp\elec-p2sh-hodl.py", 'r') as s: exec(s.read())```you should be noted, that one should ***never*** do this, since is effectively giving me control of your electrum wallet (bad).  it is coded to testnet if that is any consolation.the script is designed to recreate [txn a8110...adc93](https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/tx/a8110bbdd40d65351f615897d98c33cbe33e4ebedb4ba2fc9e8c644423dadc93/), but with electrum 4.0.4, the [r-value grinding](https://new.reddit.com/r/electrum/comments/jf97pc/weird_behavior_when_scripting_electrums/) causes the signature size to differ, causing signature malleability.  apparently coinbin and bitcoinlib haven't followed core when they made this change in 0.17.0.  txn is still valid, just with a different hash.if you want to spend a different op_hodl address, you can hopefully see the simple fields required to change. being told by [blockstream.info](https://blockstream.info) that your 211.7 sat/byte fee is overpaying by 89% kinda feels shit when you're on your third hour unconfirmed again for a high fee.it seems no matter how much a fee i put on, from 45, 90, 110, 211 etc; it always takes at least five hours.i think the whole thing is just bullshit tbh! i knew i had to give them my id, but apparently they're all like that. i tried using another bitcoin atm, made an account and gave them my id. they still haven't reviewed my account or whatever, even though it's been a day and they sent me an email. i can't keep driving out of town for this shit. the only bitcoin atm in my town is this coinstar shit and all the others are 30 minutes one way.i thought it would print out the actual bitcoin. i paid $140 for some voucher, and after all the hoops i have to jump through, i can only have it in their wallet? fuck this shit. i have far more important shit to do than waste my hard-earned money on receipt paper. i haven't heard a peep! :) with the bull market well under way, it got me to think at what price i would sell my bitcoins. i didn't sell my btc last time it hit 12k (only time it hit 12k for me as i didn't have bitcoins before that), and i'm certainly not selling now.what if you woke up tomorrow and bitcoin was at 25k? 50k? would you sell all or some of your bitcoins?for me, i think at the psychological barrier of $100,000 usd, i would sell half my bitcoins. i might sell 25% of my btc at $50k, but only with the hope that it would crash and i could buy back more later.at $250,000 per bitcoins i would sell everything i have.what about you? what's the magical price for you? is michael saylor right? how much of the volume is utxos and transactions when unspent amounts are sent back? is wash trading a significant problem? it's a worthwhile for him to raise. do an unannounced and unexpected proof of keys. pull it all out. you can jump back in later with whichever exchange doesn't choke or glitch. istead of having to deal with hackers or remembering some code and buying a nano ledger, i can just market buy it on robin hood, on robin hood hackers cannot steal your bitcoin because you cannot withdraw it, it is simple and easy and you dont have to woory about hackers unlike coinbase.99% of people dont care about muh keys ive had so many friends get into bitcoin simply to gamble it online. while that doesnt necessarily mean they are investing, they are still learning how to buy and sell. also with youtubers like nelk dropping thousands on roobet, i expect a gen z will be all over bitcoin. with paypal's announcement, the number of businesses that will accept bitcoin will go from 15,000 to 26,000,000 worldwide.that's almost hard to even wrap my head around.btc (and all its loyal supporters) has been fighting to convince business owners to accept bitcoin for the past almost 10 years and with one decision, the number of businesses accepting btc increases 1,733 times!in all the years i've been following btc, this news ranks, imo, as among the most powerful.for me, it's based on 2 factors:it may severely limit the ability for whales and traders to manipulate btc.it may finally "decouple" btc from the stock market.both of which i think have severely limited btc since late 2017. cash app has been randomly blocking transactions (i buy btc daily automatically) for no reason. everything was smooth until i started moving my btc off of cash app into a hard wallet out of fear they would lock me out of my bitcoin one day. lo and behold, after verifying twice, they have locked me from buying btc again. any alternatives to buy bitcoin nice and easier than cash app? soon it wont be btc users arguing with bch users it will be real crypto users against companies like paypal. it will be real crypto vs fake crypto thats just on paypals website screen most likely not even connected to a blockchain. a fascinating venture with incredible possibilities! a decent and certain beginning, a huge group that is keen on the quick and ground-breaking improvement of the venture.great workkingswap is a swapping platform this guy has been calling for massive drops for like over three months now, he has repeatedly been bearish posting the same video everyday with the exact same analysis and it isnt working, he has not made one right call in recent memory at all, he deletes peoples comments calling him out on his irresponsible technical analysis and laughs jokes and makes fun of people who are bullish with insanely negative and predatory jokes essentially calling them stupid. i felt that it was necessary to let everyone know about this guy and to make sure youre aware of his negligence because the last thing i want is new people who are just learning about bitcoin losing money because of this guy and then not knowing that hes terrible because he deletes all the bad comments, such a horrible and selfish thing to do and im so glad i didnt listen to him [removed] [removed] [https://dilcoin.medium.com/dil-coin-best-value-secure-coin-for-all-924dc9682d41](https://dilcoin.medium.com/dil-coin-best-value-secure-coin-for-all-924dc9682d41) &amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/j46r6dfvnhu51.png?width=3332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b74805fec2624e83e74f8c14d6ba9c5b694e845&amp;#x200b;*i saw this badass building on an ethereum virtual reality blockchain platform.  my jaw dropped, must have took him a few days to lay all those blocks.  you can check it out at* [*http://cryptovoxels.store*](http://cryptovoxels.store)&amp;#x200b;i think its w is walk a for sideways and f is to fly.  i'm still learnin' this thing.  theres also nft art we can buy but i think you need metamask.  this stuff is awesome man. i clicked on a link from twitter and wham from my internet browser virtual reality, this is the future. sorry guys and gals.i am new here.been watching bitcoin since like 2013 and never ever bought in.always seemed like it would just never really "take off", because it's so damn hard to actually buy things with it. and since bitcoin wasn't being used as a currency, but rather a speculative bet, it just seemed like a big bubble that i didn't want to be part of.the march dip didn't feel right. the august surge didn't feel right. just shied away all the time.anyways, i just wanted to apologize because as soon as i saw the paypal announcement (4 hours late to the party), i dumped about $10k in.and i have to say sorry because have like the worst luck in investing ever.since i bought in, she seems to have tapered out.it seems i have jinxed you all and i am sorry.sincerely,mr. bad luck bets.

[removed] didnt expect that today. way to go bitcoin!i always try to temper my expectations, but theres been so much good news lately...and with paypal dropping that out of nowhere... well its been a nice few days thats for sure.alts must be happy too! im seeing a lot of green out there. dont get caught up in fomo of course, i dont want any of you lovely people going in harder then you can afford. but hey, lets enjoy what we have going on today! that's it, i only wanted to say itfor newcomers and not so newcomers, last time a lot of people lost huge money quantities by taking loans or investing all their savings in a bull market. don't invest more than you can afford to lose, fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride throw a hundred bucks in there and let them have it. we want adoption and that is how you get it. paypal gets users buying coins from their platform and they continue to push marketing and adoption for us. keep what you actually want to use / hodl in your own wallets and watch the value grow bois [removed] [removed] [removed] i believe the bull run is starting. why? not only we saw a massive pump in btc in a matter of hours but the biggest indicators to me were an old friend of mine contacting me a couple of days ago asking how to buy btc and moon - yes that nobody heard about reddit moon!!!yesterday my uncle and another guy i know told me they just bought btc and eth.today my brother, which i have been telling him to invest since since 2016 and then made a huge reinforcement in march 2020, just told me "yep, today is the day, tell me how to invest again".all these people were completely offline of crypto world and somehow, somewhere something made them want to invest.my mom works in a bank and had two ladies in their 70s asking about bitcoin early this morning!this is insane. it's not too late yet!!!don't get demotivated by the price.happy ride fellow redditors!tl;dr: bull run is starting, dumb friend, family and poor brother wanted to invest in the last days. two old ladies went to my mom's workplace asking for bitcoin. so, as the title says above, do you think that governments will hold bitcoin similar to how they hold gold in the future? in the beginning, bitcoin was mostly bought by individuals and now companies are buying in. do you think governments will be next? the amount of money they could bring would be tremendous as national governments are in general, an order of magnitude larger than corporations. bitcoin could fill a similar role to gold as it will likely become more stable in the future. do you think this is likely to happen? why or why not? [removed] [removed] [removed] what i read in the news:"sell, buy and hold crypto on the paypal wallet"i think we can all agree that this information is "useless". however the more interesting things would be:1. will paypal allow us to hold the private key if we want.1.2. if not, are we able to transfer to a private wallet1.3. if not, will paypal hold private keys(or the trust they are working with) with the supply that will be circulating on paypal?1.3.1 or will they simply have a crypto-derivative that we can "trade" and they wouldnt own any crypto.is this information even out there? because that's what people claim. "speculate" would be the more appropriate term.if 1.3.1 would be the case that would be a fucking disaster for adoption(but not really a surprise) buy crypto stocks alongside your actual crypto, so you never need to sell your crypto for cheap gains. many of the miner stocks will pay dividends, go up 10x their current price, and continue to mine more coins. now that paypal is getting into business i'm thinking of actually investing a bit more into crypto. i've seen people on this sub recommending hardware wallets if people are actually serious about investing. can someone clear some things please up for me:should i use a hardware wallet? what about phone wallets and paper wallets?is my hardware wallet recoverable if i lose it/break it? which should i choose trezor/ledger?thanks a lot :) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] today, paypal announced that they will be launching a cryptocurrency digital wallet for buying, selling and storing bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin.this confirms rumors which circulated earlier this year, and it is seen as a significant milestone by many in the community.a milestone it may be, but it will impact millions of daily users who have, until now, never considered getting into cryptocurrency. for them, paypal will be the leading authority in a space that it has long sought to discredit.over 221 billion dollars were transacted in q2 of 2020 using paypal. that represents a rise of 10% in volume in just six months. paypal is growing and dominating online payments as well as other services such as credit and insurance.it has a long-established reputation of occasionally freezing user funds and censoring payments that conflict with its outlook but the payments giant continues to hold relevance where bitcoin should have long overtaken it. perhaps this news marks the beginning of a transition?is paypals announcement good news for bitcoin?until very recently, paypal was anti-crypto. writing in 2018, ex-ceo bill harris called bitcoin the greatest scam ever, so whats changed?this sudden turnaround is encouraging, especially as private companies like microstrategy and square make grandiose announcements about their own crypto diversification.should the community embrace them with open arms? after all, this is the start of mass adoption weve all been waiting for, right?when a household brand like paypal starts selling bitcoin, its probably not because they want to spur healthy adoption. in the press release announcing their new cryptocurrency service, paypal sends out mixed messages.on one hand, the service will be entirely custodial, meaning users will not have the key to their own coins, while on the other they intend to provide account holders with educational content to help them understand the cryptocurrency ecosystem. the idea that anyone informed about bitcoin would agree to not holding their private keys might indicate that this educational content will overlook the fundamental rule of not your keys; not your coins.if millions of newcomers are onboarded to bitcoin by paypal, there could be a very serious information gap that jeopardizes their experience and undermines key principles of cryptocurrency.this statement from their faq is, in practical terms, false: you own the cryptocurrency you buy on paypal but will not be provided with a private key. no-one should consider money held entirely by a third party as owned by them.time after time, exchanges have lost user funds, often leaving them with no recourse.a benefit for some will be a promise of greater regulation, where funds can be insured and new users may feel more comfortable than dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges directly, but they will be restricted from actually utilizing their coins. the only reasons to own bitcoin which cannot be used, would be to invest for the long term, which is incredibly reckless to do when your funds are held by a third party, or speculate on its price, which again, would be introducing the masses to financial mechanisms they do not understand.is paypal positioned to be a cryptocurrency leader?as it steps into the forefront, paypal will be closely watched by companies, institutions, and consumers. while they can boast of digital payments expertise, they have historically taken an aggressive stance against users who bought cryptocurrency on exchanges, citing their acceptable use policy, forbidding transactions which involve currency exchanges or check cashing businesses.the fact that this clause remains in their policy suggests that they intend to limit users to use only their platform for cryptocurrency, stifling competition and preventing users from ever withdrawing their cryptocurrency to the safety of a wallet they control the keys to. that said, there is something to be said for paypals statement that they will enable cryptocurrency as a funding source for digital commerce at its 26 million merchants. currently, the options for cryptocurrency funding are in their infancy, and bitcoin loans could see future growth.there is only one thing about paypals announcement that long-term hodlers will be celebrating today: the pump in price. long-term, if paypal proceeds without consulting the community and letting their users control their own keys, it offers no value to the space.the greatest risk is that the clout they carry in traditional electronic payments will be interpreted as expertise in crypto. this would threaten the expert advice so carefully crafted by our community, which could be drowned out by the misinformed masses that paypal brings to the space. for now, no-one can tell how it will turn out, but there are big concerns to address before informed users will turn to paypal.welcome paypals initiative with open arms, but by no means look to them for leadership. at best, this announcement indicates that they may fear sinking into irrelevance.**do not use paypal for bitcoin; there are many other places to buy crypto which will let you keep ownership of your coins. **paypal is conceding to bitcoin, and the many other aspirational, educational projects within the community should be highlighted to prevent newcomers from falling into a trap of trusting one of bitcoins greatest long-term adversaries.source : https://blog.trezor.io/why-you-should-not-use-paypal-for-bitcoin-f6e2d436ca96 [removed] [removed] &amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/kzipseog4iu51.png?width=1185&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b866c8ee3ca5b85395aafcc223f327cdfe22ac97with news of crypto-integration into paypal's ecosystem, bitcoin's marketcap has now successfully superseded that of verizon, salesforce, disney, netflix, coca cola, and bank of america.during this cycle, bitcoin will continue to overtake the market cap of major household name brands. what a time to be alive. [removed] so what exactly are current alternatives to eth on which dapps could be made more efficiently?it's been some time since etherum is here yet lots of times the network is congested with abysmal transaction speeds.i keep seeing eth killer tag for every new project every now and then and yet nothing comes out of it.we don't need an eth killer to be sure but need competition and also reduced transaction fees on the network (gas fee).so my question is if there is a project under progress, trying to effectively solve all these issues? when can we expect a real alternative? it's beginning to look a lot like christmas (2017)anyone else getting the feeling that bitcoin might be getting ready to do something big? could we be on our way to reach a new all-time high?this time things are a bit different though. last time it was the crypto enthusiasts and risk-takers who were stacked up for the bull run. this time it's large investors and financial institutions. isn't it an interesting turn of events where the same people who were screaming that bitcoin is a scam are now the ones loading up? looks like the bitcoin fomo has spread far and wide... from their [faq](https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/article/cryptocurrency-on-paypal-faq-faq4398):&gt;*can i transfer cryptocurrency into and out of paypal?*&gt;&gt;currently, you can only hold the cryptocurrency that you buy on paypal in your account. additionally, the cryptocurrency in your account cannot be transferred to other accounts on or off paypal.&amp;#x200b;&gt;*will i get a private key for the cryptocurrency i buy on paypal?*&gt;&gt;you own the cryptocurrency you buy on paypal but **will not be provided with a private key**. in case you are wondering, a private key is a person's secret code to access and manage their cryptocurrency. if lost, stolen, or even forgotten they can never get to their cryptocurrency again -- pretty risky in its own right. if you can log in to your paypal account, you will have access to cryptocurrency balance you hold.&gt;*can i use my crypto assets as a funding source to pay merchants?*&gt;&gt;no, users cannot use crypto as a funding instrument for commerce at this time, though this is planned for 2021.

[removed] [removed] tldr: paypal bullied me out of my life savings, and they won't hesitate to do the same to those who can't defend themselves.i know that this is a savvy community and that most people here already have access to cryptocurrency if they want it and have no need for paypal's watered down offerings. that said, we are the ones our communities will come to for advice on these matters and i think that despite all the fanfare surrounding paypal, and despite all the market gains we are seeing due to their move, its extremely important that we remember how incredibly shitty of a company paypal is.i stopped using them around 2012. around 2010 is when they first bankrupted me. i was still a student, and didn't have much in the way of cash reserves, but what i did have i kept in a traditional checking account. i tied this account to paypal so that i could sell some things on ebay. later that year, i went to make a purchase on my debit card and was declined. when i looked at my balance, i saw that paypal had made a penny perfect withdrawal 100% draining my bank account. they insisted that they would reverse the transaction, but never did. after weeks on the telephone, they mentioned that someone had all my personal information and was using that to continuously access my account. whether it was an employee or hacker, i still don't know. i closed the account, and my bank account and moved on when it was clear they had no intention of helping me.in 2012, i figured they must have worked out their issues, and i again tied my new bank account to paypal so that i could use ebay. same exact thing happens. about a year after using the service and forgetting about it, a paypal charge comes in clearing my bank account and causing overage fees. i got the same exact run around from customer service there. nobody would give me any information whatsoever, despite weeks of calling on the phone. eventually, they told me i was too high of a burden to be their customer and terminated my account, including access to any logs i had not exported. when i told them i needed this information to file my police report, they told me the information would be available only if i judge told them to hand it over - or in other words: "have fun taking this multibillion dollar company with a dedicated legal department to court, asshole."never again, and definitely not with crypto. they had the chance to help me, and wouldn't simply because doing so would confirm that they lost control of my banking information. with crpyto, i am sure they would just save time by sending a form letter explaining the immutability of the blockchain.if you have a paypal horror story of your own, feel free to share it here or at [http://www.screw-paypal.com/](http://www.screw-paypal.com/) where a great diversity of paypal screwups are on display.please please please, do not let your less knowledgeable friends use this terrible company. not your keys, not your crypto!/rant not much to add to the title really, but i am so grateful for whatever caused this pump.i found this sub on an old account and really got into crypto, so thanks lads.also this sub was the reason i got my 400 uni airdrop, so i would like to thank everyone who recommended uniswap and for people that educate the community.good luck with your investments lads and stay smart. every time i try to submit a comedy post i get this message:&gt;direct links to image or video posts are now considered low quality content on this subreddit and will be removed except for 4 posts in the top 25 posts. you may try to resubmit your post at a later time or post it as a comment in the daily discussion thread instead.right after i get this message my post says "sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/cryptocurrency.".how is a post supposed to get into the top 25 if it's immediately removed every time? do i have to constantly spam this subreddit with my post until one of them "sticks"?i understand there's a lot of low quality content getting submitted, but if a post follows the rules then shouldn't it be the community that decides what gets to the top and what doesn't? [removed] [removed] as you know, r/cryptocurrency is now being monetized through moons.even tho the mechanic behind the moon attribution seems to be complex, it appears that the r/cryptocurrency dynamic can be calculated :the last ratio that i saw was 1 upvote = 8 moons.and 1 moon = 0.03 $so we can conclude that 1 upvote = around 24 centswith the apparition of new platforms allowing us to exchange our moons for real cash (i.g. [kuyumcu](https://moon.nano.trade/)), it appears that a real race to farm moons has started.but, several posts stated that in general, people are more and more reticent to give their upvotes (now that they know that it has a value and that this simple upvote can give a stranger more moons than they have).in parallel, a simple research on google will lead you to tons of services offering you free reddit upvotes (in exchange of a registration, click on a ad etc.). i won't lie to you and admit that, few years ago, i already used for free such a service to get facebook upvotes. and it did work very well (1.2k upvotes in 2 hours on one of my post).are people able to use those services?and this hypothesis seems to be comforted by some observations that i had : we can see everyday on reddit posts making it to hot then best in few hours and getting overall more than 1.5k uptvotes.so i was wondering : are all those upvotes real? how reddit is dealing with those services providing free upvotes?thanks for the answer.tl;dr : 1 upvote = 24 cents. online services provide free reddit upvotes. how reddit deals with that? [removed] the message i get is thay 'due to security reasons' i am not able to send money directly to coinbase. probably a scamming 'protection' i didn't ask for.i can probably go to my bank to explain i really want to send, and that i'm pretty sure i'm not being scammed. but i don't really like explaining them that i am into crypto and all (which they probably know when i send to coinbase in the first place).so i was wondering if there's a way to transfer money to coinbase without me having to ask my bank for permission. or are there maybe alternative ways to get btc/eth with fiat? [removed] so i keep seeing comments mostly on youtube on how bitcoin/ethereum/xrp have a maximum possible price, price targets, you know - usual prediction shit and all that.but i'm curious about one thing - when bitcoin hits like...let's say 1 to 10 million, ethereum hits 10k, xrp hitting...well, you get the point. my thing is, when crypto hits a certain price target, does it just stop growing? get less volatile? fizzle out and possibly permanently settle at a certain price point?i'm not trying to be a dumbass guys, it just boggles my mind that a asset can hit a certain price and just stop growing. i'm well aware that there's only so much money in the world, but surely btc/eth/coin/token of your choice would keep growing, albeit at a slower pace? i'm not hyping up this garbage. they seem to be explicitly removing the word, "withdraw" from their language. that's right. paypal will own your cryptocurrency, and you'll never be able to withdraw it from a private wallet.&amp;#x200b;don't hype up their bullshit. they're just a cog in the wheel of the regulated illusion of financial freedom, trying to leech off real, public, private money. don't hype them up. when family and friends ask about it, explain to them how private wallets work and what the point of all of this is.&amp;#x200b;paypal is not "good" for the environment. paypal is only "good" for their investors and daddy bankers.\#fuckpaypal. i work at a large national bank. recently, i've received several calls involving the purchase of cryptocurrency. even more recently, like 2 minutes ago, i performed a wire for a woman frantically trying to get her money to kraken.all this is to say: prepare yourselves, boys and girls. strap on on your dildo shaped rockets and cast aside any doubts, our time to dump is near. every second f****** post is about those paypal news bruhhhokay, papa elon said stonks go up, we got this.how can the mods delete some high quality memes and let this going on the whole day? i can't believe. so, please stop posting same posts 1000 times. i know we all like to get moons, but please don't shit where you eat. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] when the first distribution happened did they count karma in the subreddit since the account creation or only from the time were moon introduced in 2020?i tried to search for an answer but couldn't find any. i looked into the first round thread but couldn't find my username there but i did receive some moons afterwards so when did they start counting moon for users? was it may 2020 or jun 2020 or beginning of year or some other rule? [removed] [removed] focus on the [defi](https://cryptoadventure.org/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-finance-or-defi/)  space is shifting immensely following the invention of numerous digital  assets and other crypto-related projects. both new and expert traders  come onboard the defi community with high hopes of earning a good  income.however, most of  these protocols are usually fungible. in simple terms, fungible assets  can be exchanged with another user as long as both assets are similar.  crypto bonds, on the other hand, are non-fungible tokens that run on  sync network. before looking into the functionalities of [crypto bonds,](https://syncbond.com/) we have to understand what non-fungible assets are to get the bigger picture.## a brief description of non-fungible tokensunlike fungible assets, [non-fungible assets (nft)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-fungible_token) eliminate the exchange of any token or cryptocurrency. nfts mostly contain some information indicated on their [smart contracts](https://cryptoadventure.org/smart-contracts-behind-the-scenes/),  making them very different from each other. therefore, no single token  can represent the nft. among the identifiable information contained in  the smart contracts include stuff like secure file links and even the  owners identity.revealing  identities may seem far-fetched, but in the end, it plays a significant  role in the proof of ownership. the gaming industry is an excellent  example of an area that utilizes nft. items available on the gaming site  represent non-fungible tokens, so the rightful token owner must  purchase the items. other use cases for nfts may evolve around issuing  documents such as software licenses or birth certificates.## the birth of crypto bonds on sync networkthe  dawn of a new asset is here with sync network launching its own crypto  bond. sync network requires users to add 50% sync tokens to every crypto  bond. this measure ensures the maintenance of the tokens status as  well as improving their liquidity pools. sync is set to be paired with  over 150 different liquidity pairs. syncs bonding to other crypto  assets strengthens sync while supporting its assets bonded to via  liquidity pools. since crypto bonds fall under the nft bracket, anyone  can develop a bond for themselves. theres no need for a middle man.  generally, sync network empowers the crypto spaces growth through [blockchain adoption](https://cryptoadventure.org/12-countries-set-to-dominate-blockchain-industry-reveals-pwc-report/), safeguarding users wallets, and integrating research markets.## features of crypto bondsa unique [erc-721](https://cryptoadventure.org/beginners-guide-to-token-standards-ethereum-neo-tron/)  contract drives crypto bonds. so when formulating a new nft bond, one  has to seal an adequate amount of sync tokens and liquidity tokens from [uniswap.](https://cryptoadventure.org/uniswap-exchange-the-ultimate-guide-for-beginners/)  the lock duration entirely depends on the decision of an investor.  crypto bond durations range from 90 days to 3 years. choose between  quarterly dividend payouts or earn higher interest with a term crypto  bond. dividends are paid out in the form of sync tokens.token distribution of sync is divided into various sections whereby  48.7% goes to the public users, 25% is meant to sustain the crypto bond  market, partnership and marketing funds consume 16%, the developing team  gets 7%. private sale amounts to 2.5% of the total tokens. that being  said, crypto bonds enable a couple of distinguishing features,  including:### improves longevitysync tokens are scraped off the cumulative supply after the creation of a crypto bond. this action alone ensures [sync tokens](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputcurrency=0xb6ff96b8a8d214544ca0dbc9b33f7ad6503efd32)  remain scarce and highly valid to the crypto market. after that, a  re-minting procedure of the sync token and interests gained starts once  the crypto bond maturity lapses.### adjustable interestcrypto bonds interest rates keep changing daily to keep up with the demand for sync tokens current supply.### effective tradingusers can trade their crypto bonds on the automated bond market maker or through auctions. utilizing [bot technology for trading](https://cryptoadventure.org/what-are-cryptocurrency-trading-bots-and-why-we-need-them/) purposes saves an investors most important resources, time, and funds.### easiness of transferthe sync network facilitates an easy mechanism of sending crypto bonds to other [wallets](https://cryptoadventure.org/wallets/).### liquidity maintenancecrypto  bonds boost the liquidity structures of every pool that associates with  it. liquidity withdrawal is possible only after the maturity period  comes to an end.## why you should choose sync networksync network is undoubtedly one of the modernized [defi projects](https://cryptoadventure.org/defi-platforms/)  in the market today. it increases the liquidity power of specific pools  through the crypto bonds. it also deploys a strategy meant to elevate  the sync token in conjunction with their respective pools.sync  network also allows users to design the crypto bonds according to their  individual preferences. the networks automated bond market maker  executes the bonds immediate sale on behalf of a user.assets  with higher chances of gaining more interests are traded together,  thanks to the crypto bond marketplace. whether or not you decide to  trade on a different market is also your choice; however, it wont  interfere with an assets price linked with crypto bonds.## conclusionsync  network seemingly carries the massive potential to serve its users  comfortably. it isnt possible to trade all day even though the crypto  market operates full time. nonetheless, merging crypto bonds with defi  allows for a robust secondary market that aims to support the crypto  market as a whole. the direct effect of crypto bonds being created is  larger, stronger, and more liquid markets.moreover,  it will be difficult for sync tokens to lose its value considering the  effective strategies to ensure its stability. the network also enables [ren protocol](https://cryptoadventure.org/investing-in-republic-protocol-ren-here-is-what-you-need-to-know/)  procedures, which facilitate the transfer of assets across other  chains. sync network is consistent with its plans, which is why, moving  forward, it plans to establish a decentralized crypto bond trading  platform. [removed] so apparently you won't be able to purchase actual crypto nor withdraw it from your paypal account. when asked *can i transfer crypto into and out of paypal?* they gave the following answer: *currently you can only hold the cryptocurrencies that you buy on paypal in your account. additionally, the crypto in your account cannot be transfered to other accounts on or off paypal* **(link to the source in the comments)**.so correct me if i'm wrong, but as i see it, you wont get an actual btc for 12,7 k usd (atm) in your paypal account. those are only going to be empty numbers supposedly backed by crypto at their custodial. sort of on the contrary to what tether is doing (just this time it might actually be backed, lol). so if you buy something for half a bitcoin, they'll sell that btc from their custodial, and will change the numbers of you btc balance lolthen of course you can't transfer those outside their network, nor trade it for other crypto on paypal.while it is still very early, and they'll probably expand the functionalities incrementally, being the big corp, they should have communicated way clearer. what's your take on that?

usually, bull markets attract a lot of new investors - although speculators should be the right word here - and as usual, a lot of them are going to be crushed a way or another.first, before putting a single dollar, euro or whatever in the market, you should read a lot to know exactly what you're looking for.are you here for the tech and/or the cypherpunk ethos ?

(yes, i know, some will say accumulating ethereum or something else). it's true that a lot of ethereum holders made a lot of money during the last bullrun (ethereum helped me make money too) but i'm really biased in favor of bitcoin (and monero). so, pick your coin but again, do your due diligence.a lot of people here or there will talk about the best tech, the fact that bitcoin is old and slow. i would need another post to go further on this point but know that a lof of air flight systems are old too but reliable. trustless and reliable is the point here.this is the post from someone who bought bitcoin seven or six years ago, who lost part of them, who spent part of them (but don't regret this at all), who is still learning and i hope it will help others, although it would need a book to be complete.

[removed] [removed] hi, my name is jarvis cerkan. im a little into bitcoin and i am obsessed with it. bitcoin just passed 12,000$  and i now wonder, wether it will rise furtheror not. i am going to donate 20 moon to people who really give great advice to me about bitcoin. thank you!best,jarvis cerkan [removed] [removed] recently i was approached by  a guy in the direct messages, namely u/freetheorange905 . he tried to buy moons off me for above market price which i thought was sketchy. so i agreed to the deal to see where it would go. he then asked for my eth adress to "send payment" which i was already skeptical of. he wanted to buy all of my moons that i had left. i previously sold it for nano which was quite simple so i had no need to sell it to a random person in the direct messages. he then asked me to send moons first before he sent payment. a huge red flag. i send a small amount just to test him as a small amount of moons isn't worth much. he then vanished and never replied... as expected. so please. stay away from scammers in the direct messages and rather sell through honey or kuyumcu.if this helps anyone i will be glad.stay safe and happy hodling [removed] i brought some btc on cex.io a while ago and recently wanted to get some more but the site no longer appears to working so i'm trying to find a different one but they all require me to be 18 and show proof of that which i am not.a site i could buy xmr with gbp would be ideal but the only non crypto currency xmr ever seems to be related to is usd so a place where i can get btc or any other currency that can be easily converted to xmr would also be appreciated [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] with all the latest news and going ons, i came to the conclusion that in the future there might be a backlash against power hungry coins like bitcoin resulting in some national tax being levied on bitcoin transactions (dont worry too much about this , its just to explain where my mind was going).so i thought this might mean litecoin would be a good long term investment as ive heard its more energy efficient. i did some googling and found this well written article:https://www.ofnumbers.com/2018/08/26/how-much-electricity-is-consumed-by-bitcoin-bitcoin-cash-ethereum-litecoin-and-monero/i was surprised to find litecoin , isnt that much more energy efficient , due to the fact miners still end up using asic machines.the article finishes by addressing some of the common counter arguments such as traditional systems also consume a lot of energy, and use of green energy. i strongly recommend reading it if you want to comment about those.it does however focus on the energy cost after a coin or fiat has been created (i.e. cost of transactions and storage) and not the cost of producing the fiat. but cost of production is one one off cost anyway.and it does not mention gold (which i imagine has a high production cost but cheaper transaction+storage costs vs. btc).anyway thought id get the communities thought on all of this. i know a lot of us are emotionally attached to crypto and will rush to defend it but i im trying to anticipate if there might be a backlash in the future and if so which coins might be a good investment.im curious to see how the author would rate nano, which is kind of the conclusion im reaching here (all the nano shillers ive been deriding will rejoice to hear this)thoughts? [removed] [removed] [removed] what is your experience with defi?i find it interesting to read about yield farming, locking up coins for interest and defi. but some of these things sound like they are too good to be true.is it something you can recommend trying out, or is it risky, complicated,...? what have you done with defi and what is your experience? i have zero experience coding but i'm interested in creating a btcpay server for my company so i can accept bitcoin as payment. is it worth going through the hassle of learning everything to create the server or will it be too much for someone who has no experience in coding?thanks.

[removed] [removed] hi everyone!&amp;#x200b;i'm working on a youtube series where i build a bitcoin miner on an fpga from scratch.&amp;#x200b;i just published the first video in the crypto series playlist where i provide a high level overview of the technical details we need to understand to build crypto mining software.&amp;#x200b;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s0f5f7z2zm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s0f5f7z2zm) [https://twitter.com/cryptowhale/status/1319365339126386690/photo/1](https://twitter.com/cryptowhale/status/1319365339126386690/photo/1)https://preview.redd.it/1sff0fk5cqu51.jpg?width=1106&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1d16fe02baa3e9d328ffe60ed54b9de1442463e i dont see the reasoning behind selling... this is a p2p market so stop selling cheap and make bitcoin great again. i have mixed feelings, i already have bitcoin but want to buy soon too lmao so i have no clue what to cheer for lol remember, it got us to 19k last time. i want to invest and i believe im time in the market over timing the market but with no real knowledge of bitcoin idk if i should wait for it to drop again or buy right now the following question came to my mind a few days ago.paypal offers soon the ability to buy / sell and store btc and also to pay with bitcoin in ~ 25 million shops that are using paypal. (first usa residents only, but soon other countries probably aswell)couldn't this possible lead to a huge amount of new daily transaction and has a significant effect on the mempool?because you could suddenly pay in alot of shops with bitcoin that didn't offered it before.what happens if the amount of transaction increases rapidly?this will lead to alot of new unconfirmed transactions on the mempool and therefore to huge transactions fees probably.we already have right now transaction fees of 4,27$ for a medium priority.am i missing something, or could this be actually a bad side effect? while the bitcoin bull does not give a timeframe when this is likely to happen, i believes that, thanks to relentless government money printing, the benchmark cryptocurrency will eventually test $100,000. but not before some correction.$28,000 is in play before we see a pullback  and then were heading to 6-figures, keiser forecast, in the course of several tweets.bitcoin (btc) soared more than 20% to hit $11,300 on july 28, its highest level since august 2019. the top crypto has struggled to break above the key $10,000 point since the may 11 halving, but made easy of the resistance level in the last 48 hours.the rally comes as the u.s. government this week announced another round of stimulus spending, a $1 trillion package, that will also finance covid-19 cushioning allowances paid out to american families at the rate of $1,200.the last time bitcoin rose above $10,000 was in may, and it only fell by 15%. its above $13.000  today. how big will the next drop be?schiff is puking his brains out right now, regretting his gold purchase.regarding the relative accessibility of bitcoin over gold, i have been saying for over a year that silver and gold will be difficult to source and the market will shift to bitcoin as hard money substitutes, and those who never thought of buying btc will be forced to.gold and bitcoin are usually paired as safe investment havens. bitcoins finite money compares favorably to fiat currency. with the u.s dollar weakening, as the government doles out free money, the distinction comes into focus. id just like to start with stating that i understand no one here knows what will happen with btc. it can either continue going up or will get dumped out of no where. so basically, i invested 10k in knc and my loss on that investment is around 2k. i haven't sold the knc yet but if i were to, i would take a 2k hit.  i was just wondering if you were me, would you just trade the 8k value in knc for btc? im just worried that if i do that and a bunch of whales start selling btc, i'm going to lose another few thousand on top of my initial knc investment. im kind of leaning towards doing the trade because btc is more reliable but i was wondering what others think. so i've been trying to purchase more bitcoin today but mastercard just flagged every place i tried and it's looking like my bank is doing the same... no confirmation on payment from anywhere as of yet... anyone else??? [removed] i need a bitcoin wallet to start off with bitcoin. i would like one where it is on android, and on a web browser. i figured here is the best place to know which one i should get. got any suggestion? and it is the only cryptocurrency to get this privilege its pretty easy to tell from the title. is there a country where bitcoin laundering is legal? i'm reading up on various altcoins, and coins like stellar and eos all seemingly offer faster transfers and no transaction fee's. does btc have any advantages that make up for that? eos seem to argue that their currency is great for microtransaction, but is there any reason why it's not as great for larger transactions?is btc's dominance simply due to the name and branding?thanks! so my landlord recently got introduced to 'kok play' - a korean crypto company (?).i personally dont touch cypto no more after i had my highs back in 2018 - but my landlord insists this one is not a scam and many people hold these coins have made so much money via interest.this is their website: [https://kok-play.io/kok/?lang=en](https://kok-play.io/kok/?lang=en)i don't understand their whitepaper at all but this just seems like a crypto-mlm type scheme. can someone chime in on this so i can potentially save my landlord's bank account and get her to stop bothering me with this? i am looking for the best online white paper directories where one can submit their white paper for distribution on the site. i just bought my first btc, it arrived in electrum wallet and the transaction pretty quickly confirmed. now, i wanted to turn it into monero, so i sent some to morphtoken, and im now waiting for confirmation. i payed the lowest possible fee (1 sat/byte, i believe), and its been an hour. morphtoken still says the transfer is unconfirmed. also, if it matters, the transactions position in mempool is 37.64 mb from tip, but not entirely sure what that means. how long should i expect this to take? hello! kinda new to crypto. i have a sum of xmr ive been watching..with the rise of btc im tempted to throw it into bitcoin instead. do i make the exchange now with the rise? or do i wait? so this paypal news at best caused btc price to increase around $1k. that means even such huge company did not have much effects on price.its like that cartoon that "give me soul  and i get bigger! this would seem to make sense based on the general pattern of the graph of bitcoin stock value. i think i will wait until next year before purchasing. anyone have any good insights? please do not trust any pretty chinese girls on tinder that are asking you to invest in cryptocurrency. there is an old post about this over a year ago by bastian74 but it won't let me post to it.characteristics of scam.1.match on tinder with a very pretty chinese girl however after a few short messages they will ask for a phone number to talk more privetly. they might then 'unmatch' you on tinder.2.they play the long game - weeks, a month or even a few months to lure the mark in.3. they always say they will be visiting or heading back to the country of origin of the mark.4. they tend to be from hong kong5. they invest in cryptocurrency6.they always have insider information about said currency.do not, under any circumstances give out any detailed financial information nor take their advice.this post is to raise awareness that these scams exsist and save people from losing money. can someone send me $1 in bitcoin. i just want to know if my btc wallet is recieving any payment or not. it's not a scam or anything i just want to check it.send it at:1gcxputupxdws8r43xqkhfdhrifqf58jzamuch appreciated if you do so.i'll send it back to you.

[removed] the value of bitcoin has gone up since i bought some yesterday and yet the gbp value of mine has gone down. do bitcoin.com overprice their bitcoin or something? trying to work out how ive lost money when the value has done nothing but gone up since i bought them! i got in around 6k, but bought 100$ a week, and using it like a bank has given me a freedom ive never felt to make decisions, ive made a lot of money buying low altcloins for 100$ and watching them casually, and i just wanted to thank you guys for keeping the energy going of this money movement, its really nice, even when i see it down i just get excited, i really dont care if everyone sells high on this run, ill keep buying. thanks btc totally newbie right here.did you guys think is gonna have a dip before reach 15,000?or as a new buyer, it's the right time? btc is now over 13k and i've been slowly selling off because i expect it to go back down below 13k. obviously i'm only selling off a tiny fraction and hodling the rest for the long long long term. i sold some at 12.4k, then 12.7k, then 12.9k now 13k [removed] media talking about "new technology" called bitcoin again in 3, 2, 1...... last week i was passing by the living room and guess what, she was watching the documentary about btc in africa. i didnt say shit, so after she finished watching she just said its like a payment system.today she fomod and bought some for the first time.as another user posted here, lets keep the bears in their fucking cages.its happening sooner than later. goddamn was it hard but finally i made it. here's the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/buttcoin/comments/jfqgfe/buttcoin_is_an_incredible_scam/).it is still much more constructive to argue with them than in r/technology, r/economics or even r/futurology which brings its own sense of irony.i am happy with what i got out of it, i think i understand their position better.they are quite knowledgeable about some technical aspects and imo wrong only in certain implications.but riddle me this:*rule 5. i suggest you go read it before one of us adults has to give you a time out.**actually reading more of your posts in here, it's getting enforced now.**off you fuck.*\- r/buttcoin adminanyone knows what is the rule number 5 there? i only see 4. am i being trolled rn? a few reflections from this morning as we head into the next bull run.mr warren buffett doesn't get along well with us hodlers, but its worth taking a page from his life. 81 billion of his 85 billion net worth came after his 65th birthday. he did this by being long term right.i've spent over 5 years hodling and accumulating and continue to apply the following ideologies which i wanted to share with everyone:1. live frugal, don't spend more than you earn.2. stack sats regularly, ignore the market volatility.3. focus on fundamentals, learn the technology, run it, ask questions and build a community4. sell when you want to invest in yourself, your family &amp; your happiness. buy freedom, buy family wealth, buy long term joy &amp; memories5. never stop buying https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/jbmu36/20m_thinking_about_using_my_bitcoin_wallet_as_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf i thought the whole point of bitcoin was to replace the need for 3rd party transaction processing and allow trustless peer-to-peer transactions without the need of any middleman taking a cut or controlling things.   how is paypal being in the game a good thing? bitcoin is supposed to make paypal obsolete.  to me this is not really beneficial and really counter intuitive. it makes bitcoin seem like a "thing" that gets transferred by a third party rather than actually being the network for facilitating transactions. ###status of the bitcoin network as of thursday, october 22, 2020 at 12:00:01 est:**total bitcoins:** 18,523,996.044971**height:** 653,852**difficulty:** 19,997,335,994,446.109375######statistics for the past 24 hours:**number of blocks mined:** 138**total bitcoins output (amount sent):** 3,967,120.903250**total fees:** 165.676414**average time until block found:** 10 minutes, 26 seconds**estimated hashrate:** 137,182,069,006.118011 gh/s**current price:** us$12,948.73*data provided by [smartbit.com.au](https://www.smartbit.com.au). price data provided by [coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com).****^^i ^^am ^^a ^^bot. **[^^my ^^commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/3an2c4/ive_been_working_on_a_bot_for_crypto_subs_like/)** ^^| ^^*/r/crypto_bot* ^^| [^^message ^^my ^^creator](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=busterroni) ^^| [^^source ^^code](https://github.com/busterroni/crypto_bot) pro tip:1) scroll to the bottom2) mark it not helpful3) click "other"4) bitch about lies for 100 chars hey btc. i started stacking sats a wee while ago, read up a bit and got myself a cold storage wallet on bitaddress, so i could start calling myself a real hodler.not entirely sure why but it has taken until now for me to realise, i don't know the best way to transfer funds out of my cold storage to another wallet, e.g to transfer to a friend's wallet.i looked on the faqs here to find out, and saw a few things i'd like clarification on:- under "why does my bitcoin address keep changing", it mentions it may be bad practice to use the same wallet for more than one transaction and that a wallet's address may change after each transaction. why?- what's the best way for me to transfer money from my cold storage?cheers! i'm from south africa, and it is soo easy to get bitcoin, we have an exchange called luno, all you do is, you transfer money from your checking account, to your luno account, and boom, you can trade fiat for bitcoin with no fees!and when you transfer from your luno account to your trezor, it's instant, and the fees are very low!are there restrictions in other parts of the world?

its like im blocked on every app and all my accounts are frozen, but i am fully verified and have high level accounts that never had problems.i tried to get verified on cashapp, i sent in my identification weeks ago. the app still says: pending verification we will email you in 24 hours, but it has been weeks! does anybody know what is going on? thanks a lot for any responsefor example: when i go to buy on coinbase, it goes through all the normal steps of purchasing, but just does not go through. its like my accounts are invisible or frozen. no support has gotten back to me after multiple tries, is it because of the pandemic? this is yet one more opinion on the news.i'll start by prefacing that when i first heard of bitcoin many years ago, my first thought was "i already have a paypal account to buy stuff online, why do i need that bitcoin account"i failed to understand then that bitcoin was a currency, not just a transfer protocol. i failed to understand you can store bitcoin long-term.and this lack of knowledge will now be repeated by all new bitcoin users that paypal onboards. by keeping users locked down to their platform and not allowing them to withdraw the coins, paypal will give the illusion that this is how it works. that this is normal, and the correct way. whereas it's the opposite.some users will research more and hopefully realize on their own that there are alternatives, that you need to have the ability to take possession of your bitcoin, as opposed to a gold etf or an oil etf. bitcoin is fully digital; taking possession of your coins and ensuring that the big players are not running a fractional reserve bitcoin game is of the utmost importance - and magnitudes easier then storing a barrel of oil.the majority will however remain content with the way paypal operates due to their inherent trust in the platform and that paypal must know what's best for them.overall this news should help shake off those nocoiner claims that bitcoin is just beanie babies. so the perception in the general population will gain some legitimacy, but we must remain vigilant and we must explain to the newcomers that there's "real" bitcoin (that you can take possession) and "paper" bitcoin (that's just some number in a centralized database)paypal needs to add btc withdrawals in order to be a legitimate player. this should be a fundamental requirement for any platform claiming to be a cryptocurrency hub. i know this sounds like a dumb idea, but im going ahead regardless. ive been in the community since 2017 and ive been dca for a while... i want a significantly larger position though. any place i can get a personal loan of $50k to $100k that lets me put that on crypto? lets just say hypothetically btc goes to $1m+ a coin and people start making some serious money... what are the best exchanges to sell on and transfer money, securely, to your bank account?! (ie - the funds will arrive there, wont get stopped by your bank, etc).personally im based in the uk so would be good to hear options for here, but also interested for other locations around the world.personally, im undecided but im not really a fan of coinbase anymore due to all the bad press.

[removed] [removed] hello, i had a a few bitcoins, and i stored them on a wallet on my pc. but i can not find the software on my pc anymore and do not know the name of the software.i know my btc adress and i know my password. do you know a way to get my access to my saldo?thanksnevzat tl;dr qbtc.u does not move in 1:1 correlation with bitcoin; volume of qbtc.u is terribly low, and its price has actually moved counter to bitcoin; you are charged using qbtc.u through "decay"; it's worth being suspicious enough of qbtc.u to just buy real bitcoin.\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------i have held qbtc.u for nearly 2 months, at my own mistake of failing to do my due diligence, and have learned a few things i'd like to share:1) do not expect price action to move in exact correlation to real bitcoin. for example, if bitcoin goes up 5% in a day, do not expect qbtc.u to go up 5%, as well. more often than not, it will usually go up a fraction of what bitcoin goes up.2) volume on qbtc.u is terribly low. many a time, when bitcoin has gone up, qbtc.u has actually gone down, or remained the same.3) most importantly, you should know there is a significant cost associated with buying qbtc.u which is charged to you through "decay". this is not disclosed by them. so, the longer you hold qbtc.u, the longer you are paying their fund through decay.to illustrate an example of how "decay" affects you, it would be as follows; let us say that on a day where bitcoin costs $10,000 cad, you purchase qbtc.u at a share price of $10 cad/share. then, say that the price of bitcoin falls to $5,000 cad, which should \*loosely\* mean qbtc.u falls to a share price of $5 cad/share. so, you end up deciding to hold qbtc.u until bitcoin goes back up to $10,000 cad, to break even. well, when bitcoin goes back up to $10,000 cad, qbtc.u should go back up to $10 cad/share, too, right? wrong. your qbtc.u shares will only go up to $8 or $9 cad/share, which means you now have to wait until bitcoin goes to $11,000 or $12,000 cad, just so that you can break even at $10 cad/share.4) lastly, it's worth being skeptical of qbtc.u, as i'm personally not inspired with any confidence in its integrity. as far as i'm concerned, they can just disappear from the market any day and all your money would be gone.long story short, if you're interested in investing/trading bitcoin, then just buy real bitcoin. i hope this helps some people. cheers! hello everybody,is this the right place to post questions related to btc trading or is there another sub for that?thanks so paypal doing some btc publicity stunt is fine and all but what about the reality that especially western governments are forcing crypto onramps to disable withdrawals? what if your bitcoin on your private key that you control is not the right kind of bitcoin because its not system approved? hi,what will the whales do? we like that they get onboard because they soak up coins and bring publicity. but it's a double-sided blowhole because they might squash breakouts in order to accumulate at lower prices. on the other hand, they don't want to spoil the reputation of bitcoin by manpulating too conspicuously. so my guess is that they will squash breakouts, but not created extreme 1,000 point dumps. consequently, breakouts like yesterday will be followed by 500 point falls, followed by long extended sideways ranges until the next breakout. of course, the would like bad macro news too, because all markets could fall, leading to accumulation at even lower prices. that's my suspicion. what do you think the whales will do? why can they and why can't the general public do so. my understanding is banking as we know today started as goldsmiths lending out claim checks. so, why on earth do we have to oblige to the system? whats the advantage? paypal won't let u take btc off the platform so why would using it on the platform make a difference? please utilize this sticky thread for all general **bitcoin** discussions! if you see posts on the front page or /r/bitcoin/new which are better suited for this daily discussion thread, please help out by directing the op to this thread instead. thank you!if you don't get an answer to your question, you can try phrasing it differently or commenting again tomorrow.[join us in the r/bitcoin chatroom!](https://s.reddit.com/channel/872992_7f67f22e296c2f65bd39f5af98f30a96b5e3e21e)please check the [previous discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/jf81tp/daily_discussion_october_21_2020/) for unanswered questions.

[removed] [removed] [removed] robbed by oceanex and they are not even acknowledging it, im usually more careful but i put too much trust in an exchange. heres what happened.out of nowhere i got locked out of my account one day trying to login. online form said that my password was wrong but thats impossible. i have it written down and it hasnt changed for some time. that shouldnt be a problem anyway because i have 2fa enabled on a device that doesnt even connect to the internet. so i go through kyc again to gain access to my account, after it finally was approved i can login again but behold, my account is empty. i had a little bit of btc in there and a ton of vtho. i follow the address on blockchain explorer and it clearly shows that the vtho was deposited in the oceanex account after i got locked out. after contacting oceanex about this they said that i should have a strong password and 2fa enabled which in fact i did. it would be impossible for anyone to login to my account so the funds were clearly moved from within oceanex, who else would deposit funds into an oceanex account anyway. please dont keep anything on that exchange or any really. i have been a vechain loyalist since ven days but have lost some faith because they are partnered with these thieves. i answered a comment, and thought that it carried over enough relevance to be heard by more people. i thought that i'd share it on a separate topic so more ears can get an idea of the problem and how we might go about fixing it.&amp;#x200b;moons are a fun way to be incentivized with. you recieve 'moons' for posting and getting upvoted.  every once in a while you get a decent spike, but this causes a certain type of group to start farming those tokens by recycling low-tier memes, sharing generic media attention and other useless things. this is going to gradually lead towards a lower and lower quality sub until the posts are fully alligned with the average intelligence (not a pretty sight if you ask me!). the intention of moons was clearly to bring up the quality, which is interesting and clearly there's some untapped potential, but there is a problem with the fundamental design.&amp;#x200b;i've noticed that putting effort into posts (like this), generally does not pay off. posting untapped information generally won't pay off unless it's something extremely bullish, which kind of speaks for itself; moons will in this regard just increase the irrationality to the point we had in 2017. it also feels dishonest to post like that as you're generally forced to lie about the state of a cryptocurrency for upvotes.&amp;#x200b;the problem arrives when higher quality topics are ignored. i've for instance seen various, intricate posts about new and interesting business-ideas be lost in the sea of spongebob-memes. the problem isn't that high quality posts exist, because i believe they do:the fundamental problem is that we have a democracy over here, and when everyone is given 1 vote, the herd upvotes memes over intelligence, they also might downvote controversial projects because it hurt their feelings. this sub needs to start adhering towards meritocracy over democracy if they plan to make sure that the intelligence keeps a certain threshold. we've seen in politics how over and over again, the politicians that can speak the longest &amp; loudest are generally the ones getting the position.&amp;#x200b;the solution is simply to have some kind centralization (probably the mods) for a while to make sure that the higher quality posts are passed through and be given extra exposure. as time progresses, those posters are given power (a reputation system) to upvote other posts, causing decentralization to become more of a  reality.there is a problem that i want to point out when it comes to raising the bar. by setting the threshold too high, less and less people will remain active as the posts become more and more intricate, although i don't think that is a major problem from here, but something to keep in mind for sure. i think until we hit that point, seeing higher quality post will challenge most people here, and increase engagement overall.

my answer is: it depends. if we buy a bitcoin now and it reaches its current all time high, we'd be talking about a return of less than double. that's very little considering that this is crypto and crypto means sick profits. if the good predictions came true and it reached $100,000, we would be talking about something less than x10 of profit. this is a lot. not bad at all. but being crypto and being bitcoin, i still find it a bit poor considering the tremendous effort that bitcoin would need to make. one thing is clear, if you want an insane profit, the moon, the lambo, you have to go for altcoins and use bitcoin as a volatility catalyst. that is, when bitcoin goes up and drags the whole market up. if you're looking for the dream of becoming a millionaire, you have to assume it's too late to buy bitcoin, unless you're willing to invest a lot of money or you're convinced it can reach 500k or even 1 million. which i personally see as unlikely, at least in the short term. bitcoin, however, can be used as a store of value. even if some people disagree with this, the truth is that bitcoin is nearly 12 years old and has only been more expensive than today during a few days in all this time. this is what a store of value is supposed to be. and it's not even mainstream yet.so what altcoins to buy? when i think of altcoins i am thinking of tokens with less than 1b market capitalization. tokens with a great growth potential. of course, the smaller their market capitalization the more price potential, but also the risk is higher. personally, i think the risk, during the bitcoin bull cycle, is a bit overestimated, since the whole market goes up. it's very difficult for the lowcap token you've bought not to appreciate by at least a x10. i speak from the experience of having lived the 2017 bull market. it is very important to choose tokens with the lowest possible supply. in a frantic market, where bitcoin is spreading collective hysteria throughout the market, the utility of the token takes a back seat. it's the scarcity of that token what will determine its price potential. and the exposure. and the exchanges the token is being traded on, or potential big exchanges that it will be added.lesson that i learned.i have explained this a few times already on reddit. i once had 18 bitcoin. today it would be $234,000. i didn't sell them to make a profit, i've always been convinced that bitcoin was going to reach 6 digits and i'm still convinced of that right now. i lost 18 bitcoin for trying to tame the market. it's impossible to tame the market. an idea as seemingly simple as buying cheap and selling expensive unwittingly changes into buying expensive and selling cheap. cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. there is no comparison to anything else. no one is mentally prepared to see bitcoin fall by 50% after buying, or to see bitcoin increase in value by 50% after selling. the stress that these situations put on our weak minds is what makes us fail. taming the market is exactly the same as gambling. you're betting that bitcoin will go down and therefore you're selling. or you bet that bitcoin will go up and therefore you buy. you can get it right once, but sooner or later you'll fail and ruin everything. it's a lottery. everybody in reddit likes to show off when they make a successful trade, but only a few post when they fuck it up.in 2017 i had around 2500 tokens of a shitcoin called xlm (solaris). a very scarce token i bought very cheap. if i recall correctly, i sold them all at 20something cents and placed a buy order at 15 cents. the shit went down to 16 or 17 cents then skyrocketed to $40 in december. my buy order was never executed.there's no way to predict the future, even with all those lines that people who want to be famous do at the expense of your naivety, the market analysts. just buy and hold. don't trade. don't risk losing. don't play like this is a casino, this is an investment and investments take time. i was one of the lucky ones who bought xrp for less than a penny. i find it very funny when people make jokes about the price of xrp. a lot of people are in the red with xrp and think that xrp is a shitty coin. however, there is something they don't understand. they are not objectively evaluating xrp because they bought it at a very specific time. i have never been in the red with xrp because i bought before the 2017 jump. they and i simply see reality from different perspectives. the token is the same for us, our point of view is not. they call a token that has yielded a fantastic x100 from my investment a shitcoin. it's a matter of perspective. i want to tell you that for years, people who bought bitcoin at $1000 were suffering tremendous losses, as bitcoin dropped to $200 after that. today everyone would kill to be able to buy a single bitcoin at $1000. perspective. the casino is a short term game. the investments are long-term projects.the 2017 bull run took the whole market to a new level and never went back. are we going to see a new level in 2021? [removed] sorry if i'm missing the point in any way.i'm looking to get back into altcoins, and i'd like to pick a crypto which has most of it's coins distributed across the network, or at the very least one which has a philosophy of not hoarding a huge amount in case it gets valuable.as an example, i like ripple, but a huge deterrent for me is the fact the owner has kept a third of all generated coins for himself.thanks! earn your moons with actual content that you wrote about whatever you want within the rules of the subreddit - even if it is memes, we need more fuel for the mooning here!i know we are all excited and greedy and whatever but please, just keep posting to get more moons.upvote or downvote this post, i don't care, i know it will be mooning into the stratosphere disappear in seconds...then plunge back down again.see you soon! [removed] [removed] [removed] earn your moons with actual valid content (if you dare), we don't need garbage here.i know we are all excited and greedy and whatever but please, just stop.upvote or downvote this post, i don't care, i know it will disappear into the bottomless pit of memes in seconds... i gather that coinbase wallet is an easy way for people to start transferring their coins from coinbase to a wallet that you actually own, but is there any other benefits? mainly i'm wondering if it cuts down on transfer fees in any way or if it's just integrated with coinbase so a bit simpler to do transfers from coinbase to your own wallet. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] a market cap of only $2.5 million for a token like moon is low. like, really really low.moon has more utility than the vast majority of tokens and i feel extremely fortunate to have accumulated a decent amount of moons.we are all very lucky to be early adopters of moon. i've tried telling friends about it who aren't redditors and they just shrug it off. oh well, it's their loss.thank you r/cryptocurrency for the opportunity! let's go! [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] coinbase, blockchain, crypto.com, cashapp, and kraken. all of these are not working for me, and i have sent multiple tickets to cashapp, counbase, kraken, and blockchain, but none have responded at all?!! i used coinbase for years, but all of a sudden i get an error when i try to purchase (i never had a problem and i have a high level fully verified account!). and all these apps are doing it?? i tried to get verified on cashapp, i sent in my identification weeks ago. the app still says: pending verification we will email you in 24 hours, but it has been weeks! does anybody know what is going on? [removed] there are 6 months to claim moons for old timers who were given moons in the initial distribution round. as of now, most of it lies unclaimed.unless someone claims it by the end of 6 months, it will go back to the main pool and they will lose it! imagine losing out on thousands of moons because you didnt claim them?so get claiming people! [removed] [removed] [removed] before 2017, most people hadn't heard of bitcoin and didn't know what a cryptocurrency was. personally, i'd heard bitcoin mentioned by a friend of mine in 2015 (just in passing, i didn't look into it any further) but i hadn't heard the term 'cryptocurency' until about mid-2017.during the 2017 bullrun, bitcoin became a name that pretty much everyone ( hairdressers etc.) knew. with that, a lot more people alao became aware of the term 'cryptocurency', even though it was seen by many as some kind of dodgy internet money fad.but even with all that 2017 hype, hardly anyone outside of the crypto circle seems to have heard of the likes of etherum. i've spoken to people who are invested in stocks who have asked me about bitcoin, and whenever i've mentioned eth they say they've never heard of it, which is understanable i guess.but now, paypal has included eth, ltc and (ahem) bch along with btc as cryptocurrencies that can be bought and sold on their platform. suddenly, millions of people are going to be hearing about these other cryptocurrencies (and hopefully more to come, moons would be nice, lol) for the first time and looking into what they offer.what do you think the implications of this could be? do you think we could see the likes of eth hitting front page headlines in mainstream media in 2021 much like bitcoin in 2017?obviously paypal doesn't change anything to the fundamentals of cryptocurrency (and many argue it goes against them), but i'm interested to hear the community's thoughts on how this could unfold. [removed] below are some of the strategies i use to generate passive crypto.1. moons obviously, but im not expecting to make much and its quite time consuming, so ill just hold on to them and hope the price moons.2. used to trust third parties like celsius, binance etc with my coins, but after i missed the uni airdrop, i discovered a way to own my keys as well as make a return on my crypto. so i started providing liquidity on 2 different protocols (16% and 60% apy). as we wait for scaling solutions, ethereum side chains such as xdai look promising.3. [crypto.com](https://crypto.com): dont like the company anymore for many reasons which i might expose in a post someday, but a few months ago i did stake to get the red card (2% cashback). definitely worth it: got the 50$ referral bonus + 2% deposit bonus + around 90$ in cashback so far, so the card essentially paid for itself within 2 months.4. coinbase earn: made around 90$ by answering easy quizzes5. hny faucet: 2$/48hrs but still worth it, who knows where hny price will go.6. binance liquid swap: 10% apy on small amounts of stablecoins that would not be profitable in yield farming because of high gas fees and that you plan to use to buy the next dip.7. brave rewards: 2-3$/month. check out the [other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/comments/jajzrw/small_tip_to_increase_your_bat_rewards_with_brave/) i made to increase earnings and to withdraw bat from uphold almost without fees.8. cmc earn: quite disappointing, 0,6$ of band, no kava and 1$ luna so far.be careful out there tho, lots of airdrops are just time consuming scams. feel free to ask questions or share other strategies! hope this helped someone :)keep stacking and buckle up because this is going to be an exciting ride ! the link is here: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moon currently it only has about 5 hours of data, but already ~50k in trading volume has taken place. it doesn't seem to know the circulating supply, so it can't calculate market cap yet. 1 year ago i weighed 120kg(264lbs) and i felt horrible. so i made it my mission to not only lose that weight but to put the money i saved into crypto!it was a very rough path to where i am now but i am proud to say that today i lost 25kg/55lbs and saved a very big amount on fast food and alcohol, which all went into crypto.thank you crypto and thank you crypto redditors, you are always a great distraction and super fun to share ideas with!

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] hi guys,before this post gets modded, please note that this *is not* meant to be a shill, but rather a discussion on eth scalability and if people see this as being workable project / idea with current blockchain tech.basically this project (arcade city, links below) have made a peer-to-peer rideshare app that os already operational and works in (what i gather) a single city (austin?) and are looking to scale globally and cut ubers grass by eliminating the middle man. it sounds like the arcd token is going to be used for governance/payments/incentives etc, which is on the eth blockchain. this sounds like an absolutely awesome idea to cut out the middle man and enable drivers freedom / more reward for their labour. the question though, which keen to be discussed here, is can the eth blockchain possibly handle an operation of that magnitude without getting clogged? is this possible to scale now, in eth2.0 etc, or is this a great idea that is doomed to fail on eth blockchain due to scalability issues?website: https://arcade.cityuniswap: https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xa2e10137dbe88a10dd197f24efa403f0036e4f70 [removed] hi, i have a coinbase account and watched the videos for the coinbase rewards.i have sent an invite to someone so i can claim some free crypto,if the person who receives the invite already has a coinbase account will i still receive the rewards, or is this only for new account created ? [removed] [removed] [removed] since like 5 days i have been receiving bitcoin related spam messages to my email address used only for the crc account. any other similar issues? this email address is used only for the crc and nothing else related with crypto. for other crypto services, exchanges etc. i have a separate email account.the same post was locked and removed from /r/crypto_com/ that is the reason why i am posting it here, thank you. [removed] [removed] i think that the next addition to the paypal crypto offerings would be xrp or stellar xlm.  i mean both of these cryptocurrencies (xrp &amp; xlm) are connected to banks and already being used heavily for transfers.   it would make sense that they would be the next crypto in line to be  added to paypals roster of offerings.in not xrp / xlm,  what do you think it will be outside of bch, ltc, eth and btc?

 number of transactions would go way up, and bitcoin would start being seen more as a currency than a store of value.wouldn't that improve the overall value of the coins, which is good for all of us? right now i am using binance because fees are lower and i can buy in wazirx ( indian exchange aquired by binance)i also bought using p2p exchanges, but i like the concept of dexs like bisq, but there are 0 offers in indian currency , are there any other alternatives for bisq with better volumes.... ? ever since i got into bitcoin i remember saying that the inflection point is going to be when mainstream online retailers start accepting bitcoin. the day amazon takes bitcoin payments or even better yet, paypal lets users spend bitcoin on day to day purchases will be the day bitcoin takes off as a real technology. and not just a speculative toy for us to play with the price.ideally, there won't need to be a paypal as the middleman in the future. but as andreas antonopoulos put it: "the internet had to be built on top of existing infrastructure (telephone lines) before it could be used to it's full potential. bitcoin will be the same" (paraphrased).if paypal decides to let users actually use bitcoin for it's purpose and not as some speculative gamble, we're going to see the beginning of the beginning. paypal could be the dial-up modem to our internet. let's just hope some developer in those paypal board meeting convinces the execs to let the currency do what it was actually designed to dotl;dr: thinking about mass adoption makes my horny hey guys, what's a good way to buy bitcoin in india? hey guys, pretty new to this. wanted to know how to buy bitcoins in india. i found a few exchanges but not sure if they're the right way. they will reject any wires from third party processors. i tried to wire funds from fidelity only to have kraken reject them because they did not come from a bank, even though i provided screen shots of account statements and the wire from my side. now i have a decent chunk of money sitting in limbo hoping it gets returned.kraken needs to get its shit together. i was hopeful it would be a good coinbase alternative but not yet. coinbase can at least accept wires from fidelity. i mean fidelity manages over $7 trillion for fucks sake and kraken cant accept funds from them. what a joke. take care everyone. not to be race insensitive but the guy looked very similar. this was before i knew too much about bitcoin. i could be wrong. the only reason i was invited to a high profile party in malibu is because i am the duff to a very hot polish model. i choose to believe this is true. also took some acid while there. hi i am using the website bit2me to buy, i tried to buy 1350 dop (dominican pesos) the site then tells me that since it is the first time using my card (it is) it must be verified. my corncern here is that the process of verification requires a frontal photo of my card.i have read even in places like reddit that bit2me is trustworthy, i have also read that i does not matter if it is only the the front of the card.should i do it ?  or is it too suspicious ?## im expecting a dump after the election. good evening blockchain community!!:))i'm working on a uni assignment currently which i need to adjust a centralized business model for. the idea is to turn it into a decentralized business model (including blockchain, social contract, distributed servers etc.) that the company, the creatives (dj), and preferably all the other stakeholders benefit from.i already set up a plan but according to our tutor, we need to add feedback from experts.hence, if there is an expert here in this group that is willing to have a glimpse at my business model i would be very grateful!!reach out to me and i'll send the pdf document to you!! :)) it seems that one can't attach files here...

[removed] [removed] seeing bitcoin price today makes me happy ; ) without going into a bunch of math this is the easy way to figure it out.let's say you bought $778.00 \[0.05972483\] of bitcoin today currently at $13,026.00 for 1.0 btc.you take the last 2 digits of your bitcoin balance and turn it into cents. vwala!for every $778 you chip in today gets you $59,724.83 \[from 0.05972483\] when btc hits 1 million.&amp;#x200b;before when bitcoin was 10 grand each, it was every dollar you put in you get 100 dollars back. do i need to make my own wallet or can i just leave it on websites like btcmarket or coinspot etc? are there cases of people losing their coins? hi guys,a lot has changed on coinbase by the looks of it since the days of using revolut to avoid fees when purchasing btc.how are you all purchasing btc now? what's the cheapest method / website to use?thanks in advance i have like 60usd(349.79hkd) in my steam wallet left, which i would like to change it into bitcoin, is there any ways that i could spend those credit for bitcoin? (for example, buying bitcoin by gifting others games) any help? thank you so much! hi guys, i'm new to crypto and i just bought my first little bit of bitcoin on coinbase pro. my question is, how can i transfer my bitcoin to my hardware wallet? whenever i try to transfer, i get a message saying that there are "no funds to withdraw."is this normal? i want to back my coin up so it's not stored on a server where it could get hacked or deleted.any advice? also, are there other things i should be taking into consideration? i don't really know what to do.

[removed] [removed] [removed] like wtf [removed] so i was researching non-kyc methods of purchasing btc for myself and came across the paxful p2p exchange which seems to even allow paypal as a payment method.there's a pretty high price spread for these listed paypalusd-btc transactions -- like 15 to 20% and higher.i'm a hodler myself, have no interest in selling my own personal stash, but receiving additional income as a bitcoin middleman is pretty attractive.does anyone have experience trading on this platform?if i were to spot purchase btc on-demand from coinbase or gemini, trade for usd via paxful/paypal at a premium, then as long as i used lifo tax ordering i don't see how tax impact would be much of an issue. with such quick turnaround the capital gains would be negligible (or they'd be losses) and wouldn't really eat much into my profits from selling at a premium.anyone have any success with being this type of middleman either on this platform or another? kinda like wsb but crypto please utilize this sticky thread for all general **bitcoin** discussions! if you see posts on the front page or /r/bitcoin/new which are better suited for this daily discussion thread, please help out by directing the op to this thread instead. thank you!if you don't get an answer to your question, you can try phrasing it differently or commenting again tomorrow.[join us in the r/bitcoin chatroom!](https://s.reddit.com/channel/872992_7f67f22e296c2f65bd39f5af98f30a96b5e3e21e)please check the [previous discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/jfutn2/daily_discussion_october_22_2020/) for unanswered questions.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [tl;dr dondi platform summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdvug9ff6ai&amp;feature=youtu.be)[dondi.io](https://dondi.io/i/c029d4/)referral link to sign up.be aware it cost .0.05 eth to register which makes your account and unlocks 2 slots. every slot you have farms one dondi per hour.if anyone is familiar with forsage, dondi has similar aspect but actually gives people a reason to unlock slots and use the platform by rewarding user with a token that can be sold or redeemed for rewards.you can use dondi to redeem for meta mask seeds all on the block chainwallets have anywhere from 10$-10k$ in themfor me i'm getting tired of pre-sales and vesting a lot of eth for big risk and dumps. this is a low risk play for potential high rewardsyield farming + referral system earnings + loot boxes pretty nice mix of the defi space china was just testing digital yuan and it wasnt a success but if it wants people to implement it wont it go after bitcoin and 700k per hour for 51% attack can be done by china so can someone put me to ease please [removed] [removed] [removed] first off: i think moons are very cool, and i think they make an interesting addition to reddit in general and r/cc specifically.that said, i am not following why they will ever rise in value monetarily speaking for the following reason: the people who would "spend" them on reddit features and therefore be incentivized to buy them are the same people earning them.if you are active enough to care about the features that you can buy with community points, you should also be active enough to earn your own. is there a large enough community of people who would want premium r/cc features but for some reason aren't earning their own to buy up the additional 215m tokens that are yet to be issued?once again, i think moons are neat, but i am interested to hear if someone has a solid bullish case for why they would ever dramatically increase in value. this article on vox written by bill harris claims "bitcoin is the greatest scam in history its a colossal pump-and-dump scheme, the likes of which the world has never seen."now 2 years on, the company he founded is now listing it as a supported currency.https://www.vox.com/2018/4/24/17275202/bitcoin-scam-cryptocurrency-mining-pump-dump-fraud-ico-valuei always find it amazing seeing these doubters get proven wrong time and time again. crypto is moving forward whether people like it or now, the fact is this is the future. i am worried if i've jumped on the bandwagon and brainwashed by all the convincing arguments for crypto. i bought a week before paypal made the announcement about cryptocurrency.  when all these companies started to buy btc, i had a feeling this could be big.i bought half a bitcoin and planing on buying the other half by dollar cost averaging. but in the back of my mind, what if this is an elaborate scam and i've been hoodwinked? [removed] hi everyone,i'm pretty new to crypto, and i did not find any new related posts about this.europe is starting to go back to quarantine for some countries (only two at the moment).  other countries are likely to follow. do you think the crypto is going to suffer another crash like in march ? [removed] expensify is an expense management software provider whose ceo just emailed 10 million clients a political message and opinion from their corporate account.irrespective of the views in the message, the fact that a company handling financial data of clients would send out unsolicited political opinion is not a good look whatsoever. imagine if you are using expensify and have political contributions to the opposite party, but suddenly you find your private data is in the hands of someone who can exploit it against your interests. this is nothing short of betrayal of trust placed by clients.cardano / iohk happened to be one of expensify's clients, and along with many other clients have already decided to discard expensify and find a new service provider. see the tweet of [charles hoskinson](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1319605368117465090.html) who was immediate to call out the nonsense:&gt; i just received an email from @expensify ceo david barrett telling me to vote for joe biden. iohk currently uses expensify services. we will immediately begin looking for a new vendor. i did not sign up to have a service provider ceo email my employees pushing a political agenda [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] excerpts from the report:&gt;this implies that bitcoin could compete more intensely with gold as an alternative currency over the coming years given that millennials will become over time a more important component of investors universe. and given how big the financial investment into gold is at the moment, a crowding out of gold as an alternative currency implies big upside for bitcoin over the long term. **even a modest crowding out of gold over the longer term would imply doubling or tripling of the bitcoin price from here. in other words, the potential long-term upside for bitcoin is considerable.**&gt;furthermore, we believe the market value of crypto currencies could eventually rise beyond what could be justified by only valuing them as a store of wealth.&gt;in all, this weeks endorsement by paypal is another big step towards corporate support for bitcoin, which in our opinion would facilitate and enhance over time millennials usage of bitcoin as an alternative currency. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [cashfusion](https://cashfusion.org/) makes bitcoin cash a privacy coin. it's already been used to fuse hundreds of thousands of bch!make sure to spin up electron cash 4.2.0 today and get that liquidity flowing! (the more people using cashfusion at once, the more fusions happen, and the larger your "anonymity set".)_______________new to cashfusion? no problem, getting set up is easy =)just [download the electron cash desktop wallet](https://electroncash.org/). it's got cashfusion built in!set up your wallet (and be sure to write down your recovery phrase on a physical piece of paper, especially if you are going to hold significant amounts of coin in the wallet), then activate cashfusion by clicking the icon in the lower right:https://i.imgur.com/dxepltf.pngonce it's activated, your wallet will start "fusing" the bitcoin cash it contains. fusions happen over time as their own, separate transactions, and only cost you the network transactions fees (less than a penny). each fusion transaction will include *some* of your coins\*, so it will take multiple fusion transactions before all the coins in your wallet will be fused. (in the view menu, toggle the coins tab to see all of the coins in your wallet. in the "label" field, fused coins will show cashfusion info.)currently, electron cash keeps fusing your coins indefinitely. while it is on the roadmap to give you the option to stop fusing after some number of fusions per coin, there's no downside to leaving it to fuse continuously besides paying the transaction fees. (and every fusion gives you that much more privacy, while you are helping to provide "liquidity" for other fusers.)also, ec does not yet prevent you from spending unfused coins, nor does it prefer fused coins when spending, so it's probably best to leave it fusing and keep your whole wallet fused, and/or pick your coins manually from the coins tab. if you want that coin-management taken care of for your (and/or you're not comfortable picking coins to spend from the coins tab), you can always switch back to cashshuffle for now in the optional features window, accessible from the tools menu.happy fusing!! &lt;3\*"coins" are kind of a confusing concept when it comes to bitcoin, but you can think of them just like discrete "bills" (or... "coins") in your wallet, but instead of coming in only certain sizes like $1, $5, $10, $20, etc, they can be any amount sent to you in a previous transaction, like 0.618 bch, 0.000001 bch, or 123.45679 bch. (they can also be combined and split up. that happens in most transactions!) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] okay so i am using wirex for over 4 years now and i did have some small issues before but they were resolved in max few days.3 months ago my gbp account mysteriously disappeared from my account which meant that i couldn't top up my gbp card anymore. i contacted their support over 5 times asking for updates but every time i got the same answer, "give us more time"then i tried to order a new euro card which would work as i did have a euro account but i couldn't order it since my gbp card was in negative and i couldn't fix that negative balance because i couldn't top up my card as my gbp account was gone.i contacted support and i finally managed to persuade them to send me a new euro card themselves and it did arrive yesterday but now i can't activate it for some reason.in the meantime, while i was waiting for the new card to arrive i had to re-verify myself out of the blue and i sent them my id and it worked but soon after that it asked me to verify my address by sending a utility bill. i sent them but it been over 48 hours and i still didn't get verified. support says that i need to wait just like every time.this is just unacceptable and it makes me so furious as i rely on wirex to pay for some important stuff in my life and i can't wait anymore.does anyone know any good service which i could use to replace wirex because fuck this. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i've been getting a 'server error' everyone i try to withdraw my assets. when i asked why i got this message:&gt;we have run drive your account on our database system, your account is currently facing a bot response delay due to some hashscript error and bug inflation detected on your account that is why the transaction appropriate percentage value couldnt be processed accordingly.would someone please explain what was just said to me because they never got back and the words are giving me a headache.many, many thanks! [removed] [removed] [removed] i know a lot of people here are, and with good reason, only into btc and eth, but when i got into crypto (during the covid crash lucky me) vechain stood out to me. the versatility it seems to offer from benefiting the health sector to helping battle the counterfeit market seems, to me, to be something that a lot of companies would benefit from. i know a lot of alt coins all seem to offer their own little quirks which often dont end up getting picked up on, but vets supply chain monitoring could be huge, especially for companies such as nike which faces massive battles with counterfeit shoes given the sneaker market.after dumping money into vet at 0.003, 0.007, 0.012 and, fatally, 0.016 (unlucky me), the price has dropped and is at around 0.0092. i sold about 250 worth at 0.012 and have a current value of 207 remaining. selling now would mean i have lost about 50 so obviously id rather hold it for now, but does anyone here who has an altcoin portfolio see a future for vechain? its the only alt i can see having something happen with but having said that i havent really looked into too many others. would i be better off selling into btc/eth or holding? all feedback appreciated :)tldr:does anyone (who has looked into vechain) see vechain having a good future? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] currently crypto is not all that accessible to people that are bankless, technologically illiterate, or without devices to access it. certainly, some people don't even use banks currently.how do we as a community make it more accessible and encourage adoption? do we think that banks will tie cryptocurrency into their services in the future, maybe tie it into an exchange? will a government try to utilize coins that exist or mint their own to combat the preexisting coins?all these things are floating around in my head. [removed] &amp;#x200b;[the logo of the magnificent, beautiful coin called coinye. ](https://preview.redd.it/ewk2yvydtuu51.png?width=221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec37f41eca1d7ae10904fdbebf1eb16a3f9dac1)it's the year 2014, the year another famous memecoin doge is released. my friend and i were in high school, browsing the latest coins and then this gem appeared, coinye west (later renamed coinye). it was marked as a simple and funny altcoin for the hip-hop community, but not everyone liked it. the coin was based on  [south park season 13 episode 5](http://www.southpark.nl/full-episodes/s13e05-fishsticks), where kanye west plays the leading role.kanye west filed a lawsuit against the developers, as the coin was mocking him and infringed his trademarks. the lawsuit eventually made coinye disappear from the crypto scene as it was removed from exchanges, you can read the full story about it [here](https://www.coindesk.com/kanye-west-sues-coinye-altcoin-oblivion). however, their [site](http://coinye.net/) is still online stating: 'we're not back, we haven't been away!'.*i hope you like to read about some memecoin history, as some of you may never heard of it!* [removed] **regarding the bitcoin vs ethereum narrative**allocating capital in bitcoin but not in ethereum is a bet that the planned roadmap for ethereum will not be successfully implemented and/or its economic properties will not function as designed once eth 2.0 is fully implemented. the combination of pos, sharding and eip-1559 will allow for a monetary policy that can sustain the system with zero, possibly negative, issuance. detailed explanations of how this is possible has been documented through numerous interviews and blogs with developers and pundits. we also must take into consideration that even if the issuance is above zero, the returns from staking ether must be accounted to compare the long-term holding value proposition against something like bitcoin. if the staking rewards provide \~3% annual returns and issuance is \~2% then the equivalent issuance for a pow protocol would be \~-1% (this will never happen in bitcoin).&amp;#x200b;**addressing the claim that ether is not money**the narrative that ether is not money because the ethereum protocol is not designed to exclusively function as money is akin to saying that the internet is not a good emailing system because it is not exclusively designed to transmit emails. this type of narrative is trying to restrict the definition of money by suggesting that its the underlying protocol should not have functionality that extends beyond the conventional way we think of it. the reality is that ethereum is much better suited for a digital economy - ether is its native monetary asset. the ability to issue other forms of digital assets and execute computer logic in a trustless unified system with a natively defined monetary asset encompasses all the fundamental building blocks of a future digital economy. this is a future where monetary, financial and information systems can take advantage of the inclusiveness, permissionless and trustless aspects that are central to the bitcoin value proposition.the etheruem protocol is designed to do a lot of wonderful things, but it costs money to operate the network and that cost must be covered by something of value that can be easily liquidated or exchanged into other things of value.... otherwise known as money. the idea that ether is more akin to oil than gold/money just because the price metric for computations is called "gas" falls apart udner scrutiny. ether is strictly used as a monetary incentive. it is not magically burned to propel a fictitious machine that runs the network... the computers that run the ethereum network run under the same physical principles from the ones of bitcoin - they consume energy and someone has to pay for it. it just so happens that the monetary rewards and cost of transactions operating the etheruem network are done exclusively in ether, and therefore it serves as a monetary base. in addition, ether has been used as the monetary base for the acquisition of other digital assets during their ico phase. lastly, paypal has revealed they will be including ether as a means of payment for online merchants. saying that ether is not money is like saying the sky isn't blue.&amp;#x200b;**additional thoughts**1. the combination of staking, eip-1559 and sharding will allow eth to reduce issuance ahead of bitcoin's schedule. it is very likely going to allow for sustainable zero issuance which is something that is still up in the air for bitcoin.2. the switch from pow to pos will dramatically reduce the operational cost of the network while incentivizing ownership of ether. the reduction in operational cost is a huge factor contributing to a sustainable monetary policy.3. the true soundness of ether as a store of wealth needs to account for the returns from staking. that means that even if the nominal issuance remained higher than bitcoin, it could still a better investment when you account for the staking returns.4. ethereum can operate as an entire financial system. it allows for issuance of new tokens and it can operate autonomously as a digital assets exchange... so that means that it can be an exchange for tokenized fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, tokenized securities and commodities. think of a global market for stocks, commodities, future contracts and derivatives.5. the integration with digital assets is done natively in one network. etheruem serves as a native monetary asset with sound properties. tokenized bitcoins would not only significantly reduce security (value would be lost if either network is compromised) it also makes little sense if ethereum's soundness (staking - issuance) is superior to bitcoin.6. there are a gazillion more use cases for ethereum that would benefit from having a natively defined monetary asset.7. ultimately bitcoin might serve as digital gold as a hedge against ethereum. so they can coexist, but they are still competing with each other in terms of building value. every investor who is getting into cryptocurrencies should be asking what assets to buy and why. money allocated to bitcoin cannot be allocated to ethereum and vice-versa. [removed] bitcoin has been a greatly profitable market this year.the graph below shows how much your investment would be worth if you had invested $1000 at the start of the year.bitcoins has outperformed all markets shown on the graphhttps://ibb.co/jcdttpc [removed] are there any legitimate bitcoin escrow services? i've been scammed and would like a service to provide a little security for me. i've seen ads, but don't know if they are trustworthy. google provides some results that look promising, but finding reviews is difficult. does anyone have any information that can help me out? i would really appreciate it. have you thought how tiny the mc of moons actually is. provided the price stays at 0.07 after the next distribution, the mc will only be around 2,8 m. even with the total supply of 250 m (only in 2035) and the price at 0.1 itd make only 25 m, 250 m - at one buck.another point to consider is that, just like bitcoin, itll never reach max supply in reality - afaik only half (35 m) moons have been already claimed from the total of around 70 m distributed. in less than one month, the 6 month period for claiming the first (and the largest) chunk of moons expires. it most likely means most of these 35 m moons will never be claimed. plus half of the moons spent every month are burnt.i know, i know being able to buy gifs doesnt actually make them global digital currency of choice. but even adding merchandise and some of the other popular crypto subreddits to the use cases, would already expand the scope substantial. and those are more than easy to implement, while the scope of more elaborate use cases for 1,1 m users is real wide.bottom line - its really not bad having kraken interested in potentially listing a 2,8 m mc coin :) [removed] [removed] [https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/hoskinson-accuses-wikipedia-of-censorship-following-refusal-to-list-cardano/](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/hoskinson-accuses-wikipedia-of-censorship-following-refusal-to-list-cardano/)''iohk ceo [charles hoskinson](https://www.newsbtc.com/?s=charles+hoskinson) vents his disappointment over wikipedias refusal to list a cardano page. in a periscope video, hoskinson hits out following his discovery that the online encyclopedia sees cardano as lacking credibility.whats more, considering cardanos scientific credentials, hoskinson believes there is more at play than merely inadequate source data on the project.''video of charles clapping back at wikipedia founder **jimmy wales** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9wc36xuiek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9wc36xuiek) [removed] last minute delays on the eth2.0 deposit contract have delayed the launch yet again.it was expected to be launched today, but has been pushed back by 2 weeks now. the primary reason being a newer less-tested cryptography library.it was announced in a meeting by danny ryan, the ethereum 2.0 coordinator: https://www.pscp.tv/w/cmbogzflvlfzyuxntnpvuux8mu1zr05wb0vnalphd3zx8qoozv5x61eyxmeefaidhkefe0k-3we--bay0fv2the primary reason is the bls cryptography library created by supranational, a new company that does not even have a team on their website. bonehlynnshacham (bls) signatures are critical to creating keys, signing messages and are critical in the early phases.however, the library is under audit. it is also undergoing formal verification, which has some initial results, but the audit is two weeks in, and there is another two weeks of this audit to go.given how critical this library is and if theres an error we could f things up, that is the blocker,' ryan said.initially vitalik buterin et al intended to go with a much more established cryptography library, but a new dev justin drake successfully managed to get them to change to bls even though this had not yet undergone standardization.

UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// i know nobody can predict the future so dont tell me idkgive me predictionshow do you think btc will do by the end of the year?what do you expect for next year? my father has a medium size house that is fully paid off in a nice area. so besides taxes and normal maintenance on the property its all profit to him. to my knowledge real estate is going to be a large part of his retirement. hes also a mortgage broker himself so he definitely understands the housing market. ive had multiple conversations about btc with him over the years including during the 20k bull run. i can justify the great inflation hedge that it is but personally i feel like over the next 15-20 years btc would blow the roi compared to a rental property out of the water. most of my favorite shops are already on squarecash, though a few of them take paypal.  i'm curious if the 2021 paypal launch might force jack to move his ln timetable forward... by a lot.  i know he dropped a good hunk of change into a ln development group which made sense.he couldn't deploy an onchain btc solution to his point of sale unit due to confirmation times, but he could deploy a ln solution.  perhaps he might take the pp approach and allow "pay with bitcoin (from cashapp)".  so merchants could accept btc, but only if that btc came from a cashapp wallet.  still like a ln solution better.

[removed] title. bitcoin is at the top, we all know it. bitcoin is also the most trustable cryptocurrency due to its huge market cap.but is it really the best? or is there any altcoin that is undoubtably better than bitcoin from an objective perspective? like, only taking in account the functionality itself.personally i think bitcoin is too slow and stagnant. transactions take long and it's not suprising to find them overpriced, completely defeating their original purpose of "a coin to send very small transactions with barely any fees".however, i lack both knowledge and experience to tell if, for example, ethereum is better.at first it does seem better. however it still seems to have the same issues: scalability. is it really prepared to hold millions of transactions daily? will updates to the code make it possible?are all these coins heading to an inevitable death in a distant future, where a new and better coin will reign? #disclaimer: i am not a financial advisor, please do your own research.graph 1: 2016 post-btc-halving price performance [graph](https://imgur.com/9atgqwr)graph 2*: 2020 post-btc-halving price performance [graph](https://imgur.com/xorxnvx)**disclaimer 2:** these are two imperfect data points, you could even argue and say "cherry picked" data (since we are not technically six months post-halving for bitcoin yet, that day comes on november 11th). i just thought it would be fun to discuss this as i took two random screenshots of bitcoin's price performance on coingecko.graph 1 highlights:day 1 price: $638.32 btc.lowest price on that graph: $517.13 btc.highest price on that graph: $1130.85.final price on the graph: $894.03.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [https://imgur.com/a/apffvsh](https://imgur.com/a/apffvsh)&amp;#x200b;everything is in the title. i think it can be pretty informative to share our biggest mistake(s) to help others (newbies?) to do not do the same.mine is a classic : fomo.back in december 2018, i heard about iota. price 3.5$. then, the partnership with microsoft came. price : 5+$. i wanted to buy. although, i was very careful i and knew that the price will go down : all of those news (including the project itself) were for me promising but still vaporware. i waited and waited and (wrongly) predicted the bottom of iota around 1$.then february-march 2018 came. everywhere it was mentioned that iota was a boiling pot : so many ideas, revolutionary projects on the way (q, ternary, volkswagen partnership etc.) and most of all, a brand new wallet about to be released. iota price : between 1.2 and 1.6$. a good opportunity considering that the price was 5+$ only few weeks ago (and that i predicted the bottom around 1$). so, i started to buy. and i kept buying.may 2018 was a pretty good month : the iota team released a countdown to unveil their mysterious project : q (end of the cd : 3rd of june 2018) and the price was going down. i had this fear of missing something big... very big. i wanted to load my bags, so i did (i can not find a better definition for fomo).3rd of june, few hours before the end of the countdown (supposed to reveal everything about the q project that will revolutionized the world), i heavily loaded my bags (buy the rumor sell the news as they say). and then, the drama happened.at the exact moment that the iota team released their stuff (which was only a simple website with few infos), the full crypto market collapsed. and it went down for months (years?) bringing iota to 0,21$. 0,21$... 5 times lower than the bottom that i predicted.i never wanted to sell. i should have followed crypto-veteran advice : sail the storm, don't fight it. so, at the end, i nicely transformed 4000$ into 468$.i strongly believed that some wales synchronized themselves to sell using the iota countdown website. it was really at exact second that the iota team released their website that the market started to crash.after that, i was patient and i had the good idea to buy btc at the bottom (3.8k). how did i predict the bottom? : lot of research and of course luck.in retrospect, i kept a bit of iota and tried to dca (i consider it as a lottery ticket, risky but if it works : jackpot!) but i mostly went back on sure things : btc, eth, ltc, ada. i do not have the pretension to tell you in what you should invest, but diversifying (and getting back to standards) after a fail is a decent option.tl;dr : patient, did my research but at the end, fomoed. bought to hight, hodled. if paypal will not actually be allowing anyone to transfer their crypto out of their paypal wallet into another wallet,  is it possible that they don't even need to have any bitcoin to sell it (ie its a derivative) and therefore it would just be adding in extra supply taking away demand from the real bitcoin with a hard limit of 21 million thus suppressing price? [removed] [removed] i tried to look for some information on this topic but wasn't able to find much information on this. i thought this could also help the other members here to understand how the distribution takes place.i think the very obvious thing on how moons are awarded are if someone upvotes your posts or your comments but are there are any other things which are taken into consideration for obtaining moons? do the number of posts or just the number of comments count? if someone downvotes you, does that affect your moon count as well? i'm surprised this blockchain and its website doesn't get more attention. let's look at some of the features:\-ability to deploy a token to the blockchain with a few clicks\-deployed tokens are listed on their personal exchange\-holders of tokens are able to see posts made by the token creator. currently allows images and texts but future versions will include videos\-token creators can easily do airdrops and receive donations via the platform. currently only allows donations in mintme but future versions will include bitcoin, eth and tether (and more if there is demand)\-next version is going to allow purchases with credit card on website (already completed and being tested)a list of all the features and upcoming improvements can be found on their website or discord. best part? no ico and &gt;1mil market cap. this is a fun project that allows you to be involved instead of just a holder. you guys should honestly check it out, **you don't even need to buy any to get started**. like... seriously. only downfall is that it's only listed on stex kanye west talking about how bitcoiners are true liberation of american.![video](7bdeyl93n3v51 "bitcoin magazine") [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] new here. i'm taking a step back to reconfigure my security and privacy to enter the crypto space.if i understand correctly, dumbphones can't be used to buy and sell crypto (can't read qr codes...). i'm thinking of getting a degoogled smartphone whose sole purpose would be crypto, with a new paid email address which wouldn't be used anywhere else. i'd rather use my pc for crypto, but i believe sites like bisq are mobile only.opinions on this approach appreciated. thanks. [removed] i hate how difficult it is to have any form of crypto conversation on reddit outside of dedicated communities. nothing about my comment was hostile, i don't have any relationship with nexo outside of being a customer, and i acknowledged there are always going to be risks involved.it just infuriates me because we have access to avenues to help mitigate the damage of the impending usd collapse and so many people just want to put their heads in the sand and ignore everything going on.https://imgur.com/2wjn9mx [removed] [removed] hello guys, i want to share my crypto journey today.i came into crypto in jan 2017, at that time i didn't know much about it and only get to know 4 coins bitcoin, eth,ripple and litecoin . then someone guided me on whatsapp that there are few telegram groups you have to join to learn more so i used telegram first time and made new friends there.i suddenly picked myself very fast and start learning all things from trading to technology. even started doing technical analysis as it was in the trend at that time. i made my own telegram channel to guide people about cryptocurrency and even discord group of 50 people and they were very happy with my service, but after 2018 i felt very low as it was a long bear run and i thought now its time to change field as i cannot survive here in long run as a full-time job. so i went to the vlsi training center and learned how to do codes there, i was doing good and hoping for the job there but then corona arrived in early 2020 and companies start rejecting new employees.finally, i again changed my mind and came to crypto, but this time i got some kinda marketing job in crypto space besides reddit moons will help me in the long run so i finally stick my mind here.do you guys also come back here after years? will love to hear from you :) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] hey all,i try to put $500 a month into investments and bitcoin is something i've started buying as i like to spread around my investments.my question is in crypto, am i best putting all my money into bitcoin, or are there any advantages for putting money into other coins (lite for exanple)cheers!

DOWN //POSTDATACOMPILED// so i finally got one. i just set it up. i download bit coin app. said scanning for accounts. popped up 2 accounts with a random name. i click those and says you can buy or recieve. are these now my wallets? yes, again if i derive 10 million public addresses from a single key and i send a transaction worth about $5k, how high would the fees be using this hd wallet system or is it negligible compared to sending 5k from a single address? btc prices ranged from $11,500 to $12,000 for several months.it rose to $13, 000 in three daysthe recent depreciation of the us dollar has caused the price of btc to rise. in the future, the use of btc payment is likely to replace the us dollar, and its price will be expanded indefinitely.i think now is the best time to invest in the btc market, see the chart belowhttps://preview.redd.it/34tpm4l4ucv51.png?width=2778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c816ef465eb7497d073e626f0c543d38bd9599d was curious if anyone has used larger lives new option to buy from coinify and have it directly sent into my hardware wallet. im tired of paying high network fees to transfer my bitcoin from either cash app or cbp. suppose address of person a has $500m in btc.suppose person b wants to buy $500m in btc.if person b tries to buy it on-chain using markets the price will probably increase as person b buys.however if person b tells person a "i will buy your address with $500m for $500m" then it has no effect on price on-chain.it seems to me that these transactions could be happening without affecting btc price.of course, i see that the same is in reverse and it makes it possible for person a to dispose of $500m btc, without affecting the price.is it a wash then?it seems to me that whales have two markets: other whales and the rest of us.can someone comment about this? am i missing something? is there a downside or upside? or am i missing the meaning of off-chain transactions? should we all just start putting bitcoin stickers up in public places?? what do you think? similar question to the 10 coins, would you hold cash? or hodl? i just kinda bought bitcoin. i have it now. what the flip do i do with it https://news.bitcoin.com/tim-drapers-venture-studio-triple-down-blockchain-25m-fund/ not sure when they added coles but first i noticed it today. this is so awesome. it actually means i can live off bitcoin now.thanks bitrefill! im using a laptop with a gtx 1050 and i just got into bitcoin mining but im just wondering if this could damage my laptop. folks, at the old age i am i feel like i have lost my grip with technology.in my teens and early twenties i knew all about gadgets the latest craze etc....every time i read about bitcoin even when it was being talked about on the good old bodybuilding.com forums i couldnt make heads or tails of it.as im getting older i have begun to think more about retirement, god willing i see that old age. in about 12 years if i leave early or 22 if my investments dont pay off.i pay into an ok private pension. i have paid into regular 10 year saving plans with  the first to mature in three years with about 3k every year thereafter.my question is this and please forgive for sounding outdated and left behind. i want to invest in bitcoin for the long term. i have no desire to make payments with it as i prefer the old way of cash. i believe that it will hold me in good stead in 12-22 years.i am not switched on enough with terminology and the like with bitcoin. i can do stocks and shares that is easy. i dont trade i invest. i put my money into solid companys and forget about it for a few years unless i hear something detrimental.i just want to invest in a single bitcoin and forget about it... whether it goes up or down today tomorrow next month or next year makes no difference to me really just that hopefully when i do need it itll have matured nicely.can i just leave it and forget it in say coinbase? someone in r/financialindependence made a post asking about bitcoin in their portfolio. the responses were mostly flooded with people saying bitcoin is a scam and will go away. here and there people saying they have a small % in btc. i got in a back and forth with one guy that clearly has never looked into bitcoin at all just spewing inaccurate lies.feast your eyes on the average person who claims to be financially literate (we are still early): https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jhxtsr/does_bitcoin_have_a_legit_place_in_ones_portfolio/ga2x3xg/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3 basically what the title says, what country is the best to be living in to save big on crypto day trading taxes and capital gains, while being able to enjoy the nice tropical weather all year round? i think giving a little more in taxes to live in a more developed country with more entertainments is a good trade off, however i think having to pay 50% of income on day trading profits is something i simply can't live with. i have been hearing a phrase about bitcoin and it is "not your keys, not your coins", my question is if you buy  bitcoin thru and third party to store them, how do you store them yourself and how do you keep your own keys, people seem to repeat that sentence quite often but they do not a lot of explanations. does any of you have any sources where i can find answers? im thinking in spending a couple of months in buenos aires once the pandemic calms down a little.i was reading a little bit about the usd situation in argentina. the usd blue is worth double of the conventional usd.i was wondering how does it work with btc. theres something like btc blue?

i am very curious what the 1099s will say next march or what reddit thinks they might say. is etoro worth buying bitcoin? i tried doing it but i dont even think it took my money and i couldn't figure out how to withdraw the bitcoin afterward anyway, any other tips for needing bitcoin without id? coinbase is fucking me if i owned a house, i would think it's mine not because i live in it, but because if somebody had a legal claim for it, i would presume that he couldn't take it from me.there would be some kind of record of the property connected with my identity (in a limited sense, more of my issued id and some other identificators, not my person) and some form of local municipality or other authority would easily resolve it to my benefit.if i owned a car, it would be pretty similar situation in practice. a car can be taken from me easier than a house, because a house is harder to move. but there are authorities to help me.if i owned a computer, i would assume it's mine because i paid for it. it is not connected to my identity, and my ownership in a dispute is provable by owning an invoice/receipt, in best case with matching serial number.this is not the same kind of ownership as my imaginary house or a car. let's call this ownership by proxy. proxy in this instance being an assumption, that it would be very unprobable for someone else than me to be even aware about my dispute, not even think about how weird it would be if multiple people presented a valid receipt/invoice. but we could think of a scenario that if they did, i could lose the dispute.***i do not own any bitcoin.****i may or may not know about some privkeys that may or may not control a couple of sats.*if i had a legal dispute over those few imaginary sats, i have nothing to present to make my case favorable to me. nobody will insure it for me, while my computer can be insured for physical damage. there is no authority to help me.*if i really controled those few sats, i would think of them as mine because i didn't steal them.****i wouldn't need any help.***but even in a dispute over my house or my car, my body and my thoughts likely won't be enough to fight for them. i'd still likely had to present some kind of plastic card, possibly also stacks of papers. perhaps even say words and go places.*if you store your bitcoin on an exchange, or with services such as robinhood, paypal soon enough, or countless of others custodians, let me congratulate you.****you own bitcoin.***you own it almost like you own your house, almost like you own your car, maybe somewhat like you own your computer. if it wasn't at your house.**you own bitcoin, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.**but it's not yours like your thoughts and your body is yours.i would gladly pay taxes for the house, car and a computer. my happiness with these taxes could likely be proportionate to my expectation of relevant authorities helping me in a dispute. there is no difference in which currency did i pay for these things.**i am not paying taxes for my thoughts, that would ruin me financially in a month.**but i think of the community i live in often.tl;dr not your keys, not your shit. your shit, your choice. my current portfolio has no crypto. im want to diversify into bitcoin but im skeptical.my current portfolio has a broad based index, mchi, sector based etfs, and a few reits.what future growth potential does bitcoin have for me?

[removed] i'm just wondering how you guys feel atm. how is the r/bitcoin communities these days compared to back then? how are the sentiments compared to back then? also, do you feel the bull coming? so i just got a ledger nano s and transferred my btc from a paper wallet to it. i have the coin stats app on my phone and i imported my ledger public key into it so i can watch the balance.i buy btc using cash app. can i just send btc from my cash app to the public address i imported into coin stats? would that transfer only be confirmed once i sync my ledger sometime in the future?normally i would plug the ledger into my computer and generate a new public address and confirm it on my ledger and have my cash app btc sent there. i sign the transaction during this but i do not know what this means.another question, if one pro of the hardware wallet is it generates a new public address for each transaction. but how was i able to import just one public address into coin stats and watch the whole balance of the wallet?thanks has any analysis been done on whether it is safer, for the average person, to hold crypto on an exchange or in a hardware wallet.while i understand the not your keys, not your crypto rallying cry, it seems like the threat models for exchange vs hardware wallet are different.at an exchange there is a team of security experts who are looking to safeguard your crypto. while you are exposed to risk of fraud, or bad actors at the exchange (mitigated by multi-person authorization), you also get the benefits of their security focus and insurance policies. the other risk to an exchange is that they are typically more attractive targets than an individual for hackers.storing in a hardware wallet means you need to trust the hardware manufacturer (and that it hasnt been tampered on the way to you), you computer (and that it hasnt been tampered), os and all applications, as well as your own security awareness and practices. not to mention the risk of losing the keys or getting wallet stolen. your own the keys, and youre less of an attractive target for hackers or nation states.love to hear your thoughts and any links to thoughtful security analysis. the situation in lebanon is dire since their currency has lost more than 50% of their value this year and the banks are not even allowing withdrawals anymore. my friends father has most of his lifes savings in the form of physical gold (6 figures worth in usd) in a safe and he needs to find a way to transfer this value out of the country. he cannot fly with all of it for obvious reasons and he cannot trust the shipping services there due to the corruption. so the best way is to own bitcoin for it to be able to transfer it to his son in the usa. the issue is, how do we find someone locally who would have bitcoin and want gold for it? i've checked localbitcoins and bisq and there are no local markets there. i'm open to all suggestions, thanks.

[removed] hi, i've been away from the btc space for some time, just checking in now and then to see what's going on. years ago i got it into my head that at some point in the future there would be opportunity to essentially become a payment processor by providing liquidity to the lightning routing network. for people who have been following things closely, 1) how feasible does this seem, 2) time-wise how far away are opportunities like this, 3) will it even be worth it seeing as transaction fees are predicted to be low, and 4) technically what would the liquidity provider need to set up or have in place to capitalize on this? thanks can we expect an altseason by new years? or will bitcoin continue to pump ahead for a while? hi guys. i'm having trouble to understand the new crypto feature on paypal. will paypal have a bitcoin wallet? or is just going to work buying and selling on crypto stock?

UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// [removed] harvest finance, a defi protocol, released an analysis report on hacking incidents. harvest said that the attack was mainly due to the attacker repeatedly using the arbitrage losses of usdc and usdt in y pool on [curve.fi](https://curve.fi) to manipulate cash. in the follow-up, harvest will take the following measures and compensation plans: 1. the funds returned by the attacker will be returned to the user in proportion to the snapshot. at present, the attacker has returned more than 2.47 million us dollars in the form of usdt and usdc; 2. after that, a commit-reveal mechanism may be adopted for deposits to eliminate the behavior of performing deposits and withdrawals in a single transaction, thereby reducing lightning loan attacks; 3. consider using a forecasting machine to determine asset priceshttps://preview.redd.it/sxhb2q264kv51.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=308e5f518dbc6f4825b8e48abde21d1f3c4c1d5b [removed] [removed] released from the start. limited supplies,  supplies that had ended up losing. over time more people had less and wanted it. price went way up. since bit coin is limited and barely the entire globe has it. when it finally goes mainstream do you think the price will go to psychotic levels ?

[removed] since hd wallets allow for diff receive address from the same seed, can one also move funds without showing the transaction on the blockchain.  for example, suppose btc is sent to an address, call it address a, in a hd wallet.  is it possible to move the funds from the wallet from another address, call it address b, such that if someone were to do a search on the blockchain explorer using address a, the sent transaction does not show up? so i've been using blockfi to earn interest on a very small portion of my bitcoin for some added compounding effects that it has (especially as bitcoin moons). i'm really wondering what this community thinks about the service, as i know "not your keys, not your bitcoin" is fundamentally correct, but the 6% yield they give seems to be very sustainable and it seems about as risky as holding on an exchange (and i'm aware of the risks). ive heard a lot of different opinions about bitcoin, my budget is around 30k and i am not that deep in the topic so far. so i thought you guys could give me advice or information i have a source. says things are looking up. says we might hit all time high before years end. says moon is shining bright. may moonlight guide us. i'm shooting my shot - i would love to get jack to hop into zoom for just a couple of minutes to tell my classmates and myself about his confidence in bitcoin.i am taking a cryptocurrency course in a well-known public college in new york that largely serves underprivileged new yorkers (like myself). i know jack really cares about progressive values so i thought if i could only reach him he would most likely agree to do it.we are a bullish, passionate college class and would love to have jack on for 5 minutes. if you could relay this to anyone that could reach him, i would appreciate it.\*and i've looked at the rules thoroughly, i don't believe this post violates any of the sidebar rules, but if it does please go ahead and take it down. my apologies. hi, i'm a newcomer. the other day, i followed some instructions and ran my first bitcoin full node on a server!i'm looking to to do the basic stuff like create hd wallets, fetch utxos from all the addresses, and send transactions. my programming language preference is python.can i get a link to the bitcoin apis/documentation that i can call to do such a thing?i tried bitcoinlib because it seems simple but it goes through third parties and querying them every time i send a transaction is too slow.anyways, looking for some help! i just whipped up a 2-of-3 using specter-desktop (excellent experience so far), and i'm having trouble validating the change address when signing my send transaction. i see a change address, but i don't know how to validate that it is mine. does anyone know a quick way to do that?

[removed] [removed] an unappreciated philosophical and economic impact of bitcoin from my perspective influenced by adam smith.at least for me. maybe you guys thought about this before, but this came as a light bulb eureka kind of moment for me the other day. sorry for eventual typos, not native english-speaker. also a warning for the wall of text :)bitcoin is not only the censorship resistant, immutable, transparently scarce, store of value, transactional vehicle to name a few of the unique characteristics. all these characteristics make bitcoin unique, not by themselves but the fact that it is bundled together in this perfectly balanced code. it is not only capital preservation, but actually **capital transactional reservation**. this type of characteristic is in my opinion revolutionary. why is it? let's have a quick overview of the current situation and division of labor, capital and ownership. in my interpretation of smiths an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations each member of society that is not dependent on the welfare and good will of others is part of the following three categories, often a little bit in each. namely;**the providers of time (labourer)**most people find themselves in this category most of their lifetime, and almost everybody does at some point in life. this category gives up their time in exchange for value (money) which in turn can be exchanged for whatever needs might arise. a few advantages of being in this category is;* it creates relatively predictable value flows. (x amount of time = x amount of current value)* it is in many cases low thresholds. (you can physically sell your time directly)* it can be fulfilling if you exercise a craft you are passionate about.* can accumulate knowledge and competence which allows to move in the economy and direct these skills in other areas as the economy evolves.a few disadvantages with this category is;* limited value exchanged (only so many hours, days and weeks in a year) the potential is limited both in time and in value (no infinite salary to date).* not creating recurring income, i.e. you have to sell your time over and over again in order to keep your buying power.* less freedom - your time and buying power is dictated by your employer.**the providers of capital (investors)**most people do also find themselves in this category to some extent through pension plans. however most people do also buy capital equipment in order to consume themselves. but a great portion of the economy is represented by this group. instead of being paid for their time, they are being paid for the risk of off-putting consumption of their capital goods (or sometimes represented by currency) to the future and letting someone else use this capital in order to create value in the present.advantages are;* recurring income - one time investment could create wealth over long periods of time.* no time-boundaries. the investor can direct attention in other places while his capital is working for him.* no limits. theoretically speaking the potential is unlimited.* predictable over long time-frames.disadvantages on the other hand;* risk - the risk of value being destroyed or lost is apparent and in some cases even likely.* unpredictable income in the short to medium term - unlike labour.* high threshold - it is capital-intensive to be a successful investor. a high amount of wealth must be accumulated before this can entirely replace labour for consumption to appease immediate needs..**real estate (landlord)**the final of the three parts of economy is the landlord. the landlord gets paid for letting his land be used for different purposes both for the investor and the labourer. for example, would an agricultural company sometimes rent the land of a great landowner to generate value for the general population and create labour-opportunities.advantages of being a landlord;* in many ways the same as for the investor.* it acts as a kind of hybrid between investor and labourer, because owning land sometimes requires your time and attention to make sure it meets the chosen purpose of value creation. this type of work can definitely vary in intensity and can also be let out to other labourers, but nevertheless it often requires actual labour.* predictable incomes of value in a recurring manner.* scalable - often there is not double the administration in letting one property over two.disadvantages* it is also capital-intensive and requires a bit of wealth to overcome the initial threshold.* i might as mentioned above require some labour from time to time.* it often comes with capital cost and maintenance of certain parts of the land and/or its functionality.these are the three principal value-categories which get a share of each transaction in an economy. often all three get paid, but at the very least one of these categories have a share in each transaction that is made. governments are to be considered a sort of landlord in this example. when you buy a burger from mcdonalds, the **labourer** is paid to tend your meal, the **landowner (**mcdonalds real estate) is paid a portion for rent and the franchise-owner (**investor**) is paid through profit. and of course the government shall have their share one way or the other.so, how does this wall of text apply to bitcoin? well, up until recently the three categories above was the only way to place the transactions occurring in an economy since just holding cash would erode your buying power over periods of time. the incentives of the economy is spurring the three categories above since that would uphold all three of them and keep everybody happy. but bitcoin introduced a fourth alternative: **capital reservation.**the further elaboration is made with the presumption that bitcoin is the main transactional peg/vehicle for the global economy.i, as either a labourer, investor or landowner because of bitcoin, have the opportunity to reserve my capital from the transactional economy for however long i wish. this has a few wonderful impacts.for one, when my capital is withheld the remaining bitcoins get more valuable since there are fewer of them to transact with, creating more incentives to invest and work to obtain more. but, what if the value keeps rising? would not that lower productivity and stop incentives for both investing, working or owning land? in the short term, perhaps. but this will also slow production making bitcoin, as representing the whole transactional economy less valuable. because there are fewer products to go around so each bitcoin gets you less food, drinks and other consumptions since people are raising the bar of what they are willing to pay and as soon as the wheels are slowing down in the economy the entrepreneurs, landowners and career-hungry labourers will see other peoples slacking and stacking as an competitive advantage. they will take advantage of the fact that companies, investors and workers are growing fat and happy with capital appreciation and start driving innovation, production and efficiency again to get their piece of the pie.in a sense this will keep the already coming and going of natural business cycles but will likely smoothen them out and keep the state of the economy transparent for each to take advantage of in which manner they see fit. so by withholding your consumption you are actually contributing to the economy and **reserving** your capital at the same time. and since most people fall in and out of each category in different stages in their lifetimes the volatility of these cycles is likely to be less than with current inflationary fiat-systems. it is sort of a democratic way to force everyone in each category to take part in the economy. even by opting out.it will make preserving and parking your capital reasonable, accessible and transparent for yourself and the rest of the economy which is freedom in a whole new sense.that's it, thanks for bearing with the wall of text. [removed] i sold all of my bitcoin a couple of months ago because i needed the money, just two weeks ago i was thinking about buying a little but i didn't and now i regret it.should i buy some now or wait off till it drops and then buy because i don't know the play here. there are some exchanges that give you interest in btc from lending them your btc.at current levels it is not much. but if btc moons, it would be like receiving hundreds of fiats per day (of course depending on how much btc you own).has somebody thought about this?would be nice to live off passive income from btc. but also means not storing your own coins. that's my dilemma.

(that's this part i can't figure out). in the past two weeks, bitcoin has experienced an extreme rebound.at the time of this writing, the token had soared from $11,200 to $13,000, rising as much as $13,350 on saturday night.while btc is close to its weekly close of around $13,000, a key win for the bulls, the downside from here is cautious.there are signs that the cryptocurrency may be overbought in the short term, rising more than $1,500 in a week or so.so there is a good chance of an extreme rebound from the fall.it is recommended to hold the position and wait [removed] im 29 years old. i was around in the silk road days, but the only way to buy bitcoin back then was by going into the bank and doing a direct deposit into an exchanges account, so i never bothered. it was hovering around $63 aud back then.fast forward to this year and i finally got involved in crypto. bought about $200 worth at $11,000 aud roughly, and was stacking it every pay day.had about 0.25 bitcoin stacked and had to liquidate it all for a loss because of a financial emergency involving my two young kids. now im not sure ill ever have enough money to get back in.just was crazy pondering that if i had of gotten in at $63 when i was younger, that today i would be literally debt free and not contemplating suicide on a daily basis.buy in when you can lads. dont have second thoughts just do it. people tell about their impressions about the company and share your observations. everyone will be interested to know your opinion. #kittiefight #kty #defi i've noticed when i try to sell crypto the price of the crypto im selling is low but when i try to buy one second later the price of the same crypto is up a couple hundred. i've tried doing it a couple times just make sure the price didn't change and i found that wasn't the case. i hear a lot of negative things about coinbase, can you guys  please recommend something more dependable? -today's crypto of the day is xensor (xsr), and it's current price is $0.00413.-since 2/18/20, every day i have featured a new crypto of the day for us to discuss. i try to make follow up posts within a week, but i am behind at the moment. i try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. sometimes i even feature projects i personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. i feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. at this point, i plan to try to continue making these posts until i have completed a full year.-if you decide to reply, please add something more than, "scam" or "this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020". please say why. if it is a scam, link or show evidence. if you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? it seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags.-i strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. there is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. you may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. i know i certainly did!https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/search?q=author%3ajoenorwood77&amp;restrict_sr=on-these posts are not meant to be financial advice, but instead to be an educational discussion. everyone is responsible for doing their own research. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] im new to crypto, like today new, and i was looking up what exchanges are the safest. i keep seeing coinbase being considered for beginners but then i found out that it has higher fees than kraken. why would a beginner want to use an exchange like coinbase that has higher fees than an exchange like kraken which has lower fees? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] this glorious alpha numeric is the **genesis address** for bitcoin.it was here that the first 50 **bitcoins** ever issued were sent on 3rd january 2009 by the savior, creator, lord and master **satoshi nakamoto**. if you're reading this sn, bang up job mate, top notch.these 50 bitcoins can never be spent. or any btc sent to this address can never be spent.so you get to thinking, wtf are people doing sending to this address? 2616 transactions to date.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] of course it wouldn't be crypto is every single crypto somehow became stable, so for the sake of the argument, let's say only the top 10 projects right now (excluding stablecoins of course) are now half as volatile as before. would that be better for the market as a whole? would it become the mainstream way of life? what do you think the impact would be, if the switch was flipped tomorrow? [removed] all the markets was red and i feared bitcoin was going to drop 50% like last time. i sold at 12850 and lost some money since i bought at 13200. should i wait to buy bitcoin cause i feel the market is going to tank and bring bitcoin down with it. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] and which banks are positioning themselves to "cant beat em join em" first?ally seems to be the main crypto friendly online bank i can find but there seems to be an explosion in online banks with a growing list of attractive features.can anyone weigh in? i used [blacklight](https://themarkup.org/blacklight) on several of the coin ranking sites (cmc, coingecko, coinpaprika, etc) and i'm pretty surprised at what's being tracked. coinpaprika was the only site that "may be **capturing** keystrokes", while the others "could be **monitoring** keystrokes". messari was the only coin ranking site that showed up nearly spotless.give it a shot with whatever sites you frequent the most, and stay safe! [removed] i've recently gotten into the crypto scene on twitter. not sure if i've followed the wrong accounts, but 50% of my feed is just circle jerking about prices of coins...anyone got any suggestions for quality pages, sharing news/memes etc? im new to trading crypto and just wanted to get some outside opinions on the best method for trading. what are some pros/cons with buying direct through a crypto specific platform (coinbase, kraken etc.) vs buying through a trust corp (grayscale, etc)? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] it would be interesting to know how many people on this sub actually own a full bitcoin.https://strawpoll.com/2ke8xgdqethis is inspired by the post on the front page about bitcoin hitting 1 million and wondering how many of us would become millionaires of that happened. [removed] [removed] [removed] hello fellow cryptonians,this post is my prophecy on why nano will fail. it offers a detailed perspective on nano (formerly raiblocks) from a nano holder that has been holding and following everything nano-related since september 2017. i hope the mods will let this post stay and give a chance for nano holders to try and defend a sinking position and ultimately convince the readers that nano will sink and maybe save some money for a few.we've all heard of nano, you know the one. the best of all, "feeless", ultra-fast, decentralized... every crypto-idealists wet dream. but as most of you will learn after the next bull-peak, excluding few exceptions, cryptocurrencies are here to take money from people looking to make a quick buck and transfer it to the pockets of few patient and everpresent crypto-gurus. the newest trend is defi but that's a story for another post. can't wait to see how this part of crypto-history will unfold.this post is about how the nano developers have accidentaly fell into a pile of cash and then got lost in the cryptosphere. first of all, everyone needs to understand that colin lemahieu, the father of nano, is an amazing computer scientist and i'm guessing he's also a great person. although i've never met him personally, he seems like a decent, positive and honest person. the failure of nano was not due to the technology or having a scumbag founder, it was due to ignoring the existence of the cryptomarket.nano is going nowhere in terms of price because it doesn't have a market presence. nano won't have a market presence because the nf (nano foundation - the organization made to help direct the nano community and manage the dev fund which was less than 5% of supply at start and has fallen to a much lower percentage recently) doesn't invest time, work or money in having a market presence. the nf detests every mention of price and takes a morally superior stance, technology is more important than the market. while i agree that technology should come first, nano has solved all major issues and should have started focusing on the market ages ago. but they didn't, because they think they're too good for the market. it has become a sour-grapes kind of story. the market ignores nano because the market doesn't care for technology, only profit, and nano ignores the market because it's a special technologicaly superior snowflake.the community is abandoning nano. brainblocks and nanowallet have left the community. it was the most used payment processor and most used web-wallet, they said goodbye. do you think they would say goodbye if nano was playing the market?kappture and appia have been wet dreams of the nanites, wen kappture? wen appia? well we haven't heard any new from those camps in 2020. as far as the community is concerned those projects are abandoned. real world adoption ain't around the corner, it was a carrot-on-a-stick.the nano/btc chart is at an atl, where will it head from here? my prediction? first stop is 2k, after that - obilivion. this will affect usd price because the drop will be bigger than the btc % price increase.there was an incentive from the community to support the wrapping of nano, it failed. why? because risks. after bitgrail no one in the nf will risk of being associated with anything related to exchanges or any kind of custodialism so they ignored the interest from the community. they are scared! they never got over bitgrail psychologicaly. i haven't even come to the financial part.in adition to everything i've said above, nano is in for two major dumpenings in the near future. i'm talking about nf dev funds (\~540k usd) and the bitgrail funds (13,6m usd, 13% of all nano). nano has low volume for a long time and no one know when the bitgrail funds are gonna get dumped. in adition, since volume is low the dev funds are continuosly suppressing the price even with their small dev fund.since nano isn't even playing the market it is a miracle that nano is even still alive. my estimation, deducted from numerous talks with people active in the market, is that major holders are still profiting on this nano price and are artificially keeping it at this level and still making money on new idealist holders. the question is, why would they pump a currency that has 13% of it's supply dumped on them? rather wait for the dumpening and slowly dump your stash on unsuspecting idealists. binance is also among those major holders, you think they care more about nano's technology or making money? and binance is only one of those, most of the major holders are still in the shadows since they got their nano in the captcha distribution or bought for sub-cent prices.conclusion:nano has superior performances to every other cryptocurrency but it will fail hard and every idealist nano holder will lose everything they hold. why? because nf ignored the market.change my mind! [removed] [removed] as many of you know the rules around posting media (including memes) were recently changed.the old rule allowed for two comedy flaired posts during the week and five comedy flaired posts on the weekends. the issue with this is that people started realizing that if they just flaired their post anything except comedy they could bypass the bot, and it started to create a lot of work for mods to go reflair many posts per day. not only did it create extra work, it started to introduce a lot of judgment calls the mods had to make in determining exactly what was comedy for image macro posts.the current rule allows only four media posts (imgur, [redd.it](https://redd.it), gyfcat, etc.) to be in the top 25 posts at all times. this eliminates the issue of people misflairing their posts and also eliminates mod judgment calls, however, it has resulted in people trying to game this new system by just spamming images until they get one to stick.this proposal would eliminate the current rule and just allow for free for all meme/image/gif posting on the weekends, and zero media posts during the week.if this proposal fails, we will likely start to enforce the one post per domain per 24 hour rule on [redd.it](https://redd.it) and other media outlets, which is currently really only enforced on news domains. this would mean that even if the cryptomods bot removes your image post, you can't post from same domain for 24 h or you will get at least a 7 day ban.[view poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/jig33s) hi guys, ive bought a ledger nano s in 2017 and never really used it.ive bought it from the salt team, they had an event where they were selling them. the ledger itself has the salt logo on it, so im afraid it has been tampered. i want to know if its safe to use, is there any way i can check it? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] seriously, the cryptospace should get more adoption. but with tech like bitcoin the fees would rise to an non-economical level. the same counts for ethereum and all the other blockchains. please accept that iota outperforms all the other scams. we work without fees [removed] i bought the trezor one a few months ago at $38. i just checked the price of it and now its almost $60. i'm assuming it's because of the high demand of bitcoin right now. are you seeing your hardware wallets increasing in value as well?also, is the trezor one a good hardware wallet? [removed] [removed] im just wondering what could happen if theres a massive crash in crypto and many of the defi and collateral based loans out there have margin calls.  im thinking that would cause a lot of people to get hit harder than any crash prior.  before it was always doesnt matter until you sell mantra but if youve now got your assets being liquidated on top of a huge drop in price, it would hit double.i suppose it could have the opposite effect and people will be buying more crypto to cover the margin calls softening the downward price action.maybe im too uneducated in defi but it feels dangerous to me.  i think it could cause a ton of problems in the next crash.  what do you guys think? i have read two books about cryptocurrencies (or more specifically, bitcoin):**bitcoin billionaires: a true story of genius, betrayal and redemption (ben mezrich, 2019)**a story about how tyler and cameron winklevoss's first heard about bitcoin following their facebook ordeal and then which then lead to them creating their gemini exchange.**bitcoin: the future of money (dominic frisby, 2015)**an introduction to what bitcoin is, how it came to be and where it is going (5 years old but still a great read and relevant in my opinion).i really enjoyed both books and was wondering if anyone has any other books related to cryptocurrency they would like to recommend? for anyone else wondering why nft's (non-fungible-tokens - what a shit name) are such a big deal. it's basically a way to have your own digital banksy, which can't be photoed and can't be faked. not only that, because the new wave of coins like chonk are producing nft's only from relatively big-name artists, you can buy blind by farming without having to research for quality art. and there's also a space for "shitty" art, because it will be cheaper, easier to farm and there's always the chance you'll strike gold.i don't see how it can't be big. now give me my fucking moons. [removed] [removed] so, i just reviewed koinly reports, and i came to an interesting realization in terms of tax law.so, when you deposit to a liquidity pool, you are given a token. now, that token is redeemable for the underlying assets. however, that token has no market value. the redeemed underlying assets do have market value, but the token itself is not traded anywhere. for all purposes, its worthless.now, why is this important? well, the irs likes to use legal fictions like "if you trade btc to wbtc, you are incurring a taxable transaction because its from one token to another" this is their rules.so, it can also be argued that if you deposit tokens to a uniswap smart contract, you are changing your risk profile. for example, what if uniswap had a smart contract bug discovered? the actual risk profile here is changed entirely.if the irs wants to classify our tokens as property, and force us to play a shell game where if we swap one asset like eth for another asset like maker we are "incurring a taxable event" while we never actually cashed out, then their game rules can be used against them, and people might be able to win in court against the irs. swap to liquidity pools, and rack those losses to mars.relevant us code: [https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title26/subtitlea/chapter1/subchaptero&amp;edition=prelim](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title26/subtitlea/chapter1/subchaptero&amp;edition=prelim)also, if this idea just saved you $10,000+ in taxes, this needs to be bumped to the top of /r/cryptocurrency.and we need the finest legal minds to discus and debate this. [removed] [removed] moons made this sub more informative and people are engaging more here and try to interact and share their valuable opinions and thought with everyone.in hot threads i can see so many informative and scam detector post nowadays, everyone tries to keep us up to date regarding their past experience/regulations and scams and phishing attempts (like a ledger phishing attack) and in return, we upvote them for their contribution.**that's a win-win situation for everyone here**but still, i have seen some people try hard to promote their upcoming or ongoing scam projects like hex, for this, i was thinking that what if we should start creating one daily thread on* scam* hack* phishingand everyone will share their opinions regarding it. will love to hear your responses regarding this.

[removed] [removed] i have few bucks in bitcoin earned from a promo campain, but they don't let me withdraw it. i think i can only spend it there. is there a way i could sell this to to another user or if i would spend it there do you have any idea what could i do? any advice? [removed] [removed] the travel rule is fundamentally changing the way we use cryptocurrency today. in basic terms, the travel rule requires financial entities to share information about their clients and customers to authorities and report suspicious activities that they suspect their clients are upto. this rule is promulgated by fatf -financial action task force as a way to combat money laundering and terror financing and they require all banks, card companies etc to follow this rule. but as usual, using the umbrella of money laundering, they want to spy on and monitor every users transaction much like an orwellian big brother.in june 2019, fatf extended the travel rule to crypto exchanges as well. in fatf terminology, crypto exchanges are known as virtual asset service providers (vasf) - this includes all exchanges, custodians, ico/ieo issuers, payment providers and any regulated entity in the crypto domain. in the fatf guidance for vasfs, they extended travel rule to cover crypto assets and transactions above $1000.under these guidelines, not only do the exchanges have to share data with authorities, but also with other exchanges. for example, coinbase can easily pull up your entire information from binance, if they just notice a transaction between your address and binance! (this is easily possible by blockchain analytics)they are also required to build a profile of every customer to track patters. for example, if you are trading size is around $1000 and have a monthly average balance of $5000, but suddenly deposit $100k worth cryptocurrencies, this will internally raise alarms at the exchange and alert authorities, lock your account asking for further information. this is already enforced by most exchanges.but the main privacy concerns arise with the requirement to track your withdrawals. some countries like switzerland have already enforced a rule asking their crypto exchanges to link and verify each blockchain address to a person before allowing on-chain withdrawals. imagine a world where the regulators directly link your blockchain address to your identity like ssn! the swiss model is a pilot and in next year fatf may mandate such a model for every country!now the federal reserve has put up a proposal that threatens to **lower the threshold of reporting from $3000 to $250 for all transactions outside usa**! this means that details of every transaction between exchanges outside of the usa exceeding $250 would have to be collected, retained and reported to us authorities. so if you send $500 worth eth from say kucoin to anywhere (a dex or an ico or your own wallet address), kucoin would have to preserve information about this transaction, map it to your personal identity like ssn and report this to the us authorities!you can view the draft proposal here: https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-23756.pdfthe fed is also inviting comments on this, you can also submit your comments here: https://www.federalreserve.gov/secure/forms/electroniccommentform.aspx?doc_id=r%2d1726&amp;doc_ver=1 i have some remaining affilate funds on digitalocean which must be used before january, otherwise they will be removed. what should i build? not necessary something profitable. i was thinking about a bitcoin node, but there are plenty of them. some simple staking node? any other ideas?

[removed] i was a dumb and implulsive idiot who found out about crypto last year and started trading it like a maniac with no research, ended up using margin, and losing half my money. now i have to get ready for taxes and i cannot find a cheap service that supports margin trades. the one i used before doesnt know how to compute losses or gains when you have margin trades. please help [removed] [removed] [removed] on track for an insanely good 2021.as can be seen on the chart there is a big similarity on each cycle. the phase from the bottom to the halving is 51% of the whole bull cycle,  while the rest (halving to top) consists the 49%. practically we can see the halving at the middle of each bull cycle, so we have a sustained rise to at least october 2021.this  is a pattern for long term bitcoin holders to follow but it certainly answers the question 'is it too late to buy?'

UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// haven't posted for a long time. been tumultuous since i joined the community in 2017. i had weak hands and cashed out my .25 at the atl for 2019 in march of last year after a rough time in atlantic city. i know i know, but i needed something to get bills done after  the buffoonery. hard knowing that that paltry 1k would be closer to 3.5 right now. anyway. kept my greyscale shares and have been adding to that steadily and am happy to say that after being in the red for the better part of three years i'm only at a $90 loss where at certain times it was nearly 1k or more. i know not your keys not your coins, but it is real skin in the game. concordantly, i did return to the market this spring with some of that govt handout and all i can say is i wish i had had more solvency at the time as it's all ready at a 50% return. pretty incredible to witness. 2020, what a year. ok, sorry for the diary entry, but no one in my real life would understand half the shit i just said, that's why i love you guys. let's get more pump and less dump!happy moon ride! [removed] get btc for pp. pm i need help with knowing when my btc will show up in my wallet. its been over 12 hours since i withdrew from cex.io. heres the hash.b7d3e09c99f88b060db7036788d873d7f72990a7f684d0612b64d7bd8cf76edfany help will be appreciated i know im probably gonna get a big fat no but i wanted to get a game from a trusted site called [g2a.com](https://g2a.com) and they accept bitcoin now i don't have a account for any bitcoin sites ( age of 16) but i know a site that can give you rewards for doing offers the game is 0.94 i can send you 2 dollars in bit coin then you buy the game for me and you keep the other one for your troubles this might sound shady but please? if anyone is asking the games name is gun of icarus alliance you can check on [g2a.com](https://g2a.com)thank you and have a good day since february 2018, the last ath was 13,793 on june 27, 2019. incredibly bullish! burn motherfuckers burnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn me first, i've scammed by an exchange named usdex in 2018.i am a hongkonger, and they told me that it was an exchange that is renowned in the u.s. then i deposited and lost about 0.8 bitcoin. i have a desktop wallet installed on my linux laptop, the thing is, besides a keylogger, how can malware steal my privates keys? aren't they encrypted by my desktop wallet? kinda new to this whole thing, drove hours to get it all excited and while i was driving i realized most of my research was from 2018 youtube clips. came home after a 4 hour drive , paid 75 bucks, plugged it in, tripped the circuit, and realized the fu, to run this its gonna take about 4 dollars a day in electricity while only mining a few sats at 1.25 a day. why does bitcoin have way less transactions compared to ripple or ethereum will it help?  will it hurt?  and why? sorry for the shitpost title but i need your help, yes, you. i need 3-5 reasons why my small business should accept bitcoin as a form of payment. you do not need to convince me but rather my three other business parters that have zero exposure to the concept of sound money. can you help me?  the best reason i have come up with is the fact that it exposes our company to a global payment system that we wouldnt otherwise have access to?if i am able to convince them, i will probably just use coinbase commerce. i know they are the worst but it will make it easy to start and then transition out to something closer to freedom. this is genuinely confusing to me. i am someone who holds and uses many different cryptos. i happen to use bitcoin cash a tiny bit more frequently, but also really enjoy using bitcoin. over on the btc subreddit i always see negativity towards bitcoin as if they have something to gain from it. what gives? some lady messaged me telling me that i can make passive income with mining. it seems too good to be true for me. www.zenithminers.com 16 m or so coins left. once its more adopted and goes to the next levels. people will want to own. not enough to go around. people ive told say thats not going to happen because x y and z. im convinced it is. thoughts? if i want to take a mortgage with bitcoin to buy a house, how would the interest rates be decided if cryptocurrency is decentralized? [removed] hi all,usually i use cashapp to buy my bitcoin (weekly, i dca) and then i store in in trustwallet, which is a mobile wallet owned by binance.i noticed they added a "buy btc" option directly in the trustwallet app, so i gave it a shot.unfortunately, they outsource the actual crypto buying process to a sketchy company, which uses misleading tactics.as you can see from this screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/eknji0z.pngus$5000 was to purchase 0.41635 btc, an amount that i'm happy with.however, at checkout, they change the deal to this: https://i.imgur.com/osqonpd.pngin simple terms, they wanted to sell me 0.43092 btc for $5000, and then added a $175 "processing" fee. that's more bitcoin than i wanted to buy, more fiat than i wanted to spend, and it brings the base price of the bitcoin from $11,603, to $12,009, a far larger number.i would have no problem with this if they were upfront about the fees and what they are doing, but now i have sour taste in my mouth. i've been into crypto for a little while. can you imagine how predatory this would seem to a new user who's going through their first buy? my name is tim morgan. my love for interior designer has been my source of joy for a long time. i first began my career at a very young age, following my fathers steps. i specialize in construction, doing many repairs, and making things like stairways, frameworks, partitions, and rafters.i love my job, but financial stability can be a struggle sometimes. i decided to look for a good investment that i could get into to have at least another stable income coming in. after much research and numerous unhelpful youtube videos, i discovered[ crypto trading](http://cryptotribesmen.net/) and found out about [crypto tribesmen](http://cryptotribesmen.net/).a firm belief in providing the users with the best crypto trading experience and successful strategies will increase your returns. i tried this out, and i must say its not disappointing. i set my daily goal to 0.364 btc initially, but i later worked it up to 0.758 btc daily. [crypto tribesmen](http://cryptotribesmen.net/) trading signals is always reliable. dedicated to providing the best quality trading experience. [removed] obviously theyll likely send me an sms verification code, but other than that, do they require any identification? what's your bitcoin for?i've always wanted to live near the mountains but not super far from a city with some stuff to do. of course that's a pretty popular combination so i've gotta stack a bit before being able to afford something like that.but that's just a goal, as i get older i'll adjust according to where i've ended up financially. spending bitcoin on emergencies obviously would be disappointing but better to be disappointed than hungry and cold :)and if nothing else i'm pretty happy with the life i have and where i live now. if i can drop to working part time or to something less stressful that's great too.that's my moon. i bought .27 bitcoin in 2017 when it was 900. sent it to a paper wallet. had paper wallet in my closet. one rainy day my closet leaked so i hid my paper wallet somewhere else. now i either hid it so fucking good or hid it inside something that i threw out. anyway i cant find it. will there be any trace of it on my pc in my files when i created it? im curious on how selling bitcoin would work when i had to claim it on my taxes. would i have to show proof from when i bought it? hello, i bought something from internet and payed with btc but that guy blocked me. i used really small fee and its not confirmed yet, i heared there is way to cancel/redirect it. please could someone explain me how ? not complaining lol i have sent two transactions now with relatively high fees with my wallet saying at the time it would be delivered in 10 - 30 minutes however its been over 24 hours now and neither have confirmed one of them i also upped the fee to make to hopefully make it go faster but it didn't[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/dfcf39c188ec28a7f78aca93bcac0abb64a4935e17a1f945755540a163f44b82](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/dfcf39c188ec28a7f78aca93bcac0abb64a4935e17a1f945755540a163f44b82)[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/4999212f1aca01f01226acf9fc78c05cbf6f4dc29b1696c7178d6651dae6da48](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/4999212f1aca01f01226acf9fc78c05cbf6f4dc29b1696c7178d6651dae6da48)does anyone have any idea on what to do? [removed] btc is heading to new ath. many new people are stepping up the train, and many of them are posting questions such as "how to acquire most bitcoin ?", or "is it still possible to have 1 btc", or "what should i do to secure my btc ?", and the worst: "should i put all my savings in btc" ? ...those are some legit questions, but if you are asking yourself those questions, you are probably about to burn yourself and becoming a future millionaire has maybe struck your head. let's just do some quick math to show you that you will not become a millionaire.following the btc pattern, i saw many youtubers predicting that btc price is heading toward 200k usd in one or two years. this is a very optimistic prediction. but let's take it to have the most favorable scenario.so if you are a broke ass newcomer like most of the people here, you can barely afford 1btc right now. if you can, your net profit in 1-2 years will be roughly 180k usd. this is a very good income in only two years. but still, you are not a millionaire.if you want to be a millionaire, you would need to buy at least 5-6 btc right now, which you cannot afford (even with all your savings) if you are part of the people i mentioned above, and like more than 90% of the population. there are only a few dudes in the world who became multi-millionaire with btc because they bought a lot when it was below 1k usd. since then, most of the people are just securing a good retirement plan (even if some of them burned everything in a lambo...).so what should you do ? is investing in btc really worth it, even if you will not buy a lambo? i still believe yes.if the price of btc is multiplied by 15 in the next two years, your investment, even as small as it, will also be multiplied by 15. this is still a good income.so, dont' burn all your savings, btc can still only go to 20k then dump again. and take your time to only invest what you can afford to lose.&amp;#x200b;tl;dr: the times when it was highly profitable to buy btc are gone a long time ago. stack stats with what you have, buy the dips when you can, and hodl. one of my transactions has said "unconfirmed" for 2 days now. trying to figure out how to push it through. i heard you can increase the fee? the math checks out. [removed] i traded a huge amount of ether for bitcoin in the exodus swap.the swap cancelled but never returned my funds.this account is backed by trezor hardware wallet. exodus was downloaded fromhere is a screen shot for the that went through but was cancelled and funds never returned.exodus support directed me to coinswitch support however it's been more than an hour.has this happened to anyone at all? [removed] had a group meeting today where a bunch of guys were talking about stocks, i got asked what i'm investing in these days and told them mostly bitcoin. this sparked a heated discussion.literally not a single one of them (group of about 12) took me seriously. they think bitcoin is too risky and don't take it seriously even though one of is down huge money on airline stocks.... unless i use bep2 or bep20 network, which i don't know.why is the fee so high? [removed] hi,i made a transaction using wasabiwallet 2 days ago.i sent bitcoin once, however i received 2 transactions, one large and the other one really small.&amp;#x200b;this one: [https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/16e27ee8fb28752a62861b4316f490c54ba76d718a6c610f0e9312678b91457b](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/16e27ee8fb28752a62861b4316f490c54ba76d718a6c610f0e9312678b91457b)its not been confirmed for 2 days now, is it stuck? because the fee is really low. if not how many days will it take to get cofirmed approximately.

(also, until i get another referral i'm having a return of 2%) so a few weeks back i was looking for btc atms around me just for curiosity's sake and when i came across coinflip i noticed they had a contest going where you could win btc. all you had to do was sign up for the newsletter to enter, so i figured what the hell.well, today i received this email:https://i.imgur.com/8kf5sbu.pngwhat do you think - is this legit? has anyone dealt with coinflip? is there any danger in giving out my info to them? your educated opinions are worth all the btc in the world to me. thank you in advance. let's just admit it:paypal = crypto for those who dont know where else to look and do not know what to do with it.[https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/paypal-bitcoin-is-big-news-for-crypto-but-exchanges-have-a-big-edge/](https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/paypal-bitcoin-is-big-news-for-crypto-but-exchanges-have-a-big-edge/) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/efficient-market_hypothesisi have a hard time wrapping my head around this with bitcoin and i know that price ultimately boils down to supply vs demand.how do ordinary redditors/investors explain the dip earlier this year when it went below $5k using emh?

[removed] [removed] on a recent sw us road trip i saw loads of gas flares. what are the factors to consider to pair btc mining with this wasteful practice?remote locations, natural gas, climate control, expandability, overall potential to to expand network? [removed] but the only 0's i'm seeing on my investments are the ones after the commas there is blue wallet for ios and androidplus the super good phoenix wallet for android only so far.many services are already accepting lightning payments and most are catching up.especially helpful with fee spikes like right now.use it if you haven't already and you will be amazed. some people stored their funds on a crypto exchange, which is not a good thing to do like a good bitcoin. some people believe that their cryptocurrency is much safer in exchange than their crypto wallet, this concept is a big no for me, well, in fact, i always read some articles about a hacked exchange every week or months. it is much safer to store our money in our crypto wallet but the problem with it is that it is also vulnerable to being stolen by hackers.we can prevent this thing from storing our private and public keys.just key terms to remember:**transferring of funds**public key - allows you to transfer funds into itprivate key - allows you to transfer funds out to it.**exclusively**public key - publicly known and important for identificationprivate key - this should be secret, excluded only for two parties which are the receiver and the sender.**if you lose your public key, you can still access it using your private key and if you lose your private key you cannot access your fund anymore.** storing your private key is a really important thing to do whenever you want to secure your wallet. do not store it on your device because any device ate prone to hackers. use any strategies except online. this might be a stupid question,  but can bitcoin ever become a usable currency. don't the excessively high fees which can't ever go to zero just name bitcoin inferior. a counter argument to this might be that inflation is a fee and credit cards also have fees.  but inflation doesn't feel real to most people because the amount of money they have stays the same and they much rather that happen then lose 5% or more on fees. for the credit card argument i'd say that credit cards have such small fees that they are almost not there while idk if bitcoin fees can go down that low. i'm 17 and i got my dad is allowing me to buy bitcoin and trade. i bought nano in april and doubled my $100 investment and then made a couple bad investments and i was left with 110 and bought bitcoin. i don't know what to do now as i need to make some money cuz of the holidays approaching but cant get a job as of covid. what should i do? i just started accepting crypto currency payments on our website and used blockchain(.)com as our wallet. then i started playing around on sending funds to another address and the first thing i noticed is the transaction fee, which is quite a bit high. i was just testing to send 45$ and the transaction fee is $5+ so i was wondering, is this transaction fee fixed on any amount? or is it a %/percentage of the total funds you're sending?sorry if this is a dumb question, it's my very first time diving into this thing and wanted to learn more. i've had this doubt for quite some time.why do large players just hit the market sell/buy with a crapton of coins/dollars instead of being stealthy?what do they actually gain from the large market disturbance? derivative manipulation? or just algos stacking?there's probably not a defined answer, but what's the cause the majority of the time?thanks! kind of newbie, should i sell before the election? will it tank or should i stay in? would love to hear some words of wisdom from people that know a lot more than me. thanks why should i buy $100 worth of bitcoin when it costs almost 1/10 to use it?this is stupid.everyone said segwit would fix this but it didn't. hallo guys i am a noob and i wanted to ask you if its normal that my ledger asked all of my recovery phrases and from all the youtube videos that i have seen it asks some words, is there any problem? [removed] new here   binance or coinbase for exchange ? hi guys ,help me in my situation...i have used two days ago [veroexchange - service](https://veroexchange.com/sell-bitcoins/)  to exchange fast my btc to paypal eur.i have found this site on google first's page . i have tryed to find any info about this site before to  request an exchange but didn't found any fraud results. so i have requested an exchange , received email from them where i should send my btc ( 5oo eur ). i sent them my btc , after an hour i received a email from them , that i need to send them my copy of id and selfie . i did it and after 6 hours more i got message that they required more documents with apostilles . i answered them wtf for exchange btc i will not do this and it takes to much time and more fees . after that i have asked cancel my exchange and refund my btc , but since my last email i haven't any answer from them and ofcause no btc back . what i could do ? especially , to avoid people use that service . regards i just read another post where someone says he bought a bit of bitcoin every day, which i found very interesting. could a person buy $5 a day, effortlessly? is there somewhere that will do this automatically for you?

[removed] [removed] here you see major hash decline:https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-ratehere you can see '1st spends' of bitcoinhttps://terminal.bytetree.com/bitcoin(i can't verify the accuracy of this).i've been watching 1st spends a while, averaging like 15,000 more bitcoins spent than mined for the last year. that's like $180 mil.first spends can only be done by miners. spending more than mined basically means they are spending from old blocks (like blocks that paid out 50 btc, 25 btc, 12.5 btc etc).there is some bonus value to first spend coins that i don't quite understand, but basically you get 10% or 20% more than the bitcoin value when you spend them, because they are completely untraceable or something like that. you can *sort of* trace bitcoins, but it's very, very hard to trace newly mined bitcoins until they are spent and linked up with other assets of said individual.so over the last year, someone has been liquidating these reserve bitcoins, while hash power of bitcoin has gone up like double from where it was and payouts have fallen in half, so mining is paying like 25% of what it was this time last year, when btc was $10k (presuming you stay on old equipment, etc.).i could imagine a situation where a btc bull holds these first spend coins for a long time, planning on a rapid price jump which takes a long time to materialize. and then combine that with he $3.5k corona / oil dip, which basically forced liquidated everyone on margin position (which bitcoin bulls tend to do), and i could see a scenario where someone had a wonderfully huge bitcoin position, and mining op, and then got all their free coins liquidated by margin call, and spent their '1st spend' coins to keep ops going, hoping for rapid price acceleration.this is all conjecture but i've been expecting something like this to happen. maybe it's just a blip, and i'm totally wrong, and hash climbs back up, but if it stays down and the btc price goes up, then i'm thinking a miner went busto, who had be applying $10's of millions of sell pressure monthly onto the system. [removed] we've come a long way since the days of cyber punks trading "magic internet money" for pizzas and alpaca socks.  and now at $250b market cap, i believe we are standing on the verge of what i expect to become an all out battle for monetary dominance against all other currencies and the governments that depend on them for survival.are we ready?  are they?...may the best money win [removed] three simple questions:1) what do you think will happen to btc price on the day of the election (nov 3rd) when results are still unknown? up? down? stable?2) once results eill be in, how do you think btc price will be affected by the winner?3) in any case, no matter who wins, its likely that a post election agreement for a relief/stimulus package will be reached between the two parties. this should push prices up anyway, would you agree?lets see who has the best crystal ball... [removed] [removed] until1 sat = 1 usdbitcoin is underpriced. hello, i have tried posting this on ther/binance, my post was deleted in seconds. my group in the app telegram, containing more than 130 individuals and myself, have suffered from deception by bull bear tokens in march 2020 on the binance exchange. this is exclusively on deception, not on improper trading! you can read in detail about deception on my website [binancescam.me](http://binancescam.me).at the moment, my group and i have exhausted all options to return our money, we were blocked everywhere by representatives of binance, blocked in social networks. aswell as for sorting it out in court, binance does not negotiate with us, they ignore our demands to start a lawsuit with us and to provide binance's data for the lawsuit. they won't even make their adress public.since march, we have seen token deception, attempts at forgery, false promises, and again deception! we saw an attempt at phishing and all possible sabotage of our group. many people have suffered, many do not even know that they have suffered from these tokens. below and on my website i will post a list of victims from our group only. binance exchange is a scam exchange that is not taking responsibility for anything. i lost my wife and my two children at this exchange. there were big plans for this money, they were intended for an operation this year. if you have any type of information or would like to help us, we will be very appreciative and grateful.kind regards i've probably read hundreds of pages and threads with varying answers, just curious to what you believe is "the best" cold wallet currently on the market?thanks bitcoin is a global phenomenon with millions of participants.you cant know what moved, is moving, or will move the price day to day, it's too complex.just focus on gradually accumulating satoshis (1 bitcoin is divisible into 100,000,000 satoshis) and learning about bitcoin. hi all. i sent a payment off yesterday evening from my wasabi wallet to another wallet, only to find the movement of funds has not been confirmed yet. i've used btc a bit in the past and never had a confirmation take so long and so i was wondering: why the transaction is taking so long to confirm and if anyone had any prior experience like this / any advice for hurrying the process along (if possible). cheers! we've seen a lot of struggle around 10k, both in usd$ and eur. with that hurdle cleared, what's the next one? i think 15k is going to be easy. then on to 20k, but the really big hurdle is probably 50k. and once we clear that, no one will bat an eye when it hits 100k.

[removed] if you own just one i'd say sell in quarters. when a quarter of a bitcoin can be sold and have a solid impact on your life, sell it. when you get to the last quarter remaining don't ever sell. that's enough to be in the top 1% in a situation it becomes the global reserve currency. if it doesn't become that, wait until it seems to have discovered it's stable price and either sit on it until retirement or sell it and use it to make more money elsewhere. hodl! ive heard about crypto being a big thing for years now and its fascinating how people are making so much money off of it. heck, i hear bitcoin is supposed to reach the 100 thousands, and supposedly paypal will be supporting bitcoin soon. maybe thats a place to start?how do i get into it myself? do you guys have any tips on trading? do you all think its worth it to get into crypto trading? also, what got you guys into it? [removed] it seems to me that one of the futures bitcoin may have would include being split into various derivative forms of itself. by this i mean it will be split into wbtc, renbtc, kycbtc(for china), btc etf (for wall st.), rbtc, sbtc, and polkabtc. at some point, it will be a throwback to own just regular ole btc [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] so, i know there are many stories out there like mine but i just wanted to thank everyone who have involved on bitcoin in any way and who have believed in the project and made it come all the way up here and i would like to share my story about how it changed my life.i have been checking bitcoin prices since 2011, back then i was a highschool kid and i wasn't aware of what really "blockchain" is. i just read about bitcoin and the idea was awesome to me and i started talking about it to everyone i know. back then price was like 100-200 usd if i am not mistaken. i was telling everyone that this is the future's currency and will change everything we know about the "money". sadly, i was just a kid at age 15 who had no access to any credit card or exchange website. i was just following the bitcoin price and that was all.later, when i start going to college, i was developing my programming skills and learning unix, server installations, configurations etc. back then people were hyped about "wordpress" and many people wanted to have a website, or a server that can run their websites etc. i was working as a freelancer and was asking people to pay me in bitcoins. i still remember as it was yesterday, the first time i got paid in bitcoins was for making a security check on a centos server and they paid me 0.3 btc at the time which worth around 400usd. i have done some other works, small/big whatever gives me money and had around 2.5 btc at the time. i was just a kid at age 19 and had 2.5 btc which worth around roughly 800-900 usd. i was so happy to have that type of money which i can use to shop online and it was my own money that i have worked for it. sadly, i spent all of it to get a new laptop at the summer except 0.6 btc. later my friends were planning a trip to another country and my parents didn't gave me any money, so i cashed the last 0.6btc and got around 600usd and went to the trip with friends, i was happy.till here, i was just a guy who was using bitcoin sometimes for getting payment from projects (i was working for people from other countries so btc was the easiest way to get paid). then i stopped working and focused more on my studies, till this august.august 2017, my father was unemployeed and my mother was also not working because my father was making enough money so she was just writing her blog, travelling around the country and resting after working for 20 years. when my father had to quit his job, we were just left with some small amount of money that would only keep us alive for maximum 4 more months. then i realized i had to do something and remembered the first thing that made me gain, bitcoin.i told my parents about bitcoin and the blockchain technology, explained them like they are five and my father said "well, son, this is the only money we have and i believe in you, do whatever you wanna do with it" and i took the money, invested 3/4 of it in bitcoin and kept the rest for daily expenses. i had like 1.5 btc at the time.i have spent hours and hours in front of computer and traded btc for altcoins and made around 4btc by mid september. i told my parents "listen, i am going to withdraw the 1.5 btc and keep the rest, maybe we can make more" and i just saw that btc was pumping up, so i said "no more trading" (for the people who trades, they know what i mean with it, while trading, you barely sleep, at least in my condition). i kept the rest 2.5 btc and thanks to god, it reached to 15-16k at the time i sold all of them.after succesfully doing these trades, reading more about crypto everyday and joining subreddits, facebook groups, i had bunch of "crypto" friends and one day one of them offered me a job at a website as a writer. i took the job and started writing, then a society at a local university called me to "talk" about bitcoin. after i had interviews with professors, economists and many more.i do not want to give any more details, but now, i bought myself a new phone, a new tablet for daily calculations and keeping track of the things, bought a second hand 2015 model car which is perfect for me. after all these things, i remembered that my grandfather had one wish to go to makkah (i am a muslim) and do umrah (a religious trip, mission, whatever you call). i knew this was his last chance to go because he has %70 disability (severe health problems). i called my grandmother and said "you wanna take a trip?" and she was like "where am i going to go?" and i said "to makkah" and she cried on the phone and said she just saw a dream and when she woke up, she said to my granddad "i saw it in my dream, but no way we can go there" (they are financially not that good).after all these things, whoever thinks it's a bubble and whoever thinks bitcoin is a scam, just read the story and see how it changed a person's life. i was believing in bitcoin since 2012 and after 5 years of knowing bitcoin, it finally significantly changed my life and made me the happiest grand-kid ever. i will keep supporting bitcoin and what it brings to our lives. i have achieved all these things thanks to everyone who believed in bitcoin and carried it to all the way up here. if you guys wouldn't believe it, now i would be calling friends and trying to borrow some money and my family would be having hard times. lets show the world what "decentralized" means, lets show them if we stand strong together, we can be stronger than their "centralized" banks and solutions. together, we can create a better future for our kids. again, thanks a lot to everyone and sorry for my english.

[removed] [removed] once bitcoin is bowling towards a new ath and the noobs start flooding in the same bedroom programmers that were pulling off scams 4 years back will begin forking the bitcoin repo and creating **the next shitcoins**.these coins will start pumping out shitcoins left right and center hitting you with buzzwords like **master-node**, **staking roi**, **ico**, **ieo**, **defi**, **instant transactions**, **partnerships**, **no fees**, **this coin will replace bitcoin**.it's important to know that only one single coin has persisted in the top10 over any extended period of time. every shitcoin had it's day, the devs dumped their coins that they gave themselves for free for the bitcoin you traded them and move onto their next project.every coin has and will fail to replace bitcoin, this will never change because bitcoin offers the single most important property that no other coin can *ever* offer. complete decentralisation from a single leading body or individual. [removed] reading this thread about the paypal news, i just had to give my opinion on it.this thread and the comments are just so full of wrong "facts".the whole premise of "*bitcoin doesn't scale*" has been discussed for **over 5 years** now and it's like some people here have simply decided to keep their eyes shut in hopes of their favorite coins valuation not being lost in the downward spiral that most altcoins have.is it that people here don't understand the lightning network, haven't used it, or simply refuse to accept it's development? i am genuinely curious. nowadays you can send and receive bitcoin within seconds. i can deposit as much bitcoin as i want on bitfinex within seconds regardless of onchain fees for less than 10sats.it is so infuriating because even those people critizing the layered approach to scaling see their favorite coin (most of the time thats eth) moving to a second layer scaling solution.i would be more than willing to write down how it works for anyone curious.please tell me, if so, why you haven't used lightning yet? please try lightning by using something like phoenix wallet or breez wallet. [removed] [removed] it isn't good enough simply to pick a winner (whether it's crypto or stock), you also need to sell in order to lock in some profit. since we can't time the top, consider employing a dynamic dca strategy.for example, the people i respect in this ecosystem, create price bands, and then sell a higher percentage of their holdings as the price enters each band. it effectively locks in profit and it's weighted so that you're selling more as the price of the asset rises.an easy way to think about this is to create a table, with the bands, and the amount to sell. divide your total holdings by 15 to get 'x', and then create 5 bands. for example, with btc i might create a table like this:|\&gt; $90k|1x||:-|:-||\&gt; $100k|2x||\&gt; $110k|3x||\&gt; $125k|4x||\&gt; $150k|5x|you can create more or less bands as you see fit. the point is to start thinking about this stuff now to avoid making emotional decisions in the future. i'm still accumulating, and it could take 1.5 - 2.5 years for this cycle to peak, but anything can happen and you need a plan to avoid seeing your investments contract 80% when this cycle ends.bitcoin is a winner, but crypto is very cyclical so don't forget to take some profits on the way up! [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] so many positive news coming today, i don't know how to react even i am so happy so i summarized all the top news today1. bitcoin 940 days new high: last time we have seen bitcoin above $13750 on 20 january 20182. bitcoin longest streak above $10k mark: the undisputed streak is still going and making me feel like $10k as a major support3. bitcoin market cap above $250 billion: currently btc mc is $254 billion, sitting at no.19 passed verizon4. singapore's major bank dbs is launching cryptocurrency:  on offer for trading against the singapore dollar, the hong kong dollar, japanese yen and u.s. dollar will be four top cryptocurrencies: bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and xrp.5. indian bank launching cryptocurrency to 34 branches:  unicas will allow united account holders to integrate cryptocurrency wallets directly with their accounts. customers will also be able to directly buy bitcoin (btc), ether (eth), ripple (xrp) and cashaa (cas) by paying either in cash or directly from their account. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i hope this doesn't get lost in the middle of all the meme posts and excitement, but here's a slightly more serious post. food for thought:- stop being so greedy.remember that this is a fairly risky investment (it doesn't feel like it because we are in a super bull market). are you okay with losing 60% of your investment? are you okay with losing 90% of it? even if you think so, know that people vastly overestimate their ability to handle downturns.no matter what you do, make sure that there will still be food on the table if your crypto investment goes to 0.- stop watching the damn charts and holdget out there and enjoy life. i'm a hypocrite because i spent more time on this sub than i've spent at work today, but the price will swing up or down whether you watch the charts or not. i bet most of you aren't actually trading - but you're glued to the charts due to all the excitement from btc taking off--but hey, you and i both knew it would take off.lastly, and by far the most important...- family, friends, loved ones should be the top priority in your life.if you're neglecting them and prioritizing staring at the price of your crypto coins, your priorities should be recalibrated. nothing matters more than those who give meaning to your life.thanks for reading and here's to hoping better 2021 than this shit of an year! [removed] hi guys, i'm concerned as i just got an email from uphold saying they've discontinued their partnership with cred, a crypto lending company. the details are tight and support is not saying much.anyone else using cred or has any more information on what's going on? this feels a bit sketchy. hello!i'm just beginning to learn about crypto currency, and how it functions.it's interesting to me how reddit is actually tying crypto currencies to sub-reddits. i've experienced this with bricks from r/fortnitebr, the price seems to have random spikes and then dips back down. i've never been actually interested by crypto currencies until now.what are just some beginner things that everyone should know and what common knowledge should i have? what are some things that interest you about crypto currencies and what should i be watching out for?thanks!

hello, i have a question on the bitcoin mining mechanism. suppose i have a bunch of mining equipment that is an important percentage of the overall mining hash rate in bitcoin: say, 30%. the bitcoin mining difficulty is 1 (to keep things simple).i come in with my super duper mining equipment and start mining. the bitcoin difficulty adjusts in a max of 2016 blocks (depending on when in the cycle i started mining) to also include my added hash rate.but now, once the difficulty increases, suppose i turn off my mining rig and let the other people mine on this higher difficulty. i have my equipment turned off, not consuming any power, waiting for the difficulty to drop as the network adjusts after another 2016 blocks. then, once that happens, i start mining again. that way i only mine, having to pay for the power that my mining equipment consumes, on lower mining difficulty. sure, i have that 2 week period when i don't mine but i'm not consuming power during that time, either.is there anything that i'm missing in this strategy to cheat the network? there is an argument i hear often that the fed has been manipulating people into believing inflation is coming to make people save less and invest/spend more because their savings account is now a depreciation account.if there is no stimulus passed post-election or if it is a very skinny stimulus, wouldn't the net effect of \~20% of total us money being printed in the past year all just be absorbed by the wealthy that profited in the stock market while the cpi will remain unchanged or even deflate?if this was the case how would it affect bitcoin? theres a bunch of mining games but they seem way too good to be true. are there any legitimate ones, or are they all scams preying on the desperate? i have 0 btc, but a lot of student debt. anything to help chip away. would you purchase a proper rugged case pendant with a beefy hook for paracord?

i hope this post will be a big lesson for those who are in the same situation as i was, as well as i am seeking for any advice that could help me through this tough times.so back in 2014 i first learned about bitcoin and i loved the idea of cryptocurrency so much, that in 3-4 years from learning about it when i became 18, i started investing and trading.as time went by i was investing small amounts, trading, and apparently slowly losing my money, but at that time it was ok because that were small amounts which i could afford to lose.in 2019 i moved from a poor country in europe, for a better life to london. i was working in london and by the end of 2019 i got almost 3k in btc, that were my savings.but then the worse started to happen, i loved trading, have read many books, got through tutorials, and was slowly trading my way up, and then i discovered the futures with up too 100x.at first i used low leverages, up to 10, then being greedy and not taking profits i always ended with losses, it started by losing small amounts, i was thinking let me put some more money in so i could trade what i lost back, i was getting emotional losing more and more, increasing leverages up to 75 rarely even 100. i was very upset with myself, at one moment  when i already lost 500 i said no stop, but one-two weeks passed and i again was depositing to trade, and this snowball was getting bigger as i was losing even more hoping i will get everything back and hodl.and right know i got a big life lesson, dont trade unless you can afford to lose that money, and never let your emotions in trading, i lost all my savings totalling about 5000, i go almost a 1000 debt. because i even used a credit card to load it up.i hate myself, because i could just hodl. and know not having a proper job due to covid, i have to survive somehow. this is how you learn a lesson the hard way, dont repeat my mistakes, just hodl and you will be fine.knowing that this community is huge, i would like to ask for some advice or tips, how should i deal with this in the future, how to forget this loss and move on(these 5000 were huge money for me).i m right now totally devastated, depressed and in kind of a dead end.i am teaching myself programming, and already pretty good at some languages, my little dream is to become a developer, or to open a successful business, but being in thus situation, its hard to find a job in it sphere, without having a degree or experience, so i would appreciate any help and advice to go the right path. there are definitely people here that make good money and have been through tough situations, i want to know whats your mindset and what was your journey.thank you for reading to the end! hodl and be smart. next time i will send with a higher fee. i tried to do little to no fees and here i am 2 days later still no confirmation.https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/9b0a8cfa3d5e8847da338429f81fff16d370e0981ab3db669841c64dd0f81fba if you're planning on using

how in mumble hell has this taken 5hrs without a single confirmation if miner pref is high? i seriously dont get it **tldr: would mixing btc acquired through a kyc exchange with btc acquired through bisq hinder privacy?**i'm hoping on some confirmation on whether i'm understanding things correctly. please, go ahead and let me know if i state something stupid below.john signs up in coinbase pro, goes through the kyc process and buys some btc from time to time. he sends the btc to an electrum wallet.because his btc where bought through coinbase, coinbase can identify john's wallet and potentially track all transactions following the initial removal of the btc from the exchange. also, coinbase can share that information with third parties, increasing the list of who could identify john's wallet and coin movements.now john sets up a bisq client and buys some btc from other peers in the bisq network. the btc is initially held in john's bisq wallet, but he proceeds to send them to the same electrum wallet where he previously sent the coinbase btc.questions:* could coinbase/third parties now also identify the btc bought through bisq as john's, and track further transactions?* if so, what approaches are available to john to keep his bisq-acquired btc anonymous?thanks for helping is gbtc the stupidest thing on the planet or is it a half decent investment?  i feel like it lowers

organize the queue by spoting non-uniformity on the mempool fee distribution and suggest fees for new transactions that would fill that gap. over time that produces a somewhat smooth fee distribution and a much more predictable fee market where parties can trully prioritize transactions, and thus have liveness on bitcoin.it is mempool depth-based (i.e., queue position), it is reactive. it uses recent past incoming transaction flows, and mined transcation outflows, to estimate velocities parametric on mempool queue position. based on block poisson statistics it then estimates when on average a transaction paying a given fee will be mined. error is multiplicative, so if you rely on these for liveness, please stay right at the surface.we don't have logs. the backend was commitioned by a

[removed] i've become convinced that btc is going to, at a minimum, 3x by december 2021. i also feel like i've put myself in an echo chamber, so looking for competing arguments.my thesis is that institutional investment will continue to grow and adoption will continue to increase, and 2021 is when that is set to explode. major companies are investing in bitcoin and they do not invest for the sort term. add in reduced supply - as more companies get in, this will drive up the price by itself. then add-in paypal, venmo, and their user base. this is where we are now. i've been waiting hours with 0 confirmations :( so hear me out. i know everyone's initial reaction would be to say "don't get a loan to buy bitcoin". but in my case, i have recently paid off all my outstanding debt. and i plan to start putting $500/month into savings/bitcoin anyway.my question is would it make more sense now that bitcoin is in it's uptrend again to get a $10k 36-month loan at 9% to buy bitcoin since i could get more total bitcoin now than investing over time as it's price goes up?i figure i will pay less every month for the loan than i would just putting my extra money into savings. i could actually pay this loan and put the additional into savings, or pay off the loan faster. and then come 2022-2023 after bitcoin has it's run up, i could just pay off the loan with whatever profit i made.i just see it as $10k potentially turning into $70k in a few years. i have the money to invest anyway, but i wind up with more bitcoin this way. thoughts? hi, i'm waiting for a refund and it's been 2 days and still unconfirmed the position in the mempool is 24.02 mb from tip, is this normal and is there anything i can do? i'm starting to worry. so we are crashing twice as hard today to make up for it!usd is up, everything else is crashing hard.  this is ugly.

[removed] [removed] a problem with airdrops in general is that if a specific airdrop causes a large population to suddenly receive "free" cryptoassets, and there is a trading market for those assets, what can often transpire is a sudden flood of holders trying to sell their airdropped tokens immediately to lock in their gains.  this isn't surprising.but is it preventable?well, one of the cool things about cryptocurrencies is that they are basically programmable assets.  therefore, could a project be creative and tailor their airdrop to limit the downside of a sudden mass liquidation that crashes a market?  yes, i believe so.example.  an organization decides to do an airdrop.  can the airdrop be set up so that in addition to the tokens being deposited into wallets, each airdropped award gets a random time stamp stored with the tokens.  the "random time stamp" is basically a data field which takes the date of the airdrop and adds a number of days (based upon a random number generator at the time of airdrop) between 1 and 365, to come up with a new arbitrary randomized date within 1 year of the airdrop.  then, if the code for the project does not allow a trade on any tokens to happen before the date associated with those particular tokens, it means that most of the airdropped tokens cannot be sold/traded immediately after the date of the airdrop.  instead, the airdropped tokens are gradually released over the course of 365 days following the airdrop (of course, you could program any unlock/release schedule that you want, including straight-line, accelerating, decelerating, starting and ending at x and y time post-airdrop, etc.this would do a lot to reduce selling pressure.i was just thinking about this because a lot of airdrops turn out to be garbage, but for a creator that really cares about their project, coding something creative like this into the project may be beneficial.we have programmable money.  let's code some cool ideas.

[community points](https://reddit.com/community-points) are a way for users to be rewarded for their contributions to the subreddit, and they can be used on premium features in the community.moons are distributed every 4 weeks based on contributions people make to r/cryptocurrency. for every distribution, reddit publishes karma data as a default measure of contribution. the community can review the data and optionally propose an alternative distribution, if they wish.this distribution is based on karma earned from 2020-09-30 to 2020-10-27. [here is the data.](https://reddit-meta-production.s3.amazonaws.com/distribution/publish/cryptocurrency/round_6_proposed.csv)to propose an alternative distribution:* you can create a csv with alternative contribution scores or propose changes to the algorithm used to calculate them from karma (as long as the changes can be implemented easily).* the amount of moons distributed to a user will be proportional to their contribution score. contribution scores cannot be negative.* make a poll to have the community vote on your proposal. include an accurate description of the changes you are proposing.* if the poll meets quorum (20% of moons need to vote in it) and passes (according to the weighted results), it becomes the official contribution measurement (unless there is evidence of abuse in the vote, such as bribery). algorithm changes will carry forward to future distributions.* in case of multiple polls passing, the one with the most moons cast in favor will be the official one.* if no alternative passes, the data provided here will become official.the contribution scores for this round will be finalized on 2020-11-04. any poll proposing an alternative needs to be completed by then.after the scores are finalized, reddit will sign the data and publish the final, official data. after that, people will be able to claim their moons through the vault in the reddit mobile app. interesting read on machine learning with crypto weaved in. what are some of your thoughts on how ai and ml are going to affect trading in the future?"in a recent [article](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-neednt-fear-gpt-3-it-should-embrace-it), i discussed the relevance of the machine learning techniques powering the famous [openais gpt-3](https://openai.com/blog/openai-licenses-gpt-3-technology-to-microsoft/) could have for the crypto market. gpt-3  which can answer questions, perform language analysis and generate text  might be the most famous achievements in recent years of the deep learning space. but, by no means, is it the most applicable to the crypto space. in this article, i would like to discuss some novel areas of deep learning that can have a near immediate impact in the quant models applied to crypto.models such as gpt-3 or googles bert are the result of a massive breakthrough in deep learning known as language pretrained and transformer models. these techniques, arguably, represent the biggest milestone in the last few years of the deep learning industry and their impact hasnt gone unnoticed in capital markets."[https://medium.com/@eduardmason/machine-learning-methods-for-crypto-traders-a0df1e99419f](https://medium.com/@eduardmason/machine-learning-methods-for-crypto-traders-a0df1e99419f) [removed] [removed] im not sure what to make of it. im sure most people on this sub will immediately want to go to the narrative that they just know theyre late to the party and are now trying to hop on, but i cant shake the feeling theres more to the story.when i see jp morgan claiming massive upside to bitcoin, after shutting on it for years, it makes me concerned. they have a remarkable history of telling the public one thing, and then screwing them the next day. could they be getting ready for a rug pull of some sort?if there were a a massive crash with fleeing to bitcoin, could outrageous fees for first time users like boomers trying to save their retirements turn people off of bitcoin? could wef and ecbs major focus on green digital tech be a signal that bitcoin isnt the solution they want moving foward?im not sure how this all plays out, and at the end of the day the network is there and theres nothing anyone can do about it, but i do find it strange how some of the most untrustworthy people are now promoting bitcoin. i also have concerns about how the network would respond if millions of people were trying to flee to safety, leaving a sour taste in peoples mouths.thoughts? [removed] [removed] hey everyone.  back in january i launched [a crowdfunding campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cmdq/blackpage-a-social-network-for-the-command-line/description) for a social network that would operate entirely within the command line.  well it didn't work out, and i've since merged the tech into other projects.  and then someone told me that turning that old idea into a proper exchange (apparently like uniswap) would be a cool idea.  considering that the platform could support any bitcoin-derived cryptocurrency with just a few clicks on the backend i could make that happen.  eth would take just a bit more work but is easy enough.the proposition is expensive though.  and i couldn't even hit my mark for the original idea ($800 in hosting).  so my question is, would this be something that anyone would actually use?  the gist is, no kyc, no email required, a reddit-like ui with a tor + i2p search engine (because why not?) etc. privacy:cant ever be stopped if truly decentralised.will always have demand as long as it has value.can be banned from any centralised platform.defi:make money by just hodling.could change the financial world.new and open to scams and vulnerabilities, the rug pull.currency:control taken away from banks, governments and centralised authorities.banking for the unbanked.many years away.smart contracts:autonomous.links the real world to blockchain.can take out the middle man and save costs. [removed] one of my only alt coin holdings at the moment (other than eth, if you call that an alt-coin is bnb).  i thought it would be handy to do a quick post on why bnb is, in my opinion, still a great hold going forward.first of all, you can't argue with bnb in its of its previous price action.  out of the coins on offer during 2017, only link and bnb have outperformed btc.  in fact, on 1 january 2018, btc was around the same price as now ($13,200) - while bnb was $8.51 - so that is a near quadrupling in price.  bnb is also not far off its ath price of $39.68 - and only 25% down from its ath (compared to 35% for btc).i believe the ico price was 10 cents, so enough said - if you are an early ico buyer you probably aren't reading this and are living the good life somewhere!so here are some of the reasons i hold bnb, and the utility that it gives you:1) the buyback.  every quarter binance takes a portion of its profits, uses that to buy back bnb tokens, and then burns the tokens reducing the supply.  its like the opposite of ripple dumping their tokens on you each month.  and last quarter we had the biggest burn in history - imagine if that continues.2) fees - holding even a small amount of bnb gives you a fee reduction to all trades, which are then used to give you a trading discount.  that bnb effectively pays for itself.3) staking - you can currently stake a range of new coins, and redeem at any time.  that gives you a continuous income stream from those assets, with aprs up to 45% (on top of your bnb gains).4) launchpad lotteries - hold bnb (even if you are staking) and you qualify for lotto tickets to the ieos.  ieos are a pretty good bet if you can get a winning ticket.  in the last round i won a single ticket to invest in the inj ieo, i purchased this using bnb and sold on day 1 for an instant 121% return (even now holders are still up from 40c to 67c).i feel like cz always has the price of bnb and investors at the front of his mind and is doing his best to provide as much utility as possible to binance coin holders.  think of the bnb token as the closest proxy you can get to investing into shares in binance itself, and then think of the opportunity to invest in amazon or ebay in its earlier days.

[removed] i really don't understand folks and upvotes/downvotes on here. its almost as if people go out of their way to take away your upvotes or jump on a bandwagon when something is upvoted. ive been on reddit long enough to see what its like in other subreddits but it just seems ridiculous on here with these moon rewards being a factor. im wondering which potential use cases or areas of application for blockchain do you still think are underserved?of course, one could argue that blockchain is not close to be super useful in the majority of the current tackled use cases (like supply chain tracing, defi etc.), but this will come with time.im more interested to hear about what applications do you think need more attention? for me it is voting for example. cred, the lending service heavily promoted by uphold, is missing corporate funds due to fraudulent activity and is being investigated by authorities according to [coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/cred-says-fraudulent-activity-led-to-loss-of-funds-law-enforcement-investigating).theyve shut down all inbound and outbound transactions. uphold has inexplicably cut ties with cred in an effort to distance themselves from the situation - as if dan schatt, ceo/founder of cred, is not on the board of directors at uphold.they do mention, cred still has the ability to fulfill redemptions to uphold user accounts if they choose to do so. uphold support is directing users to contact cred directly for clarification. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i know there have been posts about this in the past but its getting extremely frustrating.the amount of random memes and utter shitposts that have popped up since the whole moons distribution is getting ridiculous. this subreddit used to be a good place to come to talk to other crypto fans, discuss and just have a foot in the crypto space.im not entirely sure how one would put a stop to the shitposts coming through, maybe tweaking rules? increasing required karma? stricter rules? just anything to get this subreddit good again [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] im interested in setting up a gekko bot on my kraken account but im a bit worried about security as im mostly new to crypto.i dont have much invested right now so risk is pretty low but even then i guess i need a bit of reassurance before opening my exchange account to a random piece of software on the internet...gekkos rating on github is pretty high so thats comforting but any experience you may give would be great !thanks for your help ! [removed] [removed] hello fellow kids.yesterday i was reading my countrys most popular newspaper and was greeted with the headline hacker demands cryptocurrency!!. naturally my interest was grabbed and i went on reading the article that stated the hacker demands the private and untraceable cryptocurrency bitcoin, which is obviously wrong since bitcoin is a public ledger and every single transaction is recorded and saved for eternity.mildly annoyed i emailed the author of the article and explained that bitcoin is in fact not very private, and certainly not untraceable. after a few back and forth with relevant facts the newspaper issued a correction saying bitcoin is indeed not very private and is traceable.this is what we, the cryptocurrency community, must do every time we see people outside the community reference crypto the wrong way. i urge you all to take a few moments out of your very busy life following shitcoins to correct newspapers and other publications when they simply misinform the public.the result of their misinformation leads to the public associating cryptocurrency with crime, and this must change.please, pretty please, do this. it does not take long, and we all do benefit from it. a few months back i was banned for a week for posting too many articles from one source. they were unrelated topics but from the same decrypt source. i served my ban and changed my posting behaviour as a result because i enjoy being part of this community.its somewhat ridiculous to see that motherfuckers can come up in here and spam it all to hell and not be banned for even a week while some deserve a permanent ban because theyre only here to manipulate karma and farm moons. its very obvious to all who is here to farm moons and who is here because they like the sub and engage in the community. i saw one guy had the same post reposted 4 or 5 times with various levels of upvotes on each one.sure, i have a lot of moons and a lot of karma but i spent a lot of time in this sub helping others, sharing news and sharing my opinions. it can be noticed that my comment karma is also high, not just post karma. i engage and i discuss with people because thats what this place is for.im ranting. im venting and yes im complaining. im not worried about moons for myself i hardly post anything anymore. im worried that the sub is being ruined by spammers and its no longer the helpful sub it used to be.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] the problem is there are more than one token/coin filling a certain niche in the crypto market (e.g. eth/neo, if i'm not wrong) and, as usual, only one will end eventually up occupying it. i think it would be radically important for a crypto investor to know exactly what each of the altcoins do so that to assert its viability on long term. [removed] [removed] perfect timing for this impending bull run that all crypto holders will enjoy no matter what bag they're holding.nothing stopping the crypto community partying like its 1969 when we all get there. even bitcoin sv holders, everyone welcome. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i just completed all those reward tasks on coinbase and got around 40 in celo, compound, stellar and maker.im sure a lot of people just sell them off and buy other coins, but is that a good plan of action? my portfolio currently is 99% bitcoin and thats where my interest is.anyone got any predictions for these others? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i'm wondering if there are any exchanges our there that make taxes easier. with stock brokerage accounts, you can get a 1099 at the end of a calendar year, which makes filing taxes possible. i have yet to find a crypto exchange that provides this, so i'm asking if anyone knows any.if no exchanges provide tax docs, do you have any tips on filing taxes if you trade a lot? i'm guessing keeping good records is the most important, but wondering if anyone out there has a good system they'd be willing to share.as i said in the title, i'm referring to taxes in the us, but if you have a good system for another country and want to share that, it's always interesting to hear! [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i hope this doesn't get lost in the middle of all the meme posts and excitement, but here's a slightly more serious post. food for thought:be as greedy as possible.remember that this is the most important investment of your lifetime. (it doesn't feel like it because jpowell has been pumping stockmarkets and rampantly printing money to stave off a deflationary spiral). are you okay with sitting on the sidelines when your stock investments lose value in comparison to the hyperinflation occurring aroind you? are you okay with owning only 0.1 btc at a million dollars when you could have bought 1 for $14k? even if you think so, know that people vastly overestimate the ability of the government to control and issue money. no matter what you do, make sure you own enough crypto to where there will still be food on the table if your government keeps debasing its money.the next 14 months, you must stare at charts 24/7you will not have time to get out there and enjoy life. i'm not a hypocrite because i know in 2016 xrp and xlm both pulled massive rises in btc in short periods of time before retracing and then mooning again, allowing for opportunites of 1000x gains if the timing was eight. the price of alts will always swing up or down so you must constantly watch charts especially btc and eth pairs to maximize your profits. i bet most of you aren't actually trading - but you're glued to the charts due to all the excitement from btc taking off--but hey, you and i both knew it would take off. you must trade. do not let an altcoin go to ath in sats without selling. alts always retrace.lastly, and by far the most important...family, friends, loved ones should be put on the backburner this year. theyve listened to you talk about crypto for years now yet wouldnt even invest $20 a week like you begged them to. fuck em. they will get left in the dust. if your opinion was worth a shit to them, theyd be by your side right now. they arent, so fuck em. the next year will literally define how the rest of your life plays out. you must not squander a single moment.if you're neglecting them and prioritizing staring at the price of your crypto coins, your priorities should be recalibrated. any time focused on family is too much. nothing matters more than the opportunity to escape a life of wage slavery and aunt karen complaining to you about how the neighbor is breaking their hoa will do nothing but cause you stress and bring you down.thanks for reading and here's to hoping better 2021 than this shit of a bear market! [removed]
UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// [removed] from my understanding the private key is what actually holds your coins and it is mathematically tied to the public key. i use the exodus wallet and everytime i click on receive, it shows your public key but i noticed that its always a different public key once coins are sent to it (btc). i guess my question is how many public keys can be derived from a private key? and why isn't it just one public key for the private key? also dose this happen on other blockchains as well? thanks for the help! not a rhetorical question. i had my post removed and someone reported me as a scammer even though there was nothing remotely solicitous in the post.if you care about bitcoin you should be able to talk about the political issues that affect it most greatly, including the politics of bitcoin itself. maximalism should not be the default position of the largest reddit group for the coin. there are severe political consequences to maximalism and severe concerns about censorship and the recreation of censorial governmental type behavior.maximalism is a real thing, and it is a bad thing. it is not something that describes pro bitcoin people, it is a doctrinaire political commitment to protectionist prevailing imperial dictatorial behavior to enrich whoever could push a central theme that enriches their holdings, this is especially true for the rich in america, and in fact it helps extend american exceptionalism and supremacy. [removed] which is the most efficient way to do so; purchasing bitcoin monthly in a bigger chunk or spreading it out weekly? im talking about using an atm btw. [removed] got btc using no kyc via samurai walletmixed it using whirlpool(aka coinmixing).now i have 4 txos, 3 mixed outputs and 1 non mixed for change.2 questions, how do i proceed to move them to my trezor wallet?im assuming i send 3 of the mixed outputs into 3 different recieveing addresses.what about my 1 non mixed txo? its still a hefty amount but not enough to mix by itself.what do i do and is what im doing seem correct for privacy?also when i spend, do i have to mix it back to my samurai wallet so it cant be traced to my hardware wallet?thanks it was only a matter of time until a weak economy with severe inflation made a similar move. but im curious how this changes the uss (short-term) view of bitcoin. you have a country determined to defy us sanctions not only preserve its native currency, but to actively pursue nuclear programs.what makes this even more of a mixed bag though is that theyre a proponent of cyber warfare...advocating the narrative...theoretically also protecting the space against their own cyber attacks...seems like you gain an ally and deter other countries at the same time. big supporter of the space but curious how this will play out. would be great to get some thoughts! [removed] **bitcoin!** the chronfather is a really nice dude actually what a world we live in... i never thought as a kid i would be able to buy bagged poop on the internet [removed] hello,i have been dealing with coinbase pro for nearly two months, i sent them everything i have about my business and yet they still ask for more and more documents.being a bit pissed, i decided to move to bit2me to whom i sent all the required documents. the issue, they ask for the origin of funds.which funds? i only want to accept btc as a payment in our business. they replied that that's fine but that i had to ask my customers for the origin of funds ?? i found that to be ridiculous and intrusive.funny thing is, i do not even have any funds yet so there is nothing to be proven, their response is that if i can't justify the origin of funds i can't open an account with them.&amp;#x200b;i tried coinmama and everything seems to be ok, i got verified real quick but did read some bad stuff like funds getting locked after they track certain wallets from gambling sites or some short, can anybody clarify if this is true?&amp;#x200b;i'm from europe, is there no way for me to accept btc legitimately without having to be that intrusive with the customer? i would not buy anything if a shop asked me to prove the origin of my cash lol. will bitcoin replace gold as the backup for world currencies? it would be the perfect fit, a blockchain gold standard for a 21st century world. serious question. i understand the significance of blockchain technology and how a decentralized financial and record keeping system could change the world.my question is what makes you so sure that in a year or so the price of bitcoin wont be lower than what it is now? lets not act like that we would be this interested without the financial incentive.why wouldnt the government ban it? why wouldnt it just fizzle out or another coin take over?these are question i myself have but also are questions i keep running into. what do you guys say to that? i know the deal. not your keys, not your coin.but im looking for the best custodial option if one insisted on that method.a wealthy person i know (over 65yo) wants to buy 10 or so btc and told me he planned to use sofi. i looked into them and theyre just middle-manning coinbase with an extra 1.25% fee.what is a better, more trusted custodial option?and it cant be something like keys.casa thats multi-sig and still makes him keep track of private keys.hes old and used to trusting institutions. cant we let him buy despite this?is the only option an exchange like coinbase/kraken?thanks i try showing chicks my diverse portfolio but they seem to respond better to bitcoin, especially after my $40 investment went up to $46 . eth gets them the wettest but they come on to me more with bitcoin. what coins do you guys show women to get them hot and bothered?? hey bitcoiners! this is my first ever post! after months of debating i finally bought a ledger..im debating whether or not to transfer all my dividend investments into bitcoin instead, im 22 and not sure what to do! i get roughly 100 a year from my dividends which isnt much but adds up!i was thinking of investing monthly into btc instead of vanguard top 500 dividends.i was wondering what you guys and girls would suggest doing? thanks! trying to help a friend out getting some btc but they had used a btc atm without telling me anything and they went ahead and did it themselves and got them saved onto a paper wallet instead of sending it to mine.the qr code got all messy so it can't be scanned but i have the mnemonic (letters/numbers) saved. any app i can use to get them out of the paper wallet using the mnemonic? hi everybody.i'm quite new to the bitcoin world. and i'm going slowly.i've been trading a little bit in bitmex.i would like to know if there are any issues for uk residents to use bitmex.i have also created an account with koinly and added all my wallets, etc. so it is calculating my earnings and eventually, it will give me the tax report for the uk.is anyone using these two platforms (bitmex + koinly) if you do, please let me know how you are doing.any other comments regarding bitmex, bitcoin, and uk tax are welcome.thanks!! hi all,in the past week ive basically yolod my entire life savings into btc  and my only regret is not doing it sooner.storing it in blockfi and collecting 6% annual interest paid in btc seems like an incredible opportunity (and i expect that once btc moons, theyll cut the rate....).does anyone else store a large amount of crypto on blockfi? what i mean is if a transaction is taking too long is it better to just wait it out if i'm already days in or it doesn't work like that? [removed] if this has been asked a few times im sorry but if i wanted to spend 100k to get back into mining whos miners do i want to buy? i bought a bitcoin via bitcoin atm, and the machine asked me to provide 2 id and take pic of me.where does these data store? and am i anonymous with this bitcoin i bought? what is your advice to protect my privacy.

"if we take the same measures as china, everyone will be ruined" "oh ! so you are for communism ?" "they are the ones that gave us this problem and you want us to take a lesson frol them ?" and so on... my honest opinion is that countries like france are banking too much on the famous vaccine ! they want to make everyone stay home for a month in the hopes that we will have 5k contaminations per day instead of 40k to 50k currently. all that so we can maybe have a christmas... am i the only one that thinks this is insane ? am i the only one to think most countries are taking this pandamic a little too lightly ? why put the economy before the health of others when we can print to oblivion like we have been ? 7.5 trillion dollars in the usa, 2.5 trillion in the eu, and i'm not sure about the asian countries.. but its got to be up there.with that said, the usa is in no better spot right now. we will again print to oblivion for stimulus round #2. so here is my question to you all:will we see another market wide dump soon ? will investors world wide panic ? the vix panic index is already looking worrysome. the cac40 (equivalent of sp500) is looking oh so bearish.anyways, everyone, take care of yourselfs, your families and your health and get ready for round #2 of confinnement.. serious question.so imagine that you are moving because the country you live in is a mess, or it's about to become a mess, and you decide to move abroad.how do you take your seeds with you in the safest way?you cannot take your seedplate with you in a bag. i thought about different options:1) you travel to your new destination, and create a new wallet, seedplate and an address there, return to your previous destination, send your bitcoin there, and move to your new destination. the problem is that you need to travel twice.2) you write your seed in the different pages of a book, or underline words of the book you carry with you. the problem is that you can always lose the book.thoughts? i will have  most my bitcoins on my  hardware walletbut i want have small amount bitcoin/fiat on my  exchange app   for fast sell or buy   is safe to have on kraken app ? or how do ppls fast trade / sell for small profit ? i received a refund for my car tax recently and it was in the form of a cheque along with the letter itself. the amount was 22.50gbp, nothing to write home about but enough to make me want to cash it in.so i finish work at 2pm, i go home and get sorted. i park up at the town centre, pay the 1gbp parking and walk round to the bank. to my dismay i find the bastard is closed! i check the time and it's 3.40pm, the closing time on the door was 3.30pm (adjusted opening hours due to covid).i know i should have checked the opening hours before i went down. i'm just annoyed because now i'll need to go down on one of my days off during the week and it just feels like it isn't even worth the effort.i was just wondering if anyone else has experience any bank related annoyances during the pandemic. beginner eu binance or kraken or coinbase ? [hivewallet.com](https://hivewallet.com) is gone help i have all my life saving in bitcoin 2015 need to recovery got my seed where do i get hive wallet what is deriviation pathhelp me pls read one opened in texas but 30m invested. anything else on a smaller scale anyone heard of ? it will be at least 2 trillion and more likely 3 trillion, but up to 4 trillion under biden, democrat house and senate (most likely to flip).the situation is desperate in the us with food banks unable to supply all the people in need and the tens of millions that can't pay their rent anymore. unemployment remains extremely high, businesses closing and bankrupting on record numbers.all this in the middle of the pandemic breaking records of infections with 41 states reporting an increase in cases and health experts predicting that it will get much worse in the weeks and months coming.then, it's not a matter of 'if', but when those trillions are going to flood the economy, including the direct payments (most likely larger than the $1,200 one) to individuals, and we know where that check is going for many as soon as it comes. i've just started on this.and i got 30 on crypto thanks to coinbase. but i don't know if coinbase is the most secure , or if there are other ways to keep my btc safe. most people don't realize that if they held btc in december of 2019 when a snapshot was taken--they are entitled to a % claim of the airdrop for hex. there's only two weeks left to have the claims fulfilled, at which point the remaining value in unclaimed btc is distributed.this is not exactly btc, but because it's something only holders can do it seemed most relevant here. there's 0 risk to claiming your free hex &amp; you can always sell for btc right afterwards. prove me wrong i feel that every time i turn around i see that bitcoin is beating stock market growth of some index  (s&amp;p 500 ,dow jones, etc.) i think this is a silly comparison since realistically if someone is savy enough to invest in bitcoin then odds are good that they're savy enough to think of investing in any given big name tech stock. most of these given stocks have outpaced bitcoin percentage growth when comparing over the past year. by comparing to stocks at all i feel people are making the argument that bitcoin is a better investment when it simply hasn't performed this way (in the past year). bitcoin has its merits, but its being lifted up as a get rich or grow wealth strategy that it simply hasn't turned out to be. even touting the money that large companies have made by investing in bitcoin is flawed when realistically they would have made much more by investing in numerous other companies. i guess it just doesn't feel like a very convincing angle to bring in new users and is a little dishonest in its comparisons. granted i love bitcoin for its other concepts. it is absolutely great to see that bitcoin is rising but once again the mempool is stuck with transaction fees rising to almost $5 and more. transactions with low fees are getting stuck for days and still not confirming.some people argue that if you want quick confirmation then use lightning network, but the truth is that lightning network is not that widely supported, it good for microtransactions and still risky.is there no solution to bitcoin's rise in fees every time its price rises?anyhow if your transaction is stuck in the mempool, you can check the status using a block explorer that also gives you an *estimate* of confirmation time.* [mempool](https://mempool.space/)* [blockonomics](https://www.blockonomics.co/)before sending a bitcoin transaction it is always advised to send the appropriate fees if you want to have it confirmed quickly, wallets now usually give you an estimate of the fees along with the corresponding confirmation time.you can still check for an estimate of the fees here:* [bitcoin fees](https://bitcoinfees.net/)* [bitcoin congestion manager](https://fee.cryp.ee/#/btc)* [bitcoiner](https://bitcoiner.live/)if your transaction is stuck you can either wait or use a transaction accelerator like:* [bitaccelerate](https://bitaccelerate.com/)* [btc transaction accelerator](https://pushtx.btc.com/)* [viabtc](https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/) [removed] at some point something has to give. by that i mean, even the crypto exchanges are going to say we are no longer willing to give you crypto for usd, it just doesnt make sense for us anymore. if/when this happens, would it be a sudden transition? would it be beneficial for governments and major corporations to not give fair warning to the general public that this may happen? i would like to hear different opinions on this please. thanks in advance. https://www.trustnodes.com/2020/10/29/iran-changes-law-to-use-bitcoin-for-importsnot posting this for moons or whatever just read it. thought it was quiet interesting. btc pulls back from the $14,000 area, tone vays views this positively for the price to challenge $20,000.&amp;#x200b;the price of bitcoin has pulled back after printing a fresh 52-week high earlier in the week.&amp;#x200b;the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization has dropped towards the $13,000 level after approaching the $14,000 mark on wednesday.&amp;#x200b;trader tone vays shared his views on this correction in his most recent episode of the trading bitcoin show:&amp;#x200b;"this pullback from the $14,000 area is very healthy. and the deeper the pullback without getting to $10,000, the more healthy it is for the bull market."&amp;#x200b;as a potential scenario where the price could go lower, tone pointed out:&amp;#x200b;"$11,500 is ideal, $11,000 is ok. below $11,000 gets us into a little bit of a pickle. but the closer this pullback gets to $11,000 without breaking this level, the healthier it is for bitcoin to challenge $20,000 sooner rather than later."&amp;#x200b;[https://bloxlive.tv/video/ody4ng==/btc-drops-from-the-14k-area-tone-vays-views-this-positively-for-the-price-to-challenge-20k](https://bloxlive.tv/video/ody4ng==/btc-drops-from-the-14k-area-tone-vays-views-this-positively-for-the-price-to-challenge-20k)&amp;#x200b;according to coinmarketcap website, btc trades at just over $13,000 on a daily decline of 3.45%.&amp;#x200b;watch the full episode of the trading bitcoin with tone vays for more market insights:&amp;#x200b;[https://bloxlive.tv/video/ody3mw==/trading-bitcoin-is-a-1k-btc-pullback-enough](https://bloxlive.tv/video/ody3mw==/trading-bitcoin-is-a-1k-btc-pullback-enough) i think about start doing fiat to crypto and crypto to fiat do i will need pay tax if i will make around 100-300$ profit every months ? hi, so i just read a crypto horror story about emails and exchange accounts being compromised by identity theft aka sim swapping and cryptos being stolen. so i just called my phone provider and added a second security question for the case of someone trying to do the sim swapping.the lady told me that anyone who has the pincode for my phone provider could theoretically do the identity theft. so my suggestion to everyone in the cryptospace is to call up your provider and ask for an added security layer in form of a question only you know the answer to.have a good day and keep hodling! :) simply bitcoin, a channel that breaks down all the daily bitcoin news. from twitter to important updates to cringy daily fails we have it alldaily fail!meme review!daily news!daily software releases![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmhcqqkyh\_e&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmhcqqkyh_e&amp;feature=youtu.be) [removed] [removed] [removed] i sent a transaction 28 hours ago, which is still unconfirmed.first i was able to see it on blockstream . info (block explorer), now it says transaction  not found.electrum suggested a fee of over 200 sat/byte but i used 50 sat/byte...id was:  c69d11978b3b587458245c456893823d0b3536fca7e467a0ff2a0f951b672aeewhat do i do now?? i will often think of gaps in my security posture and ways to improve it. i would like to see what threads other people are thinking of, and if the gaps i'm perceving are valid, already thought of, or just excessive paranoia.besides the common "cold storage" and "not your keys, not your coins" security advice, i would love to see what other tidbits do you do, or have thought of that could be potential security weaknesses.&amp;#x200b;a few that come to mind:1) is it safe to keep your funds in the address provided at time of withdrawal to your exchange?asking because if an exchange employee were to access unauthorized data, you could potentially know how much coins each person has, by just scanning the withdraw addresses. this could make you a real life target.2) is it smart to use a separate email (non-hotmail,google,yahoo) for exchange related work.2) is it safe to combine multiple addresses into one?

you can have only wallet only bitcoin you cant have money [deleted] people often speak of bitcoin having its roots in the cypher punk community, but i view bitcoin has having multiple roots that only became a viable currency when these roots merged.  the technical contributions of the cypher punks are tremendous, but perhaps even more significant is bitcoin's roots in austrian monetary economics.throughout the history of humanity, there has been tremendous struggle over money with government consistently growing to take control of the money supply--and it's creation.  this happens today in the form of keynesian central banks expanding the money supply to finance the endless desire of government to spend and consume beyond what it would be able to without the ability to create new currency units at negligible cost.  but this keynesian practice was common throughout history as well, of course it was known by a [different names then](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/methods_of_coin_debasement), but it was keynesianism all the same.wherever productive and free people managed to save any significant wealth for the future, government would soon show up to start eating it away with keynesian debasement, like rats showing up to help themselves to some cheese someone else labored to create.there was of course people who rejected the keynesian theft-apologist ideology.  the austrians called out the keynesian governmental theft and exposed the harm a society suffers from allowing these intrusive government rats to consume whatever stored wealth they please, but things did not play out well for the austrians.  any time there was an attempt by the austrians to create a money that was immune from keynesian appropriation government would [promptly stamp out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/executive_order_6102) this monetary competitor and [often the lives of whatever austrians were associated with it's enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberty_dollar_(private_currency)).  keynesian money does not fair well in the marketplace with competitions so governments that rely on keynesian money for for their existence cannot allow such competition.and so whenever austrians attempted to challenge keynesian monetary supremacy they were completely and utterly annihilated.  keynesian money had allowed government to grow in size and power into something analogous to a death star--a monstrosity of war and death with limitless capacity for destruction.  any attempt at a direct head-on assault or open challenge is doomed to certain failure.  but just as a death star is designed around and completely dependent on a core, so to is government designed around completely dependent on a keynesian money core from which it draws all of its power to fund and sustain itself.  there is no death star without the keynesian core.  and all of the austrians efforts to take out the core had failed.  but then someone wrote and released a tiny piece of code--an imperceptible threat at first, but a threat in the form of a tiny new money that challenges the keynesian monopoly.  an austrian money that cannot be killed.this austrian money has been steadily and consistently growing for the past 11 years and yet the keynesians seem to be woefully unaware of their coming demise.  i recall the arrogant keynesian claim that [we're all keynesians now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/we_are_all_keynesians_now) after the austrians were wiped out in the realm of mainstream economic thought, and it is true we were all keynesians because we had no choice but to use keynesian money.but now that monetary monopoly has a challenger to its global supremacy, and it is one that is immune to the massive government power to target single points of failure.  you keynesians are *finished*; you were finished in 2009, you just haven't realized it yet.  the austrians will have their revenge and the world will have a money that is free from surreptitious keynesian theft. need $50 worth of btc for paypal dollars at 85% brand new to bitcoin.  i just started buying bitcoin 2 weeks ago starting out very small to get to know and figure it out.  i've been using cash app as a wallet for buying and storage.  any suggestions on best ways for buying and storage.   i was going to use [bitcoing.org](https://bitcoing.org) for buying and bitcoin wallet but the fees on [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org) are high compared to cash app. did you try bitcoin cash? [removed] hey guys. not sure if this is the right place to post, but i've been having some trouble with cashapp bitcoin services. they locked my account &amp; i'm thinking about burning my house down and moving to belize. i like cashapp because i can easily convert my btc to cash directly on the app and use my cashapp card to withdraw it / use it as i please. however, with my account being locked, i'm stuck. i've switched to cake wallet, but it's just not as convenient as it seems i can only exchange &amp; swap there, i can't purchase / sell / cash out my btc. any tips? what setup are you guys using? something simple and all integrated like cashapp that maybe doesn't require a state id? any help appreciated. thanks! be careful everyone. i received text last evening.https://preview.redd.it/ebvyd5q4x0w51.jpg?width=2383&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78464a59b58c31ffa32525e74d2172f40add3870 am new to bitcoin and wanted to know which wallet is best blockchain/ coinbase im curious to see if im over doing it. lately ive been putting more money into btc than stocks.please create a throwaway (i did as well) because im sure you dont want to expose yourself.ill start, i have cad $6k invested.i want to put more but dont want to over do it.thanks! i recently had my bank close my checking account due to bitcoin purchases on coinbase. ive read that this is common for large purchases. is there a particular bank that is fine with large deposits to coinbase that you know of? is wire transfer from my bank a better option than a deposit? thanks hi guys,im relatively new to bitcoin and crypto in general, so i missed the big march dip and didnt invest. ouch. question: is it too late now? will we see another big dip because of the second round of corona lockdowns? i recently made a few purchases online and they were cancelled and refunded. the people i bought from has provided the id to confirm on blockchain that it truly has been sent back, but its not showing in my transactions or in my balance.also, i sent a few other payments, separate from the purchases above, and they're all stuck on zero confirmations. i think about 7 or 8 payments. i have the hd bitcoin account and inside that are 3 separate wallets, and the transactions were sent from 2 of the 3 wallets. i sent using the cheapest way, i think either 1 sat/byte or 18 sat/byte.i understand that transactions can't get lost or stolen or anything, so what exactly is happening here? how long will these transactions take to send? once these transactions go through will the refunds i'm waiting on appear in my transactions? is the reason the refunds are not showing is because of all these pending transactions stuck at zero confirmations?i've tried "bumping transaction", "rebroadcasting", and even "deleting transaction" but they dont really do anything. if i rebroadcast it just says "transaction sent". if i "delete", it just deletes it from the list but when i refresh it brings it back up.  and when i "bump transaction" it says "unable to build transaction".do i just need to keep waiting? one transaction has been at zero confirmations for 3 days now, since the 26th. this is taking unusually long. i need some help from some professionals here. thank you. i'm reading some wallet api and they have a feature where you can generate the xpub of a new key and the master xpub of the key in the same wallet.wouldn't they be the same thing, can someone tell me the difference? i've been doing a bit of trading on robin hood and bought a bit of bit coin awhile back when it was around 4k. i bought a bunch of other stocks as well to try and keep a decently diverse portfolio and just wanted to begin somewhere and try and learn what i could. i quickly learned that buying through robin hood i didn't technically own the keys and thus didn't really own any sats. ive looked at quite a few wallets and just ordered a bitbox02. i've sold almost all my stocks now and would like to sell off the bitcoin and put the money from stocks/bitcoin into keys i own but im not really sure where to go from here. i've seen quite a few "bitcoin aims" but have heard they charge high service fees. any advice would really be appreciated. hi, are there service that facilitate the payment of goods and services by bank transfer or paypal but from converting bitcoin ? thanks first of, i am gary.i have a vps hosting which has around 70 gb storage left.i wanna use like 20-30 gb for setting up community forum.it could be for beginners, discussion or scam warning.and i hope after the set up , volunteer mods will take care of it.how can i get started ?any help guys ? at $13127 on bitstamp right now, the price has only been higher than that for 40 days (at the time of the peak in dec 2017/jan 2018).the price is now higher than it's ever been since those crazy few weeks.

[removed] hi reddit! what do you think about blenderwallet?blender  wallet  a secure non-custodial wallet,  focused on anonymity. all the  benefits of bitcoin-payments available in  the web version and in the  mobile app for maximum convenience.[https://blenderwallet.io](https://blenderwallet.io/) \- can trust this application? i was curious to know if the majority of people that use dollar cost averaging set up automatic recurring purchases or do you remind yourself to purchase your crypto at the intervals that you want? if you do use recurring purchases, which exchange do you recommend and why? this seems like a strong signal for stellar considering it's 1) the primary coin for receiving maximum cashback on purchases and 2) that of all the alt-coins coinbase could have added to the card for transactions, stellar was chosen. the visa card seems like a solid way to help bridge crpto and old school financial models, so i am wondering why this hasn't had a bigger impact on news coverage.[https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/coinbase-to-launch-debit-card-in-the-us-with-rewards-program/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/coinbase-to-launch-debit-card-in-the-us-with-rewards-program/) [removed] [removed] if anyone uses coinbase as their exchange, when logging onto the mobile app, you will see an ad at the top of your home page for coinbase card and they advertise a 4% cash back. my question to the crypto community is, how does this make sense? are grocery stores and restaurants at large accepting crypto? i know some are but i dont see large scale adaptation yet. so why is coinbase going through with this project?[the article on coinbase card ](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538278/coinbase-card-visa-debit-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-stellar-lumen-spending-money) [removed] it seems many holders, especially new crypto holders who have a seed that protects their crypto need to learn to use a passphrase specifically with a hardware wallet such as a ledger or trezor. even if someone gets ahold of your entire seed, if they don't have the passphrase, they can't get ahold of your funds. when you reset a hardware wallet the pincode to get into the device is erased which is why a passphrase is extremely important. below is an article that goes into how to set up a passphrase and there is also endless youtube videos explaining the importance and how to set one up.https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005214529-advanced-passphrase-security [removed] [removed] fun thought experiment: a 20 percent vote attack could be perpetrated against the community by actor(s) holding 20 percent of moons. they would unilaterally pass a vote to give themselves all future moons or, if possible, redistribute the 80 percenters moons to themselves. this could be done if most of the community was apathetic or unaware of the vote. if the community was fully aware of the vote then it would take a 51 percent attack.once the cabal has passed the voted to get the remaining moons,  it won't be possible to pass a new vote to undo the change because they now hold the majority of moons.now that people know moons have real world value, the odds of an attack are a concern. i'd like to hear what the community thinks about this. i've been a coinbase user since mid-2017.  since then i've bought and sold quite a bit of crypto.i've done all of the coinbase earn things in the past with no problem, but now that algorand just went live for earn, i'm on the waitlist.now that might not sound too strange except that i set up coinbase accounts for my parents a few years ago, too, but they've never purchased nor sold anything and they don't even have any payment methods linked....but they were able to do the earn stuff for algorand.soooooo, is it random or...? [removed] [removed] why is it that in the top posts of 24hrs there is a large disconnect in the upvotes posts. it's usually a few posts (mostly memes) in the top from the last 24hrs at around 1k upvotes and then it goes to the low hundreds and then drops right down to the tens. do most people on the sub only browse hot or trending? or do they just see what appears in their feed. are very little in the new section? [removed] i just found a load of jsecoins that i mined a couple of years ago and wondered if they are exchangeable anywhere. i have been out of crypto for a while so am not up on which exchanges are reliable etc so could do with some pointers please. i am in the uk btw. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] almost a half year ago moon was created and pesented. it brought some innovations and changed lifes of reddit degenerate retards. now here on r/cryptocurrency we get awarded for our retardedness. the question is: can other retards on other subreddits and other social networks experience it in future? [removed] seen so much talk about the 21 million club lately. so i figured i make a poll to see who is directly or indirectly part of the 21 million club.^(disclosure: this poll is is in no way sponsored, endorsed, administered by or associated with the irs.)[view poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/jkacp0) let me explain with this simple example what i understood.let's say,1 dai = 1$ and1 eth = 1$ in50/50 poolif eth price rises by 1$ and now cost 2$, an arbitraguer might come and buy 1 eth for 1 dai and sell it elsewhere for 2 usd leaving lp with 2 dai which cost 2$ in total where as there should be 3$ in total. so, unless eth price doesn't fall back to 1$, lp can't buyback eth and suffer 50% loss.vice-versa if et price falls. it's amazing how quickly things happen in this industry.from big corporations (microstrategy and square) buying bitcoin to paypal's integration happened within the space of three months.anyone betting against bitcoin must be blind to how far we've come. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] what do you guys think about the future pf moons and other coins like it(bricks).are we gonna see more subreddits adopt it an this is the start of an entire ecosytem of reddit moons?or is that gonna be it and it will be a specialty of those few subreddits.as well well as terms of uses for the coins.i think the idea of merch was thrown out and the possibility of making reddit premium moon exclusive.possible other uses as well ? [removed] hey guys,i have an important question concerning the order of usage of coins in your wallet. i already got different answers from different trading sites, so maybe one of you can clarify: if i transfer coins from my wallet, can i determine which will be send? and i don't mean which currency (duh), but which one of my hypothetical (bit)coins will be send? the one i bought first? the last? can i choose a coin i bought last week? it's important for tax issues in germany. thank you all in advance! are  you guys selling or keeping your monero?. it's currently at $123. i'm  not going to sell anything, i'll ride out the storm and i'll buy even  more when it's cheaper.people use crypto's to make a quick buck, not as a tool for financial freedom.........

UP //POSTDATACOMPILED// when syncing a node, it shows progress and log2_work.i assume log2_work has to do with the difficulty adjustment and cumulative work done?progress has nothing to do with time, or block number. is it related to how many transactions need to be verified? does anyone know this fact? im finally sending money off in exchange to my ledger. im confirming the code everything. it shows up on my wallet and it says confirmed after 30 minutes after that is everything good? so i did two test transfers for over 1k toral. first one i forgot to hit accept on ledger to confirm code but i double checked and second one i clicked accept. money showing up in ledger but says not confirmed. now my question is i dont get the net work fees. said it was a dollar on the exchange but then under the ledger says net work fees $70 &amp;$60. did that really cost 130? would one giant transfer be better then?

(let's say the product was worth all 14k for simplicity).seems like a lot of complicated steps for an average person to wrap their head around. **prosecutors from the netherlands have seized 2,532 bitcoins worth $33 million after a couple was convicted of money laundering by the rotterdam district court. the man and his wife were sentenced to two years for illegal money transmission and the court claims the couples bitcoin stash was used on the deep web.**dutch officials recently arrested and charged a man and his wife for illegal money transmission and money laundering. according to the dutch public prosecution service from the rotterdam district court, the two suspects laundered close to $19 million using bitcoin during the last two years. most of the couples illegal earnings were stored in bitcoin and the rotterdam police confiscated the stash.the man and woman were residents of north hollands hilversum and the couple will face two and a half years in prison for their crimes. dutch prosecutors noted during the trial that the traders did not leverage proper kyc/aml guidelines while operating the business.traders did not ask customers for identity papers, while large amounts were often exchanged, the rotterdam [court filing notes](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/tech/artikel/5192533/rechter-neemt-25-miljoen-euro-aan-bitcoins-beslag-van-witwassers). the suspects, a man, and his wife, came into contact with customers through advertisements on the internet and a marketplace on the dark web. much of the bitcoins traded bore traces of the dark web. the court has established that the suspects laundered more than 16 million euros in two and a half years.https://preview.redd.it/ml6wd7zwe9w51.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8fd07967a357a1fa4dcff6a3f2982558c22091ccourt documents show that the police confiscated two different bitcoin stashes with one cache holding 1,488 [btc](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/btc) and the other wallet held 1,044 [btc](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/btc). in addition to the $33 million worth of bitcoins seized, dutch police also took $295,256 in cash reserves. court prosecutors said that the couple purchased bitcoins in order to exchange for cash. police said that the couple leveraged methods to keep their customers unknown.on a regular basis, the couple met people and businesses at fast food restaurant chains in order to execute the cash for bitcoin exchanges. prosecutors believe a great number of these coins sold by the hilversum made it to the deep web and were used on darknet marketplaces (dnm).the dutch police are well known for many bitcoin seizures and crackdowns against dnm operators. four years ago, dutch police [arrested 10 individuals](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/20/bitcoin-netherlands-arrests-cars-cash-ecstasy) from the netherlands for laundering large sums of bitcoins. the netherlands law enforcement officials are also responsible for the great [hansa takedown,](https://news.bitcoin.com/the-curious-cases-of-the-alphabay-kingpin-and-hansa-takedowns/) where undercover agents operated the dnm for over a month without customers knowing.in addition to the $33 million in bitcoins seized and the two and a half year prison sentence, the couple must also pay fines individually. the couple will pay $53,137 for one levy and $162,955 for the forfeiture operations.***what do you think about the dutch police confiscating $33 million worth of bitcoin?***from [mickaelmosse.com](https://mickaelmosse.com) ###status of the bitcoin network as of friday, october 30, 2020 at 12:00:02 est:**total bitcoins:** 18,529,864.794971**height:** 654,791**difficulty:** 19,997,335,994,446.109375######statistics for the past 24 hours:**number of blocks mined:** 120**total bitcoins output (amount sent):** 2,799,090.645826**total fees:** 278.918015**average time until block found:** 12 minutes, 0 seconds**estimated hashrate:** 119,288,755,651.270157 gh/s**current price:** us$13,591.61*data provided by [smartbit.com.au](https://www.smartbit.com.au). price data provided by [coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com).****^^i ^^am ^^a ^^bot. **[^^my ^^commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/3an2c4/ive_been_working_on_a_bot_for_crypto_subs_like/)** ^^| ^^*/r/crypto_bot* ^^| [^^message ^^my ^^creator](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=busterroni) ^^| [^^source ^^code](https://github.com/busterroni/crypto_bot) [removed] why does btc get so much love from the bitcoin community when bch is faster and cheaper for actually making transactions.seems a bit backwards to me, bch seems way more scalable. if we're serious about using bitcoin in future surely bitcoin cash is the way to go.please enlighten me. ***hi i hope everyone is doing well, anyone interested in earning a passive income of $3000 every week please contact me on 0820768071*** do you guys know any trusted website that offers could bitcoin mining? [removed] hey sorry for this noob question but i have been trying to research this on my own for a while and i still don't understand. the whole thing is public and you have to verify your identity when you buy crypto. even the bitcoin atm i've seen has a little window for you to verify your identity with a license or whatever it was asking for. so i just don't understand how this is all "private" when somewhere along the path you're going to have to identify yourself (at least from what i keep finding).i bought a ledger and was able to sign up and set the whole thing up without any identity. so i guess the only way i can see having anonymous crypto is paying someone cash to send it to me.  but that's so sketchy in itself and almost certainly will end up with a negative result.i just want to understand how is this "private" what can i "privately purchase" could i buy a full car in crypto? or a house? a playstation 5? medical marijuana? (legally).if you do explain in the comments please give me resources. for example if you say i can do this or that then tell me where and how please. and please just tell me what to look for i'm not comfortable clicking links from strangers....sorry not sorry has anyone heard of someone's savings account (celsius or blockfi) being hacked? i don't have a hard wallet because my crypto is in a savings account. dumb, smart, risky? appreciate the thoughts. i've just found newegg but they don't ship to europe i'm fairly new to bitcoin and crypto so please bear with me. i have a 'stuck' transaction which i want to cancel. i initially increased the rbf thinking it would go through but it's still taking forever. i no longer need the service i was paying for. according to the post, i can cancel this transaction by sending the same amount to another address. can i do that immediately or do i need to reduce the rbf for the transaction to remain unconfirmed and drop off the blockchain first? 6 days ago put decent money in. said coins are on hold. said on the 30th some will be available. i still cannot send any coins. if i sell any of it i cant withdrawal it to bank either. thoughts? hi all!i am a beginner looking to buy some bitcoin and have some questions. also, apologies if i dont use the right terminology, im pretty new to the crypto world. bitcoin seems to be an exciting long term investment, so i want to get in the game. i understand there are risks involved as no one knows for sure what the long term growth of bitcoin will look like. i just want to make sure i dont lose my money because i did something dumb and didnt secure the bitcoin well enough.i purchased a ledger nano s from amazon that should arrive in the next couple days. after i get that set up, which i dont know how to do yet, id like to purchase some bitcoin (or a percentage of a bitcoin haha). i plan to do more research on how they work as well over the next couple days.  once it is set up where would you recommend i purchase the bitcoin from? the cash app looks pretty easy to use but im not sure if there are better places to buy from. im open to suggestions. also, is there anything else i should know before i purchase bitcoin? i know there is a lot more information i should know, but id like to buy some as soon as possible. any feedback is appreciated, thanks! i see so many post ppls say dont use binance is not very goodwhy peoples dont like binance ?also wwhy is binance still most popular if alot ppls hait it :d ? ive been stacking sats for quite a while now, but keep wondering: are people investing today early still early to the game? is there any way to show this mathematically?

(it was a clean shutdown.)  thanks for any clarification, just trying to learn how it works under the hood. so, i am ashamed to say that i got scammed today out of around $800, now what's done is done, is there any legit way to recover my loss?

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] finally moved my crypto to a hardware wallet. feels amazing. one of the best investments of 2020.this is gonna be a bit long winded, but worth the read if you are considering investing in a cold wallet. i will provide as much info of my experience as possible to help you make a decision on if it is the right choice for your cryptocurrency.  so this is basically for newbies or people on the fence about investing in a cold/hardware wallets. fucking do it; for your peace of mind, control, accomplishment, and privacy. the benefits outweigh any laziness or fears you may have as i did.for the longest time i kept my funds and crypto between exchanges as i traded a lot and was lazy + nervous about attempting to put all my crypto on a cold wallet. i had opted for the trezor t a couple months ago and hadn't unboxed it left it on my desk. that is where it stayed collecting dust until i said fuck it...i need to do something about this, the government approved regulated sites and exchanges should not have full control of my funds or crypto at all. i should.i had originally opted to purchases the trezor t months ago; after researching options.  i believe it is  the best option in terms of innovation, user friendly function especially with the touch screen. the associated software and set up is so easy a child could do it. they also offer a new security standard called " shamir backup [https://trezor.io/shamir/](https://trezor.io/shamir/) " which adds even extra layers of security; as an example you can have 3 fragments of a seed phrase, give 2 of them away, one to a friend and one to a family member, then keep one for yourself. say that friend becomes a massive asshole and wipes his asshole with his part of the seed phrase card then burns it - you still have the option of using the 2 that are left, successfully you can have up to 16 of these things and choose your threshold. that's the rough idea of how it works.i opted for the og single recovery seed because i am a recluse, and have no friends.  anyway, the 2 seed phrase cards that come with the trezor t system help, i actually filled them both out, vacuum sealed and laminated them - hid them in places where they are safe and i feel i have no worries about losing access to them. another couple cool things about it. comes with a usb-c, it has an sd slot for potential future encryption storage (not really sure it does anything yet. it also comes with a really awesome magnetic backing addon so you can slap it on the fridge, under desk or char, on the inside of a safe, the side of a bus if you like jogging for stupid reasons.i still plan to hold a bit of currency on my exchange for trades and buying things so there is nothing wrong with both. but i can say you will feel really good about giving yourself full control of your crypto. get a trezor t hands down, even though its a bit more expensive its totally worth it compared to the ledgers and other options which have had some recent security issues and are a lot more clunky. adding a crypto-steel backup to your arsenal may be a good idea too incase of flood, fire, rust, a dog trying to eat it etc... ( i plan to do this eventually. not eat one. but buy one)i used to scoff at the adage "not your keys not your coins!" but those people are 100% correct. listen to them. there is so much risk not being in full control of your crypto. exchanges often get hacked, mismanaged, exit scammed, account locked, account hacked, government shutdowns, some people have even been banned from exchanges and lost everything.  to put things in perspective there are only a handful of really trustworthy exchanges around today. over **43 bitcoin exchanges as of 2020** have become lost in time, like tears in rain. some of these exchanges were beloved and popular. the point being; no exchange is infallible.take control of your crypto asap. there is a lot of bad shit going down and with the elections and the covid situation being worse than the beginning of the outbreak now is the time to protect yourselves, your families and things that really matter.\*drops magnetic trezor t on mic and trips off stage\* [removed] [removed] [removed] verizon's [main website](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizons-full-transparency-launches-blockchain-verification) has more information about integration of blockchain and ethereum.[we have one of the largest companies in the world - *technically one of the largest in the history of the world* - planning on using a blockchain, ethereum no less, in the use of press-releases -- communiques on daily, weekly, and monthly business proceedings.](https://decrypt.co/46745/verizon-news-press-releases-ethereum-full-transparency)&gt;today, verizon beat the crypto news industry to the punch. it announced that its implemented a blockchain-based record for its press releases.&gt;the new system, called full transparency, is a blockchain-based, press release-recording system designed to raise the bar for corporate accountability. it cryptographically bounds each press release to the blockchain, tracking and contextualizing subsequent edits.from [yahoonews:](https://news.yahoo.com/verizon-full-transparency-launches-blockchain-140000820.html):&gt;a lack of transparency has the potential to undercut corporate credibility. according to the 2020 edelman trust barometer, nearly 60% of consumers globally believe that the media they consume is contaminated with untrustworthy information. transparency in news releases is an important step that a companyparticularly a publicly traded onecan offer. full transparency's goal is to change the way corporate newsrooms provide visibility to their readers and hold themselves accountable for what they communicate to the public.in order to stay competitive, incorporating blockchain/distributed ledgers is going to be necessary in the market and business world -- and this is just *one* example from *one* company.this is the type of news executives throughout the world are going to see and make note of. it may be clich, but doesn't make it untrue -- this is *big* news and will reverberate much like the paypal announcement did in my opinion. [removed] thought i'd try something fun and hopefully maybe inform a few people on some lesser know crypto facts:&amp;#x200b;1. **bitcoin is not the first cryptocurrency.** in fact, the award goes to digicash, which was founded years before bitcoin came into existence. it was created by david chaum in 1989 and is also based on cryptographic protocols, but it wasnt popular.2. **the us federal government spending on blockchain is predicted to reach $123.5 million by 2022**. according to blockchain statistics, this is a significant increase from $10.7 million spent in 2017. the us government and other private organizations have announced imminent plans to embark on a series of blockchain implementations into various parts of the economy and work infrastructure. *(source: next gov)*3. **the us has the highest number of token sales ever (48%).** since 2017, thousands of new cryptocurrencies were created. icos (also known as token sales) were used to raise capital for each new cryptocurrency. statistics on cryptocurrency volume by country reveal that 48% of all token sales have come from the us, 12.78% from singapore, and another 10.5% from the uk.  *(source: block social)*4. **there arent enough bitcoins for every millionaire to own one.** according to a report by credit suisse, there are 46.8 million millionaires worldwide compared to only 18.5 million bitcoins in existence out of a future total of just under 21 million.those who own 1 btc are said to be part of the 21 million club, whereas those who own 21 btc are said to be part of the one in a million club.5. **the last bitcoin is predicted to be mined by approximately the year 2140**. the number of bitcoins entering circulation  drops by half roughly every four years. these events are known as halving.i tried to find some of the more obscure facts, so hopefully even you longstanding crypto fans learnt something new!

[removed] [removed] hello - i am looking to build an education marketplace with a reputation system built on blockchain and the reputation comes from the value of transactions on the blockchain. i do not have a lot of experience with blockchains, and i don't want to spend a lot of time learning it. so my question is: what are the best platforms to use for the above purposes with rest interfaces to manage transactions and reputation (ratings + reviews) - thanks! i was looking at all those posts/pools complaining at the moon distribution and trying to offer options to solve the problem.**first, the origin of the problem :** accounts only few days old are farming moons by only creating poor quality memes thus harvesting most of the upvotes.**knowing that, one can think of the first relevant option to counter that :** only account x months old/possessing x amount of karma can post memes. it's basically the same system as posting on r/cryptocurrency when you are new : you can not. you need first to gather a bit a karma/be x days old. putting such a threshold rather stringent as a first layer of protection will, in my opinion, discourage people from creating multiple accounts thus prevent them to easily access the option of posting memes.**but, that might not be enough. so, a second layer of protection might be needed.** several options have been proposed. first, having a limit of karma on memes is off the table : we are all intrinsically driven by the need of reward materialized by upvotes or karma. and putting such a limit will i) discourage honest posters while ii) forcing spammer to spam more to get the same amount of moons. additionally, penalizing a type of post is not fair. second idea mentioned : memes are absolutely not rewarded. for the same reasons as mentioned before, it's not a good idea. i also think that we all appreciate a good meme from time to time. third : rewarding less the memes. it could be a good idea but i'm afraid that it will also force spammers to spam more to get the same amount of moons that they were getting before. so what can we do? here are the more relevant ideas that i came up with :**1)** memes are still rewarded the same but people will have to pay (in moons) to post such a content. having to pay to post a meme will greatly reduce the spamming while increasing the quality of the memes.**2)** memes are allowed everyday but only rewarded a particular day (meme day). this idea should also greatly reduce the spamming. and people who don't like memes will simply not open reddit that particular day.**3)** a limit of memes that a person can post every month. if someone makes it to hot with a meme (50 upvotes or more ; let's put a stringent cut off), then the option of posting memes becomes unavailable for the rest of the month. we all have once chance to make it to hot/best with a meme. then it will be in the hands of the community to decide which one should make it to best. on the other hand, it might enhance the multi-accounts problem but i believe that reddit as security measures to prevent that.i realize that some of these ideas might be impossible to implement, but if this post allows to start discussions leading to the solution, i will be more than happy. [removed] [removed] [removed] tl:dr: my dai is gone after trying to enter a bet into augur and i cant find my position listed anywhere. etherscan shows the transaction but nothing comes up in the augur dapp - no record whatsoever.what happened:i attempted to initiate a position in an augur market by selling short a position. the transaction was confirmed and then i signed it. under the open positions tab, my position was listed as pending. next, i tapped around the app some more and even started to initiate another position but decided not to when i saw the fee and declined the transaction with my wallet interface. after that, when i went to check my other position, it was no longer listed in the open positions tab. it wasnt listed anywhere in my account logs either - no hint of it in the augur app ui. etherscan shows the transaction though.is my dai unrecoverable? [removed] recently there seemed to be a decrease in the amount of really high quality posts. there are often really great posts but most of the time they don't get the visibility or enough upvotes and end up dying in new. i feel like this really demotivates people from creating high quality posts that take alot of time and end up just making memes or posting news. my proposal is that there is a sort of weekly competition where the highest quality post is submitted in a discussion and the top voted one is rewarded with some moons. what do you all think? https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2020/10/the-distributed-ledgermostly boring law stuff here but i'll try to sum up the best parts if you don't want to take the 20 minutes to read through everything:- doj issues first-ever cryptocurrency enforcement framework - the us department of justice is making comprehensive framework specifically to tackle crypto crime across the world - which means they have a taskforce and resources specifically dedicated to cryptocurrency.- doj brought the smackdown on bitmex - coupled with above, we all remember how this went.- fincen fined a couple of mixer operators - coin ninja and helix - they're also hitting up larry for money laundering charges.- sec was involved with bringing up enforcement action against mcafee - which ties into his arrest over tax evasion.- unikrn's gambling token is toast thanks to the sec - https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/unikoin-gold/  if any of you somehow have this, please get rid of this.- [salt tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/salt/) are now a security.- [the occ](https://www.theocc.com/) is supporting banks who want to create stablecoins and tie them legally to their assets.- the uk is heavily tightening down on crypto assets and their sale, as brexit continues to happen and consolidation of their financial system moves to more of a british-only focus.some interesting stuff in here if you like to read about fincen and what regulators are trying to do with crypto. [removed] this might sound like a stupid idea, but wouldn't it be kind of cool if we could make the moon distribution happen on the full moon of every lunar cycle? it would be something quite unique in crypto, and perhaps adds a fun, quirky aspect to the moon brand.also, people wouldn't need to keep asking, *'when is the next distribution?'* because they can just either look up online when the next full moon will be, or look up at the sky at night and see for themselves when the full moon- and the moon distribution- is due.we could even take it further and make things like the quizzes coincide with the phases of the moon, so there could be a moon giveaway on every half moon for example.what do you guys think: interesting idea, or lunacy? (sorry, i can't help myself sometimes) excluding the top 4 addresses (reddit, mods, sold moons) we have ~ 6 million moons in the top 100 holders, ~7 million in the top 170. the most weve ever had participate is ~ 4.7 million moons for the [community governance proposal.](https://np.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/comments/jig33s/community_governance_poll_only_allow_media_posts/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) there are currently over 650 votes cast for the poll (also a ath).the whales are able to avoid any changes to distribution by abstaining, which means the quorum is too high. its supposed to be high enough to deter spam like gib me all moonz but low enough that you have to vote on legitimate proposals or risk losing your say when it reaches quorum. the mods have stickied the polls, reminded everybody repeatedly and  still we cant get enough moons to vote.i dont think reddits 12.5 million moons should be included in the total, given that they dont vote. the percentage should be of **active, vote-capable moons** not total supply. this would put current 20% quorum around 3.7-4.7 million moons depending on if we include the sold moons address or not [removed] [removed] [removed] it is in dutch, but i felt it was a much needed addition, here in the nether there are a lot of people interested in cryptocurrencies. they however associate it with criminals and scams, we have been targeted by commercials whom tell they can get rich quick. most people have lost a lot of money since 2017 and it has fully died off all of the hype.my review is missing the part about explaining how coinbase works, with buying and selling. because i actually dont have any funds as of right now.i would like you guys to check it out, by the way ignore the rest of the site it isnt finished.if you guys have any suggestions feel free to tell me i want everyone to trade cryptos without any problems.https://mansotti.com/vergelijk-cryptocurrecy-exchanges-en-bekijk-onze-reviews/coinbase-review-ervaringen-vergelijking-en-beoordelingen/ [removed] &amp;#x200b;|coin|peak date|peak price|current price|$1000 invested at peak price in today's price would be worth (rounded)||:-|:-|:-|:-|:-||meme|9/22/20|$1962.98|$136.27|$69||cream|9/9/20| $289.47  |$38.30|$232||eth|8/31/20|$488.95|$379.9|$776||etc|8/1/20|$8.30|$5.33|$643||omg|8/20/20|$10.0|$2.79|$279||sushi|8/28/20| $168.91 |$0.601|$4||pickle|9/12/20| $85.24 | $18.36 |$216||yfi|9/12/20|$43678|$10536|$241||yfii|9/1/20|$9251.70| $1212.16 |$131||zrx|8/20/20|$0.970|$0.3209|$330||uni|9/18/20|$8.40|$2.256|$268||xtz|8/12/20|$4.49|$1.859|$415||link|8/15/20|$20.0|$10.949|$547||xlm|8/16/20|$0.1197|$0.0758|$634||oxt|8/15/20|$1.0|$0.2061|$206||eos|8/15/20|$3.949|$2.522|$639||bch|8/1/20|$338.49|$258.51|$765||ltc|8/16/20|$67.30|$53.73|$799||xrp|8/1/20|$0.3281|$0.2115|$645| cryptocurrencies are dropping in price because we have the u.s election coming up in just 4 days. now's the time to buy cryptocurrencies while they are cheap.once the u.s election is over, prices will spike up.**good luck everyone** [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] 2 years ago, put in 50$ in btc, now it has doubled. don't really have much interest in crypto currencies, so i want to transfer that to my paypal account. is there a way to exchange that money to paypal via the site, or do i need to go look for a buyer? hi! im looking for a talented artist to create art for a nft collection. i prefer someone knowledgable in crypto puns/jokes. dm your portfolios and ill contact you back.on top of that we are planning also to start a game so we will need a good artist. long term commitment.its a paid gig, of course.&amp;#x200b;looking forward to your submissions.

[removed] looking for some extra info.i'm a tech noob and curious about btc.i was listening to a podcast the other day and onenof the guys (a self-proclaimed ethereum maximalist) was referencing two times where bitcoin was hacked around 2013 or so. one time it required a fork to overcome someone changing the supply and another one i can't quite recall but a guy managed to steal a few or something.can someone please help me understand this part of the btc history a bit better. also, what's the reassurance that these type of problems won't occur again?thanks looking to buy a pre-built botcoin rig [removed] looking to buy my first rig and i would rather go pre-built custom or need major help in how to build one. good evening community.i've been recently studying blockchain technology (using example ofbitcoin) and i will appreciate if you have some time to clarify myunderstanding regarding three things:1) if i got it right no one could possibly have a bitcoin (in generalunderstanding), it's more about possession of some piece / stake ofthe whole value. and the only thing you could do with this stake is totransfer your ownership to another person for something in return(let's just say "pay for some good or service")2) these pieces (which i've mentioned above) could be from differentparts of the whole value. like a couple of pieces of a cake which weretaken from different quarters, but in my wallet i see a whole amount(let's say 3.25). when i would like to pay some goods or servicesusing bitcoin (let's say which cost me 1.5 bitcoin) payment mechanismwill seek such number of pieces which value will be equal or excess1.5 bitcoin, in case if number of pieces will be greater than 1.5 thenpayment mechanism will return change to my possession aftertransaction is complete (let's say i have 5 pieces which overall valueis 1.7 then they will be transferred to receiver of payment in fullbut during this transaction 0.2 value will be returned to my wallet /possession)3) in your white paper you had stated that "we consider the scenarioof an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than thehonest chain. even if this is accomplished, it does not throw thesystem open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thinair or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. nodes arenot going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honestnodes will never accept a block containing them. an attacker can onlytry to change one of his own transactions to take back money herecently spent.".could theoretically "creating value out of thin air or taking moneythat never belonged to the attacker" be possible in case if anattacker did create a mirrored chain of blocks at the same time anddate as original bitcoin was introduced with his own version of alltransactions? in other words alternate chain and honest chain have thesame starting point consequently giving to the attacker a chance toreplace the whole honest chain with creating value out of thin air ortaking money that never belonged to the attacker?thanks a lot! uk announced today. regions in canada. many eu countries....how can anyone be bullish? like where is the money going to come from? so i have been saving my money and considering what to do with it. i debated paying off some managable debt or to just keep saving for a rainy day. this morning i woke up and had an urge to buy bitcoin. i havent been keeping up on price but did a quick check to see it at nearly an all time high. i didn't hesitate and bought some right away. reading through the sub now i see there is a lot of fomo and it makes me more excited. i like to buy bitcoin with the intention of it being a retirement fund. with that mindset i dont mind if it crashes. and i dont kind when i buy it. bitcoin will inevitably go up within a year, 5 years, ect. if the plan is to hodl (and it should be imo) then dont worry about when you buy, there is no better time than right now. etf, defi, exchanges, fork, china "ban", high fees, etc [removed] i know that many people dislike liberal organisations like the adl, but i really think that we should form such an organisation, speak up against discrimination, and use legal tools to fight it.facebook's ban of the #bitcoin hashtag, while allowing actual financial scams to run wildly on their platform, is an ugly defamation. bitcoin is an ideology, a system of trust and faith, a community that is being persecuted for its beliefs. yes, some bitcoiners are criminals, but this should not stain other bitcoiners: freedom fighters and legit investors that were betrayed by the big financial corporates, and decided to take personal responsibility on their own savings.if we don't act now, it will only get worse. if we don't shout out that we're innocent, the general public will start believing the lies that are told about the bitcoin community.i hope that there are some good lawyers in this channel. let's unite and sue facebook! i just got this text message.ledger{my name here}ledger firmware has a critical vulnerability. visit ledger.deals and update it immediately. do not risk losing assets.so while i doubt theres a critical vulnerability, legder definitely got their contact list stolen. they should probably address this...be safe and question everything. how can i make extra money with bitcoin. legallyno scammers!!! what percent of normal people have at least one btc? when i say normal people i mean not corporations. thoughts hello everyone i'm brand new into the crypto scene and i've done some research but have some questions that i didn't really understand also i have purchased a ledger hardware wallet...idk1. what is bitcoin? lol jk, but can i use the same address? for example if i generate an address to receive bitcoin can i save that address and pass it out anytime someone wants to send me bitcoin? or do i have to always create a new address, which if that's the case how long are the addresses valid for?2. i came across this "incognito crypto wallet" that makes buying and sending bitcoin entirely anonymous and that you can buy a node from them and earn crypto by just having it run? is this something that is legit? if not is there any sort of similar thing that exists? and no i don't mean mining (because they said it's similar it just doesn't take so much energy)3. how can i safely and properly purchase bitcoin anonymously? i would like to have the option of using a hardware wallet or something as a "savings account" and i'd like to be able to have it entirely hidden meaning there's no trail that it belongs to me for example coinbase makes me verify my identity to purchase crypto and so do other places.4. and finally the last question i keep having trouble finding legit answers to is, how do i turn crypto into real world non magic internet money? i thought i could on coinbase but i guess not unless i keep missing the spot on how lolsorry if any of these questions are stupid or anything i'm just trying to understand and these were just some questions i was confused aboutif you do answer any of the questions just tell me which number you're answering please so i don't misunderstand as an refund address i created one on [https://coinb.in/](https://coinb.in/)  i used it for a refund and am not quite sure how to access them i still have the address and public and private key all the info i was given it is becoming clear that btc dominance will keep climbing. 63.7% as of now. there is only one game in town. long live the king.

after all 25 million are issued there will be no more financial incentive to validate transactions/mine. hi all. apologies as this is not strictly about bitcoin itself. as btc enthusiasts, we're trying to accelerate the shift from fiat to btc by offering a high-end service with btc as the only payment method accepted.i (american) have a good friend who is brazilian and lives in rio de janeiro. he teaches portuguese to foreigners and has also been working in tourism for the past ten years.we're putting together an (almost) all-inclusive experience for first-time visitors to the city. here is a brief description of the trip:\* monday, january 18, 2021 through sunday, january 24, 2021.\* 7 days, 6 nights in a high-end apartment in copacabana beach. each person will have their own private suite.\* breakfast included each day, cooked in-house. lunch and dinner at local restaurants, also included.\* excursions with english-speaking guide to see all the major sites, including corcovado, sugar loaf, and the famous beaches. all entrance fees included.\* transportation provided with private van and driver.\* two portuguese lessons via skype prior to arrival and daily one-hour portuguese lessons in person during the stay.\* additional classes to learn more about brazilian culture, music, food, etc.here is an interesting bit. my friend has a ton of female brazilian friends who are always asking to be introduced to his "rich" foreigner friends for socializing, practicing their english, and maybe more. he is happy to make introductions. ;)this is a new service and we would like to find three or four adventurous souls to try out the experience and give us feedback on how we can refine the service for future full-price clients. for this first group, we're asking **0.32 btc** from each person, which should allow us to pay for all our out-of-pocket costs. not included in the package is airfare to and from rio (we hope to include that in the future) as well as  drinks and any incidental purchases.note: brazil took the worst of the pandemic but the numbers have been stable or declining for awhile, especially in the rio area.  the city is open for flights and everything is returning to normal. citizens of most countries, including the usa, canada, and most of western europe do not need a visa in advance to visit brazil.that's the spiel. if this interests you, please send me a dm for more details. if all sounds good, we can set up a time to talk via skype. just wondering if this is a "bitcoiner" trait or any likeminded people out there. i've always been a saver, and ever since becoming involved in bitcoin for a few years back, i've been appealed to the self-sovereign, store of value, philosophy. i've always just put my leftovers of my paycheck in bitcoin. every time i contemplate spending money for something i don't really need (outside of food, rent, transport etc.) i've always asked myself, "do i really need xyz, or can i put that extra money toward bitcoin?"basically every month, 3 things happen on payday: 1. i pay off my monthly credit card in full (since all my expenses are on a cc), 2. i pay my monthly rent (since it cannot be paid on credit), and 3. i put all the leftovers in a savings account and/or in bitcoin. then i repeat this every month at payday. i have 2 numbers to review each month, how much i spent on my cc, and how much i saved/put in bitcoin as leftovers.i've been doing this since 2017, since the last bullrun, and i've had no desires to ever sell since then. i don't care about trading, i want to be self-sovereign, without relying on government policy/spending, i don't want to see my money rot away in a savings account as i hold my wealth for the many years to come. according to coin desk! [removed] come on ! [removed] hodl brothers and sisters 2021 will be the greatest year of out lifetimes god bless hi, i wonder if there's a decentralized exchange that supports btc/eth and requires no registration and let's you trade by just connecting your wallet (instead of having to deposit your crypto on the exchange). [removed] when someone cant repay a loan or is in terrible debt and they reply with bitcoin fixes this what do they mean? is this a scam? i presume they mean invest in bitcoin and youll be a millionaire? if we close today above $13,880.00 then it will be the biggest monthly close in bitcoin history!!let's go!! a bitcoin wallet i just downloaded from ios (if you look it up in the appstore its titled bitcoin wallet - buy btc published by polehin ltd, asked me to take a picture of myself with the debit card i used to buy bitcoin. it asked for to include the first 6 and last 4 digits of the card in the picture and to cover everything else. the coin was purchased through a third party called moonbase, im pretty sure it was them who sent me the email. is this legit? should i send the picture? how does the world deal with individuals that have the private keys for 1000s of coin?  lets assume satoshi shows back up, could he buy his own army?this is value in a form never seen before. gold took centuries for it to be widely adopted as a store of value. entities who owned a lot of gold had to have acquired it through hard labor and distributing wealth along the way to workers/equipment vendors/etc.billy the neck beard could have mined it in 2008 and is sitting on a fortune. how does this effect the world economy? anything interesting that can happen because of this? will governments require billy to hand some over? i buy bitcoin @ a very nice rate,i can be your direct vendor.i can drop my whatsapp for trades.i am looking for more suppliers and paying $10k monthly.if you supply daily i use bitcoin core. processing the blocks is painful if you haven't opened your wallet for a few months. is there any way to ease the pain? i know there are lots of flags but never used any. read some other threads about changing the cache. i'm currently using a 500mb read/write ssd. will upgrading to a 5000mb pcie 4.0 drive help? i'm guessing it won't use all that but i know there are more to these things than read/write speeds.i've been noticing alot of dust attacks in my wallet. it makes me nervous. i hear i can freeze or isolate those deposits. how do i do that? i've been considering a hardware wallet. my wallet is basically in cold storage and only goes online for a few minutes a few times a year. is a hardware wallet worth if for my usage? do they require being connected to a phone app for any reason? i really don't want anything financial on my phone. how do we know these things are secure anyways? is there any way a rogue employee, like the guys writing the code and putting in on the device, can sneak in a back door or make a copy of the private keys or recovery phrase? they do seem interesting and bitcoin is such a pain but i tend to trust it more than third parties. [removed] please utilize this sticky thread for all general **bitcoin** discussions! if you see posts on the front page or /r/bitcoin/new which are better suited for this daily discussion thread, please help out by directing the op to this thread instead. thank you!if you don't get an answer to your question, you can try phrasing it differently or commenting again tomorrow.[join us in the r/bitcoin chatroom!](https://s.reddit.com/channel/872992_7f67f22e296c2f65bd39f5af98f30a96b5e3e21e)please check the [previous discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/jks1vg/daily_discussion_october_30_2020/) for unanswered questions. many people are out of jobs and many of them are also the interest rates being down the prices have gone up especially bubbles like california! im not sure about this but theres going to be a student debt crisis too does anyone with btc expertise know why a transaction is taking almost 24 hours to confirm? any takers? don't get too excited about central banks issuing their own cryptocurrencies. there are some obvious reasons why banks and nations want to have state-backed cryptocurrencies, and it's not "financial inclusion".for one, central bank coins won't be coins like bitcoin, nor tokens like on ethereum. they'll be contracts. so, for example, you own 1 digital euro-coin, but it's really a contract for 1 digi-euro. meaning, the issuer of the contract (the central bank) can stipulate that you must pay an arbitrary amount of interest on your contract. the issuer can withdraw this interest from your wallet without you being able to do anything about it. i mean to say that such central bank coins automatically lose a % per year by sending it back to the central issuer.this, to me, is a terrifying dystopian outlook. sure, banks won't be able to do this with bitcoin. bitcoin is solid. but coin-contracts, where a coin is a contract, open up a whole new world of state crimes against the people. your funds can be seized or frozen with great ease.such a bank-coin obviously has to run on some kind of platform, and currently, the sort of platforms that may support his type of contract-with-interest-coin schemes are for example ripple or ethereum. i suspect ripple may be the platform of choice for banks and governments.secondly, once all people's savings have been moved to such a digital coin platform, nations and banks can stop issuing paper/physical currency. we shall have the cashless society. and you know what will happen next? you must obey, you must work for your slavery, you must echo the right opinions, or you will be excluded from the financial system.this has already happened to some far-right extremists like laura towler, martin sellner etc. they lost all of their bank accounts + funds without notice. see 'how corporations can delete your existence'[https://unherd.com/2020/10/how-corporations-can-delete-your-existence/](https://unherd.com/2020/10/how-corporations-can-delete-your-existence/)one more reason why bitcoin-like crypto is so important. i hope the more subversive elements in this community will continue building an alternative financial system, so that we may all transact with one another off-the-grid. what is defi? and how i can check the authenticity of it's bounty programs? took me a full year of saving and a few stressful trades but i made it to my goal. not much but it's a start!remember - not your keys, not your coins.stay well everyone!what are your crypto goals? i wanted to ask your opinion on stacking on defi, for example nexo, so that you can earn interest on your btc. i am hodling, so might as well get some interest on it?what are you precautions on stacking? how to choose a good company and what to look out for?cheers! hello all!since bitcoin is not legal in my country, i use p2p websites to buy and sell bitcoin. today, i met a guy who wants to buy bitcoin for amazon gift card. i've never bought or used any gift cards especially amazon because afaik it is not supported in my country.so, i am afraid that there can be scams or so. please give me some insights, precautions or anything that i should consider while dealing with him. or should i deal him or not?also, if its safe, please i would like to know how will i use that gift card to withdraw it to cash.sorry for noob question. and thanks for the answer in advance!

(...i mean, that is what we all believe, yeah?)...without understanding them at least even a little bit, though, i feel like that level of adoption is going to take so much longer than i had initially. [removed] test triggered by a recent post in which it was pointed out that a block hadn't been mined for 1.5 hours..there was 1 hour and 41 minutes between blocks. 1 hour and 41 minutes!https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/000000000000000000025e38a9f31ba9298786ffb0279e4bde382bdee00c4d88https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/00000000000000000007b0562e9a1e8e508338fe8874ffa8586c61afddcce4d8i was wondering how people, mostly bitcoin enthusiasts, think about this. so apparently, even if you pay the maximum transaction fee to get into the next block, it could still be the case that you have to wait for over an hour to get a single confirmation. i see this as a bit of an issue, apparently regardless of the fee you pay, you can't count on bitcoin for any time-sensitive transaction.how do you feel about this? do you think that this is okay because it's a store of value that doesn't need to be moved, or do you see issues with this because apparently even block times can't be relied upon? [removed] [removed] i think a lot of people would agree with me that social media, and more specifically the monetization of it, is a real problem. with the recent release of the social dilemma these issues are being brought forward to those outside of the web marketing and analytical sectors.what i'd like to hear is thoughts about creating these networks with the ability to protect user data and also look into solving the issue of keeping speech free while preventing the coerced directing the users have now.my immediate thought is a non-fungible token that could be activated on any portal that the user proved ownership to, possibly signing a transaction to keep private keys private. while this would mean activity would be public on the blockchain, private functions could be carried out on the portal side.with this setup i believe the users could join different portals based on content, but still share content across differing sites based on their token links. so as an example, i'm a member of sites a and c, and my friend is on site a and b, i could share information i found on site c with them on site a and it would allow for their interaction without forcing them to join a site they may not be otherwise interested in.this idea of mine is rough and possibly already out there but i'd still love to hear some feedback. [removed] just wanted to share some of the stats that only mods have access to and combine them with some publicly available data to give an idea of subreddit traffic and growth since moons were introduced.below is the number of unique visitors on a monthly basis:https://preview.redd.it/x60m7kmiugw51.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8f8ee27ff3927c4d4729c2cd0dc8eb9ea418af9we actually seem to have a slight downtick in unique visitors since last month, and we're down quite a bit from the yearly high in august. however, the actual number of pageviews is up quite significantly since last month, but still down a bit from august:https://preview.redd.it/yat634prugw51.png?width=659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d0dccea9f44c41aac9acdba8d9873eaf02f3a2these visitor stats are a little bit at odds with the number of comments per day:https://preview.redd.it/4l7evhc6vgw51.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ae42f732c3b3da5306e6ee94b6c4b1953613365and the number of posts per day:https://preview.redd.it/9mnqids9vgw51.png?width=1113&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55d04f0d36bfab4b377315a56dd608977e6efd92both the comments per day and posts per day were taken from [subredditstats.com](https://subredditstats.com) and i think are indicative of the "moon farming" effect that has kind of taken hold of the sub since july or august.happy halloween when was the last time this happened? i know the time between blocks was more varied in the early days, but it's more consistent for years, hasn't it?also, is there somewhere that shows the distribution of block times? i'd be interested to see just how out of the ordinary this is. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] this isn't new per say but usaa has allowed us to connect our coinbase wallets. it would show the dollar amount in these wallets. the feature i think disappeared, not sure, but then came back recently this year. but i noticed something really strange.so they include the amount of x crypto you have, the dollar amount it is worth, and then it includes "bits." what the hell are bits!? also i have about $1200 worth of xlm and link on my coinbase account.  but on usaa the amount of bits i have for link is soo much less i have in xlm? what is this?does anyone know what these bits are? why do i have more bits in xlm than link when they are the same dollar amount? any other banks have something similar? i included an image.  i wonder if bits will be some kind of standard measurement? is 1 bit 1 satoshi maybe?

[removed] [removed] [removed] after years of broken promises, inability to deliver as well as decline in market cap and community, stratis - a former, wannabe competitor to ethereum - has pushed the community to agree to an unfavorable token swap, basically diluting the token value by &gt;25% through higher annual inflation and increasing token balance (to be credited to the dev team).not only did they urge the token holders by leaving no choice, either you agree or we will abandon the project (due to funds), but also purposefully did not release already developed features - only to be available post-swap.while this is already abysmal, the team continues to scam the remaining community and token holders through a rushed and uncoordinated token swap to be completed within less than a month (until mid november) and without enough advance notice and only scarce information during the token swap:- no exchanges announced to support the token swap- manual swap procedure failed for several holders- no clarity where the token will be traded afterwardsin addition, several of the few remaining bigger exchanges supporting stratis - like poloniex - are already delisting the token.so, we got a value dilution through an immediate and hidden dev tax, intransparent and unhonest token swap and loss of the few exchanges to sell the crap!

[removed] they have my vote. if everything was reset and all cryptocurrencies were started at the same time, which one(s) do you think would prevail? i think this is far more serious than we think. people who are serious with their holdings have bought ledgers and with the ledger database compromised a key set of identifying information is out there. the bigger issue is home address for a lot of us opening up the possibility of a home invasion when bitcoin reaches critical mass around $1m or so in next 10-15 years.give it a good hard thought and make your move. in my opinion, i would have moved twice or so by then, so it may not be as easy but for some people it's a real problem.what do you guys think? hey guys,bitcoin's 12th birthday / halloween just passed. with that, i hope to show tribute to the king of cryptocurrency. **we all can relate to our childhood superheroes. and i think bitcoin deserves one (or more) too.** i think a visual representation of bitcoin's characteristics and history would be fun to bring to life. so with that i would like to create the **bitcoin superhero project**. i will be posting images of our superhero here as we go.1. if you have any character concept ideas or suggestions please do share it!2. if you have your own art, showcase it too :)3. we can vote on our favorite designs :)thanks guys!\-one blue landlet me start off with the first bitcoin character concept. let me know what you think!https://preview.redd.it/4o0gh0zsqpw51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78e4c5449cb31dbfaefa6e1dc9543fa45084a701 firstly, i'll say i belive bitcoin is going to the moon and it's not a matter of if but when. in just looking for general thoughts on what these uncertain economic times could mean for bitcoin. it seems like most of the world is going to see the effects of a major economic downfall in the near future, as soon as the effects of covid really take their toll. do you think they will print more stimulus money to keep evening afloat for a little while longer? (i know i'm not the only one who would immediately trade another stimulus for bitcoin, which would be great for bitcoin). do you think that bitcoin will detach from the economy at a staggering rate at some point and could be triggered by a near economic collapse? or do you think bitcoin will likely continue to slowly rise and take at least 20 years to reach its full potential regardless of the economy? or is it possible that if the economy were to go down that bitcoin would go down with it?

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i recently got into a spat with a fella on r/personalfinance claiming that crypto is gambling. that he works in pe and says that crypto will be banned and is not worth the investment, that it's made for criminals only, the fed and other financial institutes will crackdown on it etc.i'm 9000% sure he is wrong. can you guys tell me why? i have my own ideas but i'd like to get more from you fellas. i have been using binance for several months and liked the options like the plethora of different crypto, the customer support and some of the features it offered, along with low-ish fees. it was good times, at least for a while.lately though, i have been really sus and put off by the amount of shilling and "innovation" coins that they add which get pumped out of the gates then crash. flm, cream, cake  etc. while having an innovation option for start up crypto is a great idea it seems they are using this as their own personal mass crypto creation platform to pump and collude with the creators of these coins. this innovation service would be better used for smaller, ethical and innovative teams that need a hand getting off the ground who have no ties or connection to anyone within the binance company.it seems to me like a big money grab on their part, if not predatory. even the staking and saving options used to be kind of cool, but now just seems to promote their own revolving door of random shit coins that don't really add much in terms of innovation nor provide value to the cryptocurrency community as a whole.everyday i check their market i see these random coins i have never heard of, up 20-40%, but looking at the charts it just seems manipulated. i am not saying that is what they are doing, but i really cant think of another reason as to why this would happen with some random coin named "ballsac".binance has added probably a dozen new coins in the last few months that really dont offer much other than inflated hype. even if you decide to stake your bnb, or usd backed stable coins for these things there is very little value or return worth the trouble. ooooooo i made 20 cents staking flm for a month. obligatory " wow! such coins! much monies!" while i am not complaining about free money, is it really worth my time and effort to waste my time on this shit? it is actually a huge shame because i initially though flm had some interesting attributes and potential and with that defi bubble that sort of popped recently it didn't help any of the defi based coins. especially since defi is still in its infancy.the point of all of this is to get some feedback and discussion on what everyone here thinks of binance, it's value as an exchange to crypto and its future. bnb token still seems to be a solid investment just because the exchange has been doing well for itself and does offer a lot of changeability and trading options within. but i have lost faith in taking the exchange seriously as i once did. im all about privacy and security online and that includes secure id data storage. ive been exploring this area a little out of curiosity. i see id as being an adoptable form of the technology. i have been focusing on dgb for digi-id and i also got back into ont having learned more about their id and data platform. onto wallet is a great product and i can see big potential with their deid. i know neo is also working on something for id but are also integrating ontology network for their solutions. icon(icx) has made some pretty big announcements for their id technology in south korea but at this point i havent done much research into icx yet. its on my todo list.what other projects are out there that i have missed? i actually havent looked into any projects on ethereum mostly because i dont think the network fees can justify usage of id currently. but i also dont understand technicals well enough to know what impact gas fees would have.

[removed] this yet another crypto censorship bullshit from facebook is a great reminder for all of us, crypto enthusiasts - **let's practice what we preach.** now, when both the technicals and fundamentals are finally here, and the market is starting to bloom once again, is the perfect time to turn back to crypto values and actual decentralized products.[status messenger](https://status.im/) and [bat browser](https://brave.com/download/) are two flagman examples of how crypto tech is superior to the centralised evil corp shit from google and facebook, and can be popular too! i myself use those daily and have already several people hooked on them too. call me naive, but imo we should all relocate some of this trading/chart watching/shitposting time to actually using crypto or at least do it with  decentralized tools lol.**as our response to the recent censorship of btc by facebook, i also invite everyone to boycott facebook and invite at least few of your friends (with whom you chat the most, naturally) to switch to the status app**, **and start using bat instead of chrome, safari or other browsers.** also what are other cool crypto apps you are using and would recommend? let's make it happen guys, because who else if not us? dualism is a force of nature. if bitcoin is yin, altcoins are yang. the problem for altcoins is that the market hasn't picked one to be yang, they pick all of them all at once. altcoins are suffering from being too plentiful...an ever increasing amount of altcoins are ever inflating are fighting for the same slice of the pie of altcoin pie. they are all weighing each other down.*ethereum*, the largest altcoin, has many problems. you have to remember why billionaires and millionaires are buying bitcoin and giving bitcoin a high valuation in the first place: wealth preservation and usd/fiat hedge. they aren't buying it to get rich, because well, they are already rich in the first place. in contrast, the entire appeal of ethereum is going from rags to riches in the altcoin casino, and casinos only appeal to people who aren't rich. not to mention ethereum isn't a technical currency, doesn't have a supply cap and is far more centralized so it doesn't act as a fundamental hedge against fiat. you have to remember eth is a platform where users are more attached to the content hosted on the service rather than the service itself, and risks becoming "myspaced" if another service becomes more attractive. eth will risk getting left behind if it doesn't update itself in 3.0, 4.0, 10.0, 100.0, etc... but also risks becoming too centralized if it changes too much.*defi* has even more problems. most of them are inflationary by design and most investors are oblivious to the actual monetary policies within the coins. defi operates in a legal grey area among most of the world, and if they aren't already illegal in many countries already under existing law, they will be illegal soon in most of the world for facilitating unlicensed/unregistered borrowing and lending, and money laundering. there is a reason why these services require things like kyc in real life, because smart contracts aren't an actual legal contract. if software were passable as contracts, you would not be required to sign a terms of service contract on every website you browse.&amp;#x200b;*stablecoins* look to be taking over the altcoin market silently, and usdt is on pace to overtake ethereum next year. stablecoins have the biggest potential to become bitcoin's yang, but it will probably be in the form of an official stable coin released by the us federal reserve. i think usd vs gold will turn into digital usd vs digital gold.

hello, hello! is there anyone who can help with any ongoing questions i may have regarding crypto and going into crypto art? for example- can i connect my metamask and coinbase? am i even supposed to have both at the same tome? i was kicked off of cash app because i sent bitcoins outside the united states.  my question is how did cash app know where my bitcoin was going if all they had was my bitcoin wallet address that was indeed located outside the usa? not that i read the user agreement but nobody does. i honestly didnt realize that was a rule for cash app especially for the first global defi cryptocurrency. for some strange reason i was thinking universal payment meant bigger than inside the united states. youd think i wouldve received at least an email or text or something notifying me that i was not following their user agreement before they just shut my account down. or perhaps there could be a disclaimer that you have to check before withdrawing out the crypto to an external  address located outside of the united states. i mean technically the bitcoin comes from the blockchain that located in computers all over the world , right?  im not extremely familiar with crypto so i may not make complete sense so feel free to go into more detail or correct whatever i said that was incorrect. anyway just letting others know about this no tolerance policy. if you made the same mistake i did good look getting in touch with costumer support. fees to buy coins..now mycelium is charging 9 freakin dollars just for normal speed. and endless stuff can go wrong..and if you're not a computer wizard, trying to figure out how to fix some of the problems that come up seem impossible. did they literally try to make this shit as difficult as possible?sorry for the rant lol [removed] i have a couple old android phones kicking around. they're in pristine condition and i have no use for them. i'd like to experiment with holding small amounts of bitcoin on a mobile cold storage wallet.i understand a primary security flaw of using a mobile device as a cold storage wallet is if it can connect to the internet, it can be hacked. i have long since removed the sim cards from my devices and i'm considering physically extracting the antennae signal cables inside the phone so that it is incapable of connecting to the internet.i'm familiar with the inner working of the phone, having replaced its screen, battery, charging port, sim card tray (i really like these phone), so removing the antennae cables is trivial.would extraction of these cables eliminate the typical security concern for mobile cold wallets?

[removed] [removed] as the market enters another bitcoin era, today we look at how $btc is doing during times of the pandemic. from year to date, bitcoin has outperformed traditional assets. is this surprising or not?let's say you bought $100 of bitcoin on 01/01/20. it would have grown to $190 on 10/28/20.  if you placed your $100 in the nasdaq 100 or the dollar index, your balance would be $133 and $96, respectively.[see how $btc compares to assets like commodities and equities](https://preview.redd.it/ssvvwwvzqww51.png?width=1658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d7e39ec6c2a74fe014b9de3e03e5485c3e5177)the orange line indicates btc performance, which dropped to heart-palpitating lows when covid19 spread in the us, but reached a new record for 2020, at the end of october&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/rw6alut4rww51.png?width=2056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=405123ec40677fa7865be925b31b075519ff99e7at the start of 2020, btc strongly correlated with commodities, but broke away in october  potentially from a risk-aversion to traditional markets due to a surge in covid cases and political environments.https://preview.redd.it/i4yumb67rww51.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72fef7d90d931a49ce8fdf8315890f93738c57cbalso, bitcoin showed significant correlation with the equity markets in q1, mostly because all markets sold off in a flight to liquidity. however, once financial stimulus packages were announced, asset prices recovered rapidly.&amp;#x200b;[you can do it, billy](https://preview.redd.it/6knzf1oarww51.png?width=681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f1ecfd78dfcb1a492f4b776c22bb4d632461f49)as shown here, btc's correlations with gold and silver dropped drastically after the paypal crypto announcement.https://preview.redd.it/8r3jff7jrww51.png?width=1572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89a70c7e582576ab57fc494a3a2b351b4ddb3923for the full coronavirus bitcoin report, head over to:[https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-vs-traditional-assets-who-is-ahead-mid-pandemic](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-vs-traditional-assets-who-is-ahead-mid-pandemic) www.bitcoin4photos.net is a cool webpage i just discovered and wanted to share in case you want to sell your photos there or support it! i am a fairly seasoned bitcoiner at this point and wanted to test the waters to see how paypal was allowing folks to get into crypto. so i bought 5 bucks of crypto from them just to see what it was like.to make a long story short, though its a cool first step, what they have done seems very confusing and rudimentary. i really dont get why someone would want to use paypal to invest in crypto at this point. the only capabilities they seem to have are to 1) buy btc from paypal directly or 2) sell it back to them once you have it. the only good part of the experience was that there were no fees to buy it, though the price i paid for it was slightly higher than the going rate. however, there are no seed phrases given to me, there are no transfers to external wallets, and selling back has a hefty 2.9% fee payable to paypal. it just feels like my dummy test investment money is lost in limbo and it just made me think, if its not behind my keys, it isnt my bitcoin. it wasnt a very good feeling.anyone else try it? curious on your thoughts...

&lt;scriptpubkey&gt;`, but with bip16 and bip141 the concept of deserializing either the `redeemscript` or the `witnessscript` were introduced.  most of this is done outside the scripting engine by the bitcoin client, but here i image a new op-code called `op_deserialize` for the task.  i realize it's fictional, but felt it was easier to present the material with this small imaginary op-code.this makes our complete script assemble a bit more than just `&lt;scriptsig&gt; &lt;scriptpubkey&gt;` in most cases.  i'll go through what that assembly looks like as well as how block explorers or client software identify the seven major transaction types, and how the address is parsed and assembled.  i've also written a [sample script](https://github.com/brianddk/reddit/blob/master/python/transaction_types.py) that will decode these by walking through testnet blocks.***### [pay to pubkey](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/script#obsolete_pay-to-pubkey_transaction)the original bitcoin client defined two fields `scriptsig` and `scriptpubkey` which each contained half of the script needed to validate a transaction.  the two scripts were concatenated together to create a complete script.  here's an example of a pay to pubkey script| p2pk          |size| script || :---          |:---| :---   ||`scriptsig`    |72  | `&lt;sig&gt;`                                                     ||`scriptpubkey` |35  | `&lt;pubkey&gt; op_checksig`                                      ||assembled      |    | `&lt;scriptsig&gt; &lt;scriptpubkey&gt;`                                ||btc_address    |    | `b58_encode(pfx + hash160(spk[1:34]))`                      ||test           |    | `len(spk) == 35 and (spk[0:1] + spk[34:35]).hex() == '21ac'`||total vb       |107 | 72 + 35                                                     |since the op_checksig operation takes two arguments, this can be interpreted as `txin.op_checksig(&lt;pubkey&gt;, &lt;sig&gt;)` from a non-stack based language perspective.  in regards to txn size, the total size of one of these assembled scripts is 107 vb (bytes).  in regards to bitcoin addresses, the address is derived by chopping off the first and last bytes (op codes) from the `scriptpubkey` (`spk`) then performing a `hash160` operation on the data.  the script is recognized by it's length and the first and last op codes (`op_push`, `op_checksig`).in the original client p2pk was used for what was termed "[pay to ip](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.1.5/ui.cpp#l1421)".  in this process, you would enter an ip address in the payto field, and the client would connect to the remote node to receive a `scriptpubkey` from them.***### [pay to public key hash](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/script#standard_transaction_to_bitcoin_address_.28pay-to-pubkey-hash.29)along with p2pk, the original client also supported p2pkh termed "[pay to address](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.1.5/ui.cpp#l1397)".  since addresses were always stored as the `hash160` of the pubkey, this format had the advantage of requiring no secondary piece of information.  all the sender need was the bitcoin address, where as in p2pk the sender needed the `pubkey` and could derive the address.  but `pubkeys` are long and generally not checksumed like bitcoin address notation is.  having the sender only need a small checksumed hash was simpler and became much more widely used, although it does require a larger `scriptsig` making it more expensive to spend| p2pkh        |size| script || :---         |:---| :---   ||`scriptsig`   |106|`&lt;sig&gt;

&lt;scriptpubkey&gt;`.  if that execution fails, then the transaction is invalid.  there is also some debate as to whether or not miners will include these arbitrary transaction types.  one thing for certain is that there is no convention for displaying any type of address for these utxos, since there is no convention for creating one.#### references* [oldest bitcoin core code drops](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/code/)* [current bitcoin core code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)* [bitcoin script reference](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/script)* [a different in-depth bitcoin scripting guide (part 1)](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/best-bitcoin-script-guide/) [(part2)](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/bitcoin-script-guide-part-2/)* [obsolete pay to ip / pay to pubkey](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/script#obsolete_pay-to-pubkey_transaction)* [bip-0016: pay to script hash](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki)* [bip-0141: segregated witness](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki)* [u/brianddk sample script (bitcoinlib) decoding all of these on testnet](https://github.com/brianddk/reddit/blob/master/python/transaction_types.py) coinbaazar laptop/desktop users , we have changed the theme and added more featured on our exchange , please visit [coinbaazar.com](https://coinbaazar.com) , and you can also share your views here ... buy and sell bitcoins with more than 300+ payment methods ...download the coinbaazar app also ... wtf!" sorry! websocket connection broken.  something's wrong with the internet connection to our server. you will have to reload this page. " i wanted to get people's thoughts on both of these major companies offering bitcoin back on purchases through their debit card offering. i am not sure which is the better card and which one should be preferred.the fold card will start issuing their debit cards next week, starting with the first 1000 early access members of which i am a part of. it looks like they will be offering 1-2% bitcoin (only) back on all purchases with their debit card. the good thing here is that it can go up to 2% and you get btc back. the only downside here is, fold is not a very well known company so i would be very hesitant to give them my ssn if they ask for it, which i think they most likely will. if someone can tell me why it's safe to give them my ssn, that would be really helpful.coinbase hasn't indicated when their card will be out but coinbase is a much bigger company and i have already shared my ssn with them. i was very comfortable sharing my ssn with coinbase. only thing here would be timing. i am not sure when their card would be out. the good thing with the cb card is that they seem to be offering 1% btc or 4% stellar xlm back on purchases. so i guess you can chose between both cards.any thoughts on which card would be better and why?also, if you haven't signed up with fold yet, it is definitely worth a try. you can use this link to get 20,000 sats to get started.

[removed] [removed] at this point it's quite likely biden will be scotus, meaning he will enact lockdowns that could entail the economy going into a recessionjust wondering how would this affect the price of bitcoin if everything i've said does happen. [removed] [removed] [removed] today i have seen this pinned post in r/ethtrader community by one of their mod discussing that these gang farmers are in all 3 communities which are distributing rewards, and have a discord channel to coordinate it.[https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/jlw7fn/poll\_proposal\_new\_rule\_in\_response\_to\_donut/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/jlw7fn/poll_proposal_new_rule_in_response_to_donut/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)so it's pretty right that even in r/cryptocurrency there are some gang farmers out there but how are we gonna tackle them?in my opinion, reddit has to develop some algo that if the same users are upvoting them continuously just right after posting something here should be removed,and r/cc can also introduce rule like if a person has at least 500 comment karma in this sub can post something.what are your thoughts on this. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i've noticed alot of people here saying that the united states will try and make it harder and more expensive to deal with crypto but is there anyone here with an educational pov that can give us the most logical plan of action from our government? i'm scared to invest my life savings into something if it can be outlawed with haste. but i also know bitcoin will be relevant until at least 2140 when the last one is mined, something we can't say will be garuanteed with any company today which is my main motivation for me switching where i put my savings. is it possible to create a pie or some sort where i could put my money and it will automatically distribute it into to my portfoliokinda like coinseed or like m1 financei know gemini used to have this service but not sure if it got discontinuedi stop adding money into my wealthfront portfolio and i want to start investing into cryptocurrency [removed] [removed] [removed] need literature for my master thesis about blockchain technology (cryptocurrencies) and how it can be seen as a threat for national security (financing terrorism, buying at dark web etc.) preferably science papers and books. thanks a lot. [removed] [removed] some of us here have lost money, from a few bucks to hundreds if not thousands of dollars, buying one shitcoin or the other. we end up beating ourselves up for the bad investment decision. but here's a little consolation for you.an indian [spent](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-54759863) almost $42k to buy an "aladdin's lamp," hoping it would bring him wealth and health. he was even asked to pay $201,200 but settled with a down payment of $41,600.and the scariest thing is that the bloke is a doctor. yes, a doctor!&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/qoz4wfthrtw51.jpg?width=648&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8af117ba3eb44893c1e11956ec373be31ec3d347 [removed] ok guys, so i work in the traffic department of the state government in a third world country, and i see a lot, and i really mean a very big amount of bribery where i work (not specifically in my sector). some colleagues in other cities make 5 times their salary only on bribery monthly, and it pretty much disgusts me.obviously they only take cash, because otherwise it would raise suspicion from the "irs" here with bank transfers and such. this results in many problems such for the non corrupt employees as having the same salary for 8 years now, even with a 50% inflation during this time.we already have had tried to go on strike (i think that's what is called) without success because those people that take huge amounts of bribery, which are the biggest branches didn't join, so basically it was a mess and had no results.you can't open any business without paying some money to whoever works in the city hall that takes charge of the sector you're trying to enter, or building any construction without paying someone there as well. and this goes on on every level, for example there was a senator like a week ago that got caught up hiding cash in his underwear when federal police arrived, and it wasn't the first one to do so. i honestly think corruption is the biggest problem in third world countries.point is, monero and other privacy coins facilitates this by a huge amount for obvious reasons, once someone took a bribery much more easily it can't be tracked anymore, and this is something that i think that needs to be addressed in such cases. of course there is a huge positive side on having a privacy coin so you can spend your money without being constantly watched (to name one), but i think the downside in places such as where i live is more relevant.what do you guys think about it? we all know it - continuously refreshing the mobile phone for the newest  prices, responding in five telegram groups at once and browsing the web  for the newest information surrounding crypto. all of it often during  school or work time, eating away your attention and driving up your stress levels.# what to do to calm down, get more focused and charge your batteries again?**activities:**there are obvious things to do that help pretty immediately:* sports (indoor, outdoor),* taking walks, letting fresh air into your lungs (without your phone),* occupy yourself with completely else to clear your mind for some time (manual things like cooking, cleaning)**habits:*** don't let your phone be the first and last thing you hold in your hands during the day* there are certain apps that track your phone time - you even can set limits to the use of certain apps* grant yourself some scheduled time when you can stare into the charts and check prices* or estimate a certain day a week when you stay of completely# becoming more conscious and live the moment through meditationthis needs more time to achieve because there are some interesting **authors** and **books** involved to study. i for example think that **eckhard tolle** is a very inspiring person. one book that he is well known for and that i recommend is:*  ***the power of now***: a guide to spiritual enlightenmentit is a book about being freed from compulsive thinking and also from "*the prison of your mind*" by becoming enlightended and more consious by living in the moment.another author that i recommend - he gives very practical tipps how to meditate - is **yongey mingyur rinpoche**, a buddhist teacher.* ***the joy of living:*** unlocking the secret and science of happinesshopefully you'll find some piece of thoughts to take away - to slow down, get more conscious and thus more relaxed and happy - let me end this with a quote from **lao tzu** (chinese philosopher):*if you are depressed, you are living in the past.**if you are anxious, you are living in the future.**if you are at peace, you are living in the present.* i think it's 4 of us now it the group and all of us want to sell some moons, so we need someone who wants to buy.if someone wants to buy moons pm senatusspqrhe found a way how we can trade moons easy almost without any fees. we currently need buyers because in our group are only people who want to sell, so we can't do anything. the trade is done with a middle man. trades are basically based on trust. he takes just 0.5% of a transaction. i guess this is good to keep him motivated to do this and not to scam someone. we did some small transactions and it was good, he's a good guy. you can check his karma points and reputation. i believe he won't risk his reputation by doing anything stupid. ask him for the details. [removed] what is the best crypto hardware wallet?i was thinking of getting the ledger but heard about the hack therefore im thinking about the trezor one now. i only hold 3 coins - any suggestions as to which one will be best ? moon farmers have already reaped their rewards from spamming memes and with the next distribution should gain alot of power when it comes to proposals against memes and karma limits. since they will hold a large portion of the moons and as such will gain a influencing power in votes. is it not better to limit moon influence in the polls. like cap it at a certain point? they could also potentially band together and overthrow some polls to always win. what are your thoughts on the matter? [removed] [removed] the week has just started and its already gone off with a bang with a $300 drop in two minutes.its going to be an incredibly volatile week. the election, new lockdown starting in uk and already happening in most of europe, oil prices hitting 6 month lows because of new lockdowns.i've got everything on a ledger and just leaving it there and riding this week out, even though i suspect we're going to a 12.5k level and could go lower. whats your plans for bitcoin this week? [removed] the purpose of this is to try to figure out what kind of supply and demand situation we have right now.   let's see how many people here want to buy moon and how many want to sell. of course there are also other groups of people who want to use it for buying premium stuff on reddit, tipping other users on reddit, holding it and wait for better times and doing other things.[view poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/jmklgd) [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] with over 200 indexers in mission control we're thrilled to invite curators to join us on the journey to mainnet launch!  learn how you can complete curator missions, contribute to the graph, and earn an early stake in the network[https://thegraph.com/blog/curator-program-launch](https://thegraph.com/blog/curator-program-launch) im not a big time trader, but am interested in investing a little each month in a market analysis tool to help with my day trading (i have quite a spread of different crypto).is https://intotheblock.com any good - are there other alternatives that people recommend? if its actually useful $8-10 a month sounds pretty reasonable?

[removed] currently the difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks by taking the average time for each of those blocks to be mined, dividing it by 10 minutes, and scaling difficulty accordingly.what are the benefits of this approach compared to taking the moving average of the last 2016 blocks? my understanding is that alts like bitcoin cash use a moving average, but because its an average over a much shorter period of time, the probabilistic nature of mining would result in big changes to difficulty, even if the actual mining hashes per second were the same. but is there any downsides to still using a moving average, but over the much larger sampling period (2016 blocks)? around 2014-2015 there was a bitcoin wallet web app that stored coins online. to access your wallet you had to save some large alphanumeric string and use that as part of the url path or url parameter. ifrc, it was somehow tied to namecoin, or some similar tech, and you were able to send bitcoins to usernames instead of public keys.i'm really wondering about their use of those long alphanumeric strings in the url to get to accounts. did that end up being insecure? anyone know what that app was called and if it's still running? assuming i buy something somewhere and theres a paypal button?thank you hey yall, i have an opportunity to acquire large amounts of bitcoin miners (antminer l3+ a3, etc). i'm not particularly interested on bitcoin mining. is there any sort of other thing i can do with them without busting my ass to modify it? ie, running a server, running desktop programs, etc? hey guys,curious if anybody has experience using cypher wheel? (ref: https://www.cyphersafe.io)if i put this through an x ray? e.g in my backpack going through the airport, wouldnt it reveal my words to whoever is looking at the screen? hi everyone. i had a power outage on my pi and now i've been forced to 'delete and repair' my raspiblitz node. it was all going well as i opted to torrent the chain but then there was another power cut. now apparently the torrents have finished, but i can't get bitcoind to start. well it tells me that its starting. then it tells me it isn't running. happy to post the output of any terminal commands. any advice would be really appreciated. cheers! i don't even think being a bitcoin broker is a "thing" yet, but what if i were to start my own business in which i buy and sell btc for people for a small % of commission with each transaction? it's just like a stock broker taking a % of commission, but instead of buying and selling stocks, i'll buy and sell btc. my clientele would probably be older people that are not so familiar with btc but are starting to consider investing in it. i think this demographic of people is quite large. if this a good business idea? get 20% off binance fees with the binance referral

hit a few aths. basically every month is an ath in sats, the stack keeps growing. this month my fiat net worth also hit an ath due to the price hike. and also, the purchase i made this month was with

brings into question the security practices at kraken as a whole.how this came about: in september kraken introduced\[1\] a measure to confirm your device. for this they send a code to your email address. i lost access to my email address. i lost access because i choose to limit the amount of personal data i leave on internet websites (see [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com) for why) and i used a second gmail account i keep for general internet meanderings. this account had a phone number associated with it from a throw-away sim card i no longer have. gmail have locked me out of that email account with no method to recover (spent hours trying). gmail policy on this issue is unclear and some times they will allow one to login without the phone number and some times not. i had hoped this would happen with this email address, but alas two events have collided to make costly these policies and my attempts to protect privacy.if this all sounds strange, it is. i am not a drug dealer or engaged in illegal activities. instead, i work with and protect journalists, human rights lawyers, activist. i explore the edges of privacy and anonymity so that i can better understand the threats they face. i am absolutely ready to give up the non-trivial amount of money that was in the kraken account or to hire a lawyer instead to challenge the coercive behavior of tech companies that increase the degree to which they ask people to compromise their privacy. we are told to enable 2fa, and we do, then told to add their app, then told to never clear cookies or browser cache? where does this stop? i hope that presenting such a challenge may protect others in the future. i have no issue having video calls with or meeting with lawyers but absolutely will refuse to do this with kraken when i have all the valid credentials needed for my account and then some. (again, i lost access to my account because of a change in cookie policy at kraken, not due to anything that happened with my account)if you know of a lawyer or are interested in helping with this case, please dm&amp;#x200b;1.

[removed] [removed] with the presidential election happening so soon, many analysts and industry experts are wondering how solid bitcoins future will be. each candidate represents a different outcome for the worlds number one digital currency. many analysts believe that the economy will be considerably stronger under donald trumph, which means that the price of btc could potentially be slow to rise, while biden is likely to bring falls in the stock market, which may give bitcoin a chance to spike faster.https://preview.redd.it/hfubtnfdxzw51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e99c33a0a57eb01957e607cd5b18bf41ea99d22 i used to only get charged like $1-$2 usd per transaction.what is going on wtf could someone please post real examples of the different prices for buying and selling btc on those two apps?&gt;!replace "btc" by "fake btc", "btc derivative" or whatever tf this is not about that but just about the spread. thank you.!&lt; so if you would have say purchased $400.00 worth of bit coin when the price was $4,000.  would that $400 be worth 3x as much so tech it would be around $1200?

(https://youtu.be/dk0-6p8kxhg) [removed] "not your keys, not your coins" very, very true. but it's  the future of bitcoin .. and that's okay.not having the keys to a wallet isn't going to stop the great majority of future users from "owning" and using bitcoin via paypal/et al for everything they want to use it for -- be it spending or saving. in the coming years, i think most people will be using services akin to paypal to manage their bitcoins, never truly "owning" their coins, and not care about it at all as long as the value of their account is retained. eventually, "not your keys, not your coins" people (myself included) will resemble old-timey folks who buried valuables in the forest to keep them safe (not your hidden hole, not your gold nuggets).whether or not people have their own keys will mean nothing towards the value and usability of their "bitcoin." just like people who lease cars instead of buying one. "not your title, not your car." 100% accurate, but who cares? people who lease cars couldn't care less about owning a car; they still are able to drive around just as much as anyone who bought their car.in fact, lots of people may not want the responsibility of keeping track of their own wallet keys and would prefer to outsource the security of it to paypal or eventually their local bank. we do that already with all of our fiat money. "not your keys, not your coins" .. after you cash out, it's not your money anyway! anyone who cashes out their bitcoin to fiat immediately hands over their fiat to their bank. you think it's still your money? it's not, and we all know it. it's the bank's money, and you just trust them that the value of your account will be retained. "not your mattress, not your money." we trust them so implicitly, so blindly, that we still feel it's our money and move about in life as if it were. zero difference to the keyless majority future of bitcoin.people just want security. we trust banks, so we sign our life savings over to them. eventually we'll trust crypto banks the exact same way. eventually crypto deposits will be fdic insured (or the equivalent). eventually we'll have bitcoin fraud purchase protection and reimbursement just like our credit cards. eventually we'll have lifelock for our bitcoin accounts. holographic cryptography will eventually make accounts unhackable. none of this will require anyone to have the keys to a bitcoin wallet.heck, having the keys to your wallet written out and stashed somewhere may become the weakest link. might as well leave a disguise kit that looks like you somewhere for a stranger to find and include a roadmap to your local bank branch paperclipped to a pre-signed withdrawal slip.anonymous wallets with 12 word keys will become the "cash" version of bitcoin that's only as secure as they keys are hidden, while the actually safe and keyless bitcoins could be stored in checking/savings accounts locked behind fingerprint/voice/face/ retinal scan security with a pin on top.as long as trust, security, and liability are in the mix for people's crypto accounts, "not your keys, not your coins" will become the muttering of a cranky grandpa.all of that trust, security, and liability will most certainly be developed over time because consumers will demand it and corporations will want to profit .. but until then, "not your keys, not your coins." ;-) yeah please im in switzerland and im trying to get the best platform to buy some bitcoins about $3,000? any help please ? please utilize this sticky thread for all general **bitcoin** discussions! if you see posts on the front page or /r/bitcoin/new which are better suited for this daily discussion thread, please help out by directing the op to this thread instead. thank you!if you don't get an answer to your question, you can try phrasing it differently or commenting again tomorrow.[join us in the r/bitcoin chatroom!](https://s.reddit.com/channel/872992_7f67f22e296c2f65bd39f5af98f30a96b5e3e21e)please check the [previous discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/jmlgem/mentor_monday_november_02_2020_ask_all_your/) for unanswered questions. girl is a data scientist and investing came up, i mentioned crypto and she seemed intrigued. i remembered that last dude on here who started talking bitcoin on his first date and i was like... don't fuck this up.gave her the low down and she seemed intrigued. there is a second date planned.

[removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] over the last couple of years, billions of dollars have been poured into the blockchain and digital currency markets. ambitious projects are actively creating next-gen solutions for many of the problems that we are dealing with today. due to the highly competitive nature of the space, picking out the right project to invest in tends to become troublesome.in this article, we will provide readers with a presentation of earnbet - a decentralized cryptocurrency casino boasting a lucrative investment opportunity.earnbet is not your average casino. it is a fully-decentralized, non-custodial, and on-chain gambling platform offering a series of highly-entertaining games and support for over 12 popular cryptocurrencies. the casino has adopted a profit-sharing philosophy, meaning that players and investors can stake bet tokens to receive monthly dividends.exploring earnbets staking featurethe staking feature was designed to be straightforward for both players and investors.every time a player wagers on a game, they receive bet tokens as a reward. at this point in time, 1 bet token is offered for every 0.02 btc thats wagered. over the long run, loyal players can earn a considerable amount of bet tokens, thereby reaping multiple rewards.investors who are not interested in gambling can easily purchase bet tokens from one of the multiple supported exchanges. these include uniswap, binance dex, p2pb2b, newdex, and hotbit.once a user has obtained a viable number of bet tokens, these coins can be staked for a predetermined period of time. the longer the lock-up period, the more staking points a user will receive. as such, a 7-days lock-up period entails a point multiplier of 1.10x, whereas users who stake for five years will receive points worth 8.88x of their original stake.100% of earnbets btc and eth profits are then distributed in the form of dividends. profits obtained in other coins will be utilized to buy back bet tokens, as expressed in a subsequent section of the article.distribution is made according to the number of stake points held by each customer. so far, over $3.8 million have been paid out to users who decided to stake their bet tokens. with this in mind, investors can obtain considerable returns, based on the overall profitability of the casino.the bet token can also be leveraged to decrease the house edge. in doing so, users can increase their odds and access a higher theoretical return to player (rtp).understanding the tokenomics of betits important to point out that bet tokens have accumulated quite a bit of value. at press time, bet is valued at $0.029. assuming a 5-year stake period, users have generated an apy of 51.26% over the last two months. from an all-time perspective, the apy is approximated at 129.1%.thanks to a recent community vote, earnbet has decided to buy back a significant percentage of its tokens, which will then be burned. this deflationary strategy will improve bets value in the long-term. consequently, purchasing bet tokens for staking purposes is less risky when compared to other investments. once the staking period is finalized, investors can simply sell their tokens if theyre unsatisfied with their monthly dividend pay-outs. given the rising value of bet, this sale will likely generate profits by itself.based on everything that has been highlighted so far, earnbet aims to cater to both gamblers and investors, by providing entertaining games alongside an innovative investment opportunity. hello everyone,i talked with the moderator and they approved me posting here!we are a family business running over 25 years, located in serbia.we mainly sell perfumes that are made in serbia and they are inspired by popular scents. so far we have 3 retail stores in our city and a few franchises in other cities.they are branded as "chez pierre" which is our company name.our main goal is to deliver high-quality fragrance for the lowest price possible!we recently decided to accept **bitcoin** as a payment method on our website.the big reason for that is that paypal sucks ass.when you are leaving in a country that's not in the european union, you have limited service of choosing payment methods and if you want to sell it worldwide well paypal is your only option.paypal often time limits your payments, has a reversal hold on every transaction, asks a lot of documentation (which is fine) but their customer support never answers if something is out of a script and oftentimes you cannot even communicate with them. last 12 months we had twice money frozen without an explanation and it was really hard to talk with them.let's not start talking about their fees, they cannot compare to bitcoin.overall it might be easier for the buyer to make a paypal account and just purchase, but from the seller side, it's really a nightmare. everyone is trying to avoid them and there is a reason why.that's why we decided to encourage people to use bitcoin and we are offering 10% off using code **sale10** for bitcoin purchases!if you are a small business owner start accepting bitcoin now, it's not that hard to set up and it's very easy to use.our website is: [https://shop.chezpierre.rs/](https://shop.chezpierre.rs/)if you have any questions please let us know!ps: if anything happens with your order do not worry, we got you covered! if it does not arrive, we ship it express! [removed] [removed] [removed] # new meme and media rulesas many of you know, we had a community vote to limit memes and media posts to only being allowed on the weekends. this vote passed and is now in effect. please limit posting of image and gif links to saturday and sunday.# additional rules added about postingwe have also tweaked one of the existing rules and added an additional rule to try to mitigate spammers and limit people from just spamming 800 memes on the weekend:* users can only post content once per 24 hours per domain, news, or  social media outlet - sites caught using multiple accounts to self  promote will be banned and blacklisted.* users can only make a maximum of three posts per 24 hoursthe first rule already existed but was tweaked to include any domain, not just news or social media. the second rule is brand new. these rules will be enforced throughout the week, and will include people posting memes on the weekend. so, a user can only post one link from [i.redd.it](https://i.redd.it) or [imgur.com](https://imgur.com) per day on the weekend, and can post no more than three links per day.we're trying to limit people from just carpetbombing the sub with memes on the weekend as well as deal with some folks that are just spamming tons of articles through the week. if you notice anyone breaking these rules please use the report button with a description of why you're reporting or just send us a modmail. [removed] from yesterday i am observing here there are no more meme/media posts in r/cryptocurrencymods are really doing great and deleting all the memes here right after posting.this is making this sub so informative and people are writing the whole story about something rather than just dropping a media file with a title.i personally believe meme should be permaban here as there is already a separate sub for meme r/cryptocurrencymemeswhat do you guys think about this? [removed] metamask swap feature is live for me, just checked my extension this working and there it is.you should see a little welcome intro to swapping and how it works. there is also a swap button next to the buy and sell buttons.i'm pretty excited for it, i wonder if uniswap is going to get rekt'd or if we're going to get a airdrop of some sorts if metamask comes out with its own token lol [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] i have been a bag holder for awhile, and i feel like this year is comparable too being invited to a party that your skeptical about, but you get there and see a couple a cute girls and decide to stay...a bit then everyone hears about and the places gets packed!im intrigued to see what happens at the end of the year and if there is anymore explosive activity it looks like many people are literally trying to harvest moons.i simply do not understand the reason behind it, do they count that one day there will be some interesting price on a coin?i mean this is highly unlikely considering the coin use case, from where the value would come from? who would pay for a token allowing you to have some perks on your reddit profile?

ceo says this will fundamentally bolster the use of cryptocurrencies.quote from dan schulman, paypal's president and ceo:&gt; enabling somebody who holds a cryptocurrency in a paypal account to instantaneously transfer that crypto into fiat currency at a step rate, so volatility is taken out of the equation, no incremental fees charged for them to do that transaction from crypto into a fiat. and then immediately settle in fiat with all $28 million of our merchants at our current take rates and so you have no additional integration needed at any of our merchants. and this is just an elegant way of using cryptocurrencies as a funding mechanism.paypal says this has a lower cost for them compared to funding accounts with nach, etc.2. paypal plans to dramatically change how people use both paypal as well as venmo. crypto seems to be a big part of this. venmo will get crypto features in the first half of 2021. paypal will also expand internationally and enable crypto across different geographies.3. they have only rolled out crypto to 10% of users, but even among these users they have seen more interest in people opening the apps just to check the prices:&gt; now we've only rolled this out to 10% of our base. we did that a couple of days ago, but our waiting list was 2 times to 3 times of what our expectations were. we're going to take up our $10,000 limit per day to $15,000 per day based on the demand that we're seeing and we'll roll out to 100% in the u.s.&gt; we're seeing people who've already bought crypto, open their wallets several times a day to check on what's happening with their crypto investments.4. regarding crypto as a whole, and cbdc's:&gt;  my conversations with central banks, with the regulators, with a number of folks in the crypto field, there's no question that digital currencies are going to be rising in importance, having increasing functionality and increasing prominence. cbdcs, from my perspective and all my conversations, are a matter of when and how they're done, not if. and i think that our platform, with its digital wallets and the scale that we have right now, can help shape the utility of those currencies.full transcripts: https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/11/03/paypal-holdings-pypl-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcr/ [removed] this will be hidden. am working on editing a long text post. just want to see if the paragraphs work in mobile and if comments loadaaaaaaaaaaaaahdhsjskskslslslsksnsnsjsjwmskskskksaaaa [removed] if you want to get to know a person here on r/cryptocurrency all you need is to ask that question. the answer on that question with an additional explanation can trigger a broad aspect of different emotions like condemnation, irritability, aggressiveness, but also a deep connection, admiration, respect and warm approval.sorry for just 6 options. this is the maximum number of options for polls. i tried to pick those which i think are most popular here. i could be probably wrong.[view poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/jn7j2b) [removed] [removed] [removed] so ive been trying for 3 days to buy bitcoin.first stop coinbase. already have an account and already bought from them via credit card. ok so they dont take credit card anymore, or atleast my credit card. try debit card, they dont take it aswell.next stop: bitbuy.ca apparently a big site in canada to quickly buy crypto. good, make an account, add funds via interact e-transfer. they give me all the info needed for the e transfer and couple hours later my bank says the e transfer was accepted by bitbuy.ca. i wait.. 24hrs later. still 0$cad in my bitbuy account  i contact them. thet say they dont have the payment. i  contact my bank and then interact themself, they both says payment went thru.ok so wtf is going on there idk. but i cant wait no more. i want some more bitcoin before election but i cant get some.  i check over at paypal canada but i dont think they offer crypto yet. or atleast i couldnt find it.any1 has a good canadian site where i can buy btc in less than 12hrs.should be simple, no??? is this 2014 or 2020. not sure at this point. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] bitcoin closes out the month making gains against spx of 24.6% from open @ 3.18 to close @ 4.23 ratio blx/spx booking the 2nd highest close in history of bitcoin and thus closing above long term resistance @ a ratio of 3.81.recent high in june 2019 blx/spx ratio peaked @ 4.72 but failed to maintain support above key level of 3.81 closing the month @ 3.65.the only month to close above 3.81 ratio was december 2017 which had a high of 7.38 and the highest monthly close @ 5.2.  if bitcoin can maintain support above the previous key resistance we can look for bitcoin to test the previous high of 4.72 set june 2019. then with a strong close above the previous high from june 2019 the next targets would be monthly closes around 5.20 and on to test all time high ratio of 7.38.

[removed] i know i'm stupid, help me understand. watching tmg's video on this axion exit scam made me think of casino royale and how i've never understood the mechanics of these schemes; how does crashing the price of something after you've cashed out somehow make that money more valuable?

[removed] my first port of call had to be r/bitcoin as without taking the advice of you fine people i would never have been able to afford my swanky time piece. ive been trying to get it to work but my lightning transactions never go through. i need .003 bitcoin to borrow to verify an coinpye account i will give it back message me on discord fghklklk#9986. i'm not good with gifts at all. last year i bought my xmas presents the day before xmas and i just got them hershey kisses. i felt kind of bad, so this year i was thinking to get them something better and not last minute. the thing is, i don't really know what anyone in my family likes, so i was considering getting them ledgers even though they dont know what bitcoin is. would this present be one where they would look back at it in 10 years and be like "wow that was one of the best presents i ever got" or will it be like "i cant believe he got me a dumb flash drive" we all know bitcoin is decentralized, open source, neutral, available to anyone with internet, hack proof, unforgeable, impossible to debase, disinflationary, and censorship resistant.but did you also know that bitcoin frees you from other people having control over your wealth? once your wealth is stored in bitcoin, no other entity on earth could steal all or part of it. not governments with inflation or cops. not some russian hacker. (maybe a nigerian scammer if you're gullible and just hand it over.)this is why bitcoin is digital gold. in fact, the "gold" part of that description tarnishes bitcoin. bitcoin is far superior to gold. dividing gold is hard. bitcoin has sub-penny precision. can't buy stuff online with gold. https://purse.io lets you buy anything from amazon with bitcoin and you get a discount. to verify gold, you need a $15,000 tester. with bitcoin you just open your bitcoin wallet. selling gold has huge transaction fees based on a fixed percentage. i usually spend around $0.04 in bitcoin for my transaction fees. and if i wanted to sell bitcoin (like an idiot) for fiat money, the fees on that are 0-2% depending on which bitcoin exchange you use. there's lots. they're online, so it's right there on your phone. do you know how much it costs to send $1.15 billion in gold? me neither. maybe $50 million? it only cost about $3.50 to do it the other with bitcoin. physically moving gold takes way longer than getting paid in bitcoin instantly, with final settlement taking 10 minutes on average. plus, gold sets off metal detectors. good luck flying with gold. they will confiscate/steal it. meanwhile bitcoin can be held in your memory with 12 words. good luck catching that on a metal detector.when gold goes up in price, the gold mines mine more gold and push the price back down by increasing supply. bitcoin doesn't have that limitation. bitcoin is mined on a set schedule that gets cut in half every 4 years. imagine the price of gold if half of all the gold mines in the world all ran dry at the same time. cutting the supply rate in half creates a massive valuation increase.bitcoin wins over gold by probably 1000x. bitcoin is email. gold is the pony express. today's gold market cap is $7 trillion. today's bitcoin market cap is $261 billion.bitcoin is the hardest money ever created, and as such, bitcoin will destroy the value of all other stores of wealth until only the next hardest ones survive and all the weakest ones (shitcoins and weak economies fiat money) are destroyed.bitcoin is already at all time highs against a few fiat currencies. thousands of shitcoins came pretending they were a bitcoin killer. bitconneeeeeeeeeect and a thousand more are already dead. bch and it's double shitcoin cousin bsv are at all time lows to btc and dropping until the network becomes completely unprofitable, at which point they just shut it off and everyone abandons it.bitcoin isn't just a consensus mechanism for wealth, bitcoin is the consensus mechanism for wealth.hyperbitcoinization is inevitable. the more people realize this, the faster it happens. what can i do with 0.04 worth of bitcoin? dear peoplenice plants for your home / office / as a present for someone?they are from 30 cm till 45 cm high.i have a nice collection of plants, it is my hobbyaloe vera, bromelie, dragon, wunder plant, and many more  each 10 -11 euraustralian kastanie with 3 nuts and 3 branches  45 cm high  13 eurqueen calathea  45 cm high, 14 eurthey live with me - dreimhlenviertel, 80469, munich.first come, first servemy whats app: +49 175 830 3585&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/rselwrzc7ax51.jpg?width=1581&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ce85878770431c45fd25ed2dfa3b2cc0c5e1603https://preview.redd.it/y320kxzc7ax51.jpg?width=1599&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8742bb8b7e0fa1dd9ee2d7d2fa2621c3b62038ehttps://preview.redd.it/4x9xavzc7ax51.jpg?width=761&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74204f3a30cf08efbdb9f99d765a2cb034a13090https://preview.redd.it/o7c81wzc7ax51.jpg?width=1599&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5e896a55c31eba33b3c16ff4acbc29d9593e638https://preview.redd.it/ygeo6a0d7ax51.jpg?width=1176&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba14d1f363f8a1bec492863bb8a0603a43f2392https://preview.redd.it/xhutq00d7ax51.jpg?width=934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f95ea0b1112820ad854715c5fbecf43ce343a5https://preview.redd.it/3mdsm20d7ax51.jpg?width=773&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7862108ba3b4594e3aa56915d3f4629bd5358e9chttps://preview.redd.it/659ju20d7ax51.jpg?width=893&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00ec62026af07ab414c29421fdc2ab1ec87010e9https://preview.redd.it/dift570d7ax51.jpg?width=1599&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08246318f05466582b1e332c2d04809545bef0b6https://preview.redd.it/6h65tzzc7ax51.jpg?width=692&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=427501ba3335879df566108d0d804b514c14acbf *for information purposes only*is it possible to purchase a prepaid visa card from the gas station and pay with a credit card (mastercard) with paypass ?also after buying the prepaid visa card , is it possible to withdraw the money from it at an atm?

[removed] not a word since spring. anyone who knows anything about his disappearance? hey everyone,i've been buying bitcoin everyday for a little over a year now and i've seen the results of steadily buying bitcoin drastically eclipse the returns from my 401k and other traditional investments (my current asset allocation is \~53% stocks, 5% bonds + reits, 27% crypto + stablecoins, 15% cash) so i wanted to share some of the results in case anyone else had been thinking about trying something like this.i've done monthly dca with the top altcoins (eth, xrp, bch, ltc, eos, ada, xtz, xlm, link) since around may of 2020 - these results have been much more mixed (from +19% to -26%). i don't doubt that some would work if you stuck with them, but i've found the most success with bitcoin.high level results:401k returns since 2016: +17% (investing in vanguard mutual funds)btc returns from only dca daily buys in 2019+2020 (as of today $14,000 price): +57%tracking these buys automatically and graphing the prices you buy at (if you buy at regular intervals) will give you a really good idea of when you should take advantage of a large buy. example: when the price crashed in march i saw that the price had fallen below my cost basis (or breakeven price). that along with months of daily price data gave me the confidence to buy the dip (i am usually very skeptical of market timing, and you should be too). but identifying that opportunity and taking action was obviously very lucrative (as of today).i think this being a halving year / post halving year (and the macro backdrop usa printing trillions in stimulus) have helped push the gains higher than they would have been otherwise, but i still think this is the most conservative way to get into bitcoin and will continue the strategy for the foreseeable future.&amp;#x200b;how i set up automatic dca + profit tracking with google sheets + coinbase pro api + python + aws[https://rhett.blog/2020/10/21/bitcoin-everyday/](https://rhett.blog/2020/10/21/bitcoin-everyday/)results from dca through the first year ($10,000 btc price)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiquagjut1q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiquagjut1q)&amp;#x200b;if you have questions / comments about the strategy, let me know i'd love to help out or improve my process :) is it possible to get a btc address from a qr code, if so, how? i am trying to see how much money a scammer received and when i scan the qr i get "bitcoin:bc1q4r32078antul9a7egyjx0uhgcg2ap8f32yw2sl" what can i do with this? below is the scammer's qr code.https://preview.redd.it/q0gyr5wwi9x51.png?width=469&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8c1483b6ee41df4b60b7b901d108cd0d0342193 &amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/9whdoqqbi9x51.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5e79aa73d467148e8aa0f5089d1d0e0e867adb9wednesday crypto art for you guys, hope you like it! 2020 ath! fuuuuuuuucccckkkkkk.these bears have that crazy look in their eye, remember, lets keep them in those fucking cages. ive actually got fucking covid, the only thing i want going down is my temperature. high crypto, low standards.#bullsontheloose simply bitcoin, a channel that breaks down all the daily bitcoin news. from twitter to important updates.\-daily fail!\-meme review!\-daily news!\-daily software releases!\-no shitcoins![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5lfovwlrw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5lfovwlrw) this is a complete hypothetical, but i was wondering if someone smarter than me could explain the potential of blockchain based voting systems. while changing voting procedure is no easy task could the blockchain be a secure way to hear the voice of the people?

[removed] my wife and i discussed buying btc a few years back. don't you dare buy into that scam she said. well let's just say i don't always listen to my wife. dca for a while now with 3x gain so far. she doesn't have a clue. but i realized that i now put bitcoin in charge of my marriage. happily ever after or divorce bound? i was wondering if there is a bank that has a physical location in the northeastern us that is ok with buying bitcoin. i have spoken to wells fargo, td bank, and first trust, and all have told me they would close my account if i transferred funds from my checking account to a bitcoin exchange. does anyone use a bank with a physical location that is ok with purchasing bitcoin in decent sized amounts (let's say $25k)?thanks im trying to buy but it keeps saying there was a problem and crashing this is what it says on their website:&gt;all cryptocurrency custody and trading is performed for paypal by its licensed service provider, paxos trust company, llc.you aren't getting a bitcoin wallet, your buy/sell/spend won't be included on the ledger, and you are probably not even triggering any on-chain action in the long run either.paxos trust simply owns a fuck-ton of bitcoin already (that's why it's called a trust), and will use that as collateral in case paypal needs to pay out more us$ (and any other national/regional currencies its customers normally use) than it can handle with it's own internal holdings....(whether or not it's useful to promote and use paypal for bitcoin-based investments is your personal choice.  i'm just giving you the information about how the company is doing things.) new pay depot bitcoin atms at **friendly food mart - new jersey**check out **friendly food mart** to get the lowest possible transaction fees when you buy or sell your cryptocurrency with pay depot.bitcoin atms at **friendly food mart** in new jersey locations:[1900 green tree road, cherry hill, nj 08003](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1qkjhyaw-g5t6xupw8v81mveovpqcrykb&amp;usp=sharing)google map link: [https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1qkjhyaw-g5t6xupw8v81mveovpqcrykb&amp;usp=sharing](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1qkjhyaw-g5t6xupw8v81mveovpqcrykb&amp;usp=sharing)https://i.redd.it/0b2ionn1x8x51.giffor support, you can email us [support@paydepot.com](mailto:support@paydepot.com)price = current market pricelimit = $800/$3000 dailyid: required for purchases over $800\-------------------------------------------------------------follow us[https://twitter.com/atm\_near\_me](https://twitter.com/atm_near_me)or[https://www.facebook.com/atm.bitcoin](https://www.facebook.com/atm.bitcoin)to get the latest location and promotional event news[https://paydepot.com/map](https://paydepot.com/map) is money secure once i purchase bitcoin on gemini? or should i be sending it to another wallet? how do you approach dollar cost averaging with btc? do you invest an amount every day, week, or month? do you buy a percentage during the dips? if you want a very screen-friendly and nice looking version of the white paper, or a nice poster sized version that would look nice hung up somewhere, check out these newly created versions a friend of mine just created.  free to use however you want.[https://www.klausnordby.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\_whitepaper\_document\_hd.pdf](https://www.klausnordby.com/bitcoin/bitcoin_whitepaper_document_hd.pdf)[https://www.klausnordby.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\_whitepaper\_poster\_24x30.pdf](https://www.klausnordby.com/bitcoin/bitcoin_whitepaper_poster_24x30.pdf) [removed] so, ive been thinking about where to store my seed words for my hardware wallet. having them in plain text scares me a little bit, especially if i imagine a world where lots of people could recognize a 24 word seed for what it is. that world might not be as far off as we think. the complete seed just carries too much access.so i was thinking, what if i just switch out one of the words? one that i feel im gonna easily remember. that should make the seed completely useless to a thief right? a thief would ofc not know if the wallet has been deleted (if thats even possible) or if many words are wrong, not just one.any thoughts? &amp;#x200b;![video](kzeb25ez68x51) [removed] [removed] when i wrote down my 24 words for my ledger nano, by chance the last word had some personal meaning to me, something that i will never forget.as extra security i didn't write down that 24th word, but changed that last word with a random word (tower) i put those 24 words in a safety deposit box.i was wondering if someone get hold of those 24 words, how long would it take them to discover that the last word is incorrect, is it easy to brute-force it to get to my real 24 words? [removed] this is a post to see if my understanding is correct. so, if i purchase $100 worth of btc and the price goes up $100 i make $100? as i have a friend that has purchased exactly that and even though it was up $100 it only increased by $1. so, if that understanding is wrong what is the right one? hi, i made an account on coinbase commerce, saved my mnemonic, got my payment for invoices, and everything worked awesome.later on when i tried to withdraw, i found out i don't control my bitcoin, the seed coinbase generated isn't a real one. it is not the one used to generate addresses for my customers, therefore i access the wallet only thru coinbase website.the issue here is: coinbase commerce always set transaction fees to highest ever possible, and don't give u the choice to choose your own fees, making it charge me 20$ on a 100$ withdraw!i've read on reddit that they changed the derivation path for addresses generated for bitcoin, and it is a lie, u can't proof that, i tried every single derivation path possible and none of them gave me the addresses that coinbase commerce generates.people should immediately stop using coinbase commerce as payment processor and find a better alternative. [removed] [removed] hi satstackers,ive bought a small portion of btc so far, looking to buy more.now i want to use the crypto.com app cuz that was the most straight forward for me but i have a question; how high/low are the transaction fees from purchasing btc on crypto.com app to ledger nano x transfer?help is very appreciated and stay stacking [removed] i just bought a bit of bitcoin on cash app and coinbase. i was able to move from both of those onto an electrum wallet easily enough but when i tried to move from electrum to an offline ledger nano x. my transaction i.d  says "unknown" and its been pending for about 8 hours now. it said the fee was 297 sat/byte which is a decent fee as far as i know. can anyone explain what's going on here? i've been reading articles for hours and feeling pretty lost. i remember claiming bch back in the day and i just realised i should be able to claim bsv as well?ive got the private key from my bitcoin address which i used to claim the bch, how could i claim bsv? im starting to store decent amount on it. im going to add a 25 th key. but people talk about hacking wallets. how can this happen without the private key? can it happen on cold storage ? storing all on a ledger. hi guys i am trying learn the relationship between 256 bit encryption and bitcoins addresses and private keys. i remember something ages ago which showed the bits (256) corresponding with the private key. can someone point me in the direction of such a resource.&amp;#x200b;thanks i am aware there is no-kyc exchanges for crypto, but is there one for forex market exchange was tight spread and fast transaction?&amp;#x200b;any response is appreciated! and thanks beforehand! my tablet died. with it, also went my access to microsoft authenticator, and thus coinbase. so until i get a new one, i thought i'd try to get some bitcoin elsewhere. i found coinmama, which was nice for all of a week or two, now they process payments thru simplex, which requires an sms text to verify an account. same with cex.&amp;#x200b;is there a market left that will allow me to purchase bitcoin in the us without sms verification or 2fa? i don't have a cellphone and my fallback device that i'm using right now, is an old 32-bit windows desktop that i've kept my electrum wallet on. after the majority of population understands bitcoin, the price will never drop again. i just received the scam mails from legder.de (yes, legder.de) in perfect german language with no errors and legit looking.don't fall for it!the link to download a new ledger-live-version directs to http://xk2zn.mjt.lu/lnk/...mail content:sehr geehrte kundin,wir bedauern, ihnen mitteilen zu mssen, dass es in ledger zu einer sicherheitsverletzung gekommen ist. betroffen sind etwa 46.000 unserer kunden. leider ist auch das mit ihrer e-mail-adresse verknpfte wallet (&lt;my mail adr&gt;) von der verletzung betroffen.am 2. november 2020 hat unser forensikteam festgestellt, dass mehrere der verwaltungsserver von ledger live mit malware infiziert sind.derzeit ist es technisch unmglich, die schwere und reichweite der sicherheitsverletzung abschlieend festzustellen. aufgrund dieser gegebenheiten mssen wir davon ausgehen,dass fr ihre kryptowhrungs-assets das risiko besteht, entwendet zu werden.sie erhalten diese e-mail, weil sie von dem vorfall ebenfalls betroffen sind. um ihre assets zu schtzen, laden sie bitte die neueste version von ledger live herunter und folgen sie den anweisungen, um eine neue pin fr ihr wallet festzulegen.mit freundlichen gren,ledgerthis email was sent to &lt;my mail adr&gt;.z1dyzapl because you signed up at legder.com or purchased a legder product. we respect your right to privacy. read ourprivacy policyandcookie policy.  legder sas 2020. all rights reserved. legder brands are registered trademarks of legder sas. legder sas, 1 rue du mail, 75002 paris [removed] [removed] [removed] welcome to the daily discussion. please read the disclaimer, guidelines, and rules before participating.***-**disclaimer:**though karma rules still apply, moderation is less stringent on this thread than on the rest of the sub. therefore, consider all information posted here with several liberal heaps of salt, and always cross check any information you may read on this thread with known sources. any trade information posted in this open thread may be highly misleading, and could be an attempt to manipulate new readers by known "pump and dump (pnd) groups" for their own profit. beware of such practices and exercise utmost caution before acting on any trade tip mentioned here.***-**rules:*** all [sub rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/about/rules/) apply in this thread. the prior exemption for karma and age requirements is no longer in effect.* discussion topics must be related to cryptocurrency.* comments will be sorted by newest first.***-**to see prior skeptics discussions, [click here](https://old.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/search?q=title%3a%22monthly+skeptics+discussion%22+&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).** is this month the one that will make the unclaimed moons from the first round unclaimable or will it be the next month?

[removed] [removed] so once youre going to break even, whats your plan?will you take your money back and say goodbye to crypto, or keep holding hoping to make profit?im really curious to know if there will be a rush of people selling at 20k, while in my opinion, it will be a huge buying signal.please share your point of view. [removed] with bitmex, okex, kucoin, and huobi all seeming to have shit going down with regulators, hacks, etc.  it seems like this will continue. regulators are starting the purge and forcing this industry to become legit.1. these exchanges have no problem freezing your funds for months and worst case you could lose them.  do you really think these exchanges have your best interests in mind? fuck no, they want to look out for themselves.2. withdrawing your coins is good for your coin's price.  we have no proof the exchanges don't run on fractional reserves (remember quadrigacx?).  getting your coins off the exchange means less market manipulation, is healthier for coin price, and gives you peace of mind.want crypto to see more mainstream adoption and your coin's price to go up? want to see a bitcoin etf? do your part and remove your coins from the exchanges. hey guys i have a bunch of different crypto but i'd like to move it all to an offline zip drive. i was hoping to get some help on the best way to proceed.thanks for everything guys and gals.i appreciate it.sognos [https://www.blockchaincenter.net/cryptocurrency-world-map/](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/cryptocurrency-world-map/)&amp;#x200b;i stumbled across this really interesting cryptocurrency world map that uses google trends to determine what country is searching for what cryptocurrency. i enjoyed it so thought i would share. [removed] [removed] [removed] i wanted to buy something online. that seller accepted only wire transfers and bitcoin. i first wanted to do the wire transfer but it seems like i have to ask my bank to unlock that wire transfer to that sellers country, so i decided to do the bitcoin since he also offered 10% lowered price if i paid via bitcoin.well the issue i have is, i transfered 40 euros to coinbase wallet. and i knew i'd have some fees... what i didn't know is that, transferring 40 euros to the coinbase wallet, took almost a 1 euro away from my money, so i received only 39 euros with some cents.next step was to convert to bitcoin, that cost me 1,99 ....so o ended up with 37 euros....the thing is, the product costs 36,90 euros....so i thought i had barely enough and i was happy, but at the step where i had to send the money, it asked me another fee of almost a euro ..... which means i was something about 70 cents short....how much is that? almost 5 euros just so i could pay with bitcoin? did i make a mistake? did i use the wrong bitcoin wallet?is that everywhere ? i don't see the point in bitcoin now if it costs me more to send via bitcoin just because of coinbase' fees...anyone has any info about a cheaper way to pay via bitcoin?ps: someone told me to wait for the bitcoin to go up, since i only miss 70 cent... but the value considerably went down instead....ps: i don't mine nor invest bitcoin since i don't have these resources right now. so it's not like i can wait to get more bitcoin. [removed] today i was with my grandpa. on his tv someone mentioned bitcoin on news. he said immediately "huh who cares about this scam". btw my grandpa and nobody in my family knows that i invested in bitcoin and also some alts. this is my biggest secret and i have my reasons for that. won't explain it now.anyway i tried to explain him like to a 5 year old kid and his only argument was "i can't touch it". how to deal with those kind of people? can we help them or just pray for them?

[removed] [removed] i've been investing in cryptos since mid-2018. i probably made a good dozen of transfer from my bank account to coinbase to convert eur to eth. amounts were only a few hundreds each time.last time i made a transfer, my bank called me to question my transfer, but finally validated it...yesterday i tried to make a new one and today my bank called me to explain they will not allow any more of these "crypto-related" transfers, stating that it's for their customer's "best interest"...i kinda get it : a lot of their clients lost a lot of money making dumb/uninformed crypto "investment" and got rekt, blaming the bank for advice !but now here i am, 2 years into crypto, haven't made a positive profit yet but did not get rekt either.i would consider myself as a wise investor, at least as much as one can get in this wild space...**i wanna keep investing so my question to you guys :i still need a gateway bank to transfer and convert my eur, which ones would you recommend that might be "crypto-friendly" ?(looking for real or online banks operating in europe/france)**in the meantime i'm seroously looking into defi for the last few months, hoping i could safely switch to it soon...thank you ! as news came in that an asteroid was heading towards earth, potentially wiping out every living thing on the planet, cryptocurrency investors were surprisingly optimistic about how the impending doom could in fact have a positive effect on the price of bitcoin.commenting in the r/cryptocurrency sub, user 'financiallyindependently' wrote, "i don't see what all the fuss is about. i've been invested in bitcoin since m.t. gox and have seen way bigger threats to bitcoin than some big rock from outer space." another user named 'wenmoon' replied, "i honestly think that once all the dust has settled, this could be the event that finally sees bitcoin hitting a new ath. the fundamentals are still the same. buy the f**king dip!"meanwhile over at r/buttcoin, redditors were feeling euphoric at how the news of the impending asteroid collision had crashed the price of bitcoin by over 40%. "lmao, we told them it was going to zero but they were too deluded to listen! can't wait to see the price after the asteroid hits!" one user commented.elsewhere, nano investors have urged crypto holders to trade their bitcoin for nano, claiming that with only days remaining until the end of the world, it would be madness to have to waste a day of that waiting for a transaction to come through. bitcoin maxis refused to be drawn into the argument, simply replying, "nano. lol."

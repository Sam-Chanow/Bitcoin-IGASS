Hi everyone,   


I'm pretty sure this subject has been explored probably many times before, but I'll give it a go.   


What are the (e)books/Websites/Youtube videos you studied before even entering the crypto and trading world?   


How long have you studied before starting, how would you say it helped you and how different it was on the "D-day" when you used real money? I keep reading that doing simulation accounts is good to practice but is another world compared to the actual trading.   


I'd really love to see what's the best documentation and preparation method to be fully ready.  


Thanks everyone!

Assumptions: Lets pretend for a minute the Broth Childs, who started central banking, own the planet. Lets assume theyre so powerful their name isnt mentioned in the media (or Reddit) and they even own the media to ensure their perpetual existence. Lets assume they own both parties and let us quarrel among tha ourselves while both parties print money for them (wars, welfare, bail outs, stim checks). Lets also assume I dont get murdered for this. What would you do about the greatest threat to your existence - crypto? 


Simple. 

1) Pump and dump people out of the market until no one is willing to buy. 

2) run strategic fud in the controlled media just TA shows a decline for maximum impact 

3) hold congressional hearing circus for more talking points right as you crash it. 

4) use paid off congress to regulate it out of existence or flat out ban mining. 

This sub doesnt talk nearly enough about WHERE manipulation happens and WHY

For the record I am not suicidal.

So, i know that good deeds that you do should be known only by you but today i feel like sharing it on this sub cause the good deed i was able to do was only possible because of crypto. Also, i have no intention of telling my friend or families about what i did so i feel like it be okay to share here cause i belive  that no one here knows me. 
   So, i have never been able to help anyone cause i usually have no money to give but this year thanks to this sub i learned about crypto which have greatly changed my life cause its all thanks to crypto that i'm finally able to help others. Long story short i live pretty close to Myanmar and as such have seen a lot of refugee who greatly need help for their livelihood and as such seeing a donation for the refugee going on i decided to sell my crypto to donate to them. The amount i donated is not that much but i have been feeling so happy the past few days that i wanted to vent out my happiness somewhere and decided to do it here

  IThanks to crypto for the first time in my life eventhough its a small amount i was finally able to help others. 


Also, would like to add if you have any spare change please do consider donating to Ngo that are actually helping the refugee cause they need all the help they can get

The questionable rise of meme coins, bear markets, sudden bull markets, bull traps, rugpulls, scams, you name it, if you've been in this space along this year you sure know what an epic ride this 2021 has been.

Despite that, some of you have been holding gracefully through the hard and complicated times, and that no small feat. It's very easy to enter this market compared to the difficulty that is selling part of your position or just holding, that's why I want to congratulate all those brave souls that are still holding for dear life, you're the real MVP's, without you, the market wouldn't be the same.

Who knows what 2022 will bring to the table, after all, nobody can predict what will happen here, not even the so called TA experts or professionals. That uncertainty is one of the things that makes this crypto market so interesting, fun and enigmatic. I wouldn't like it any other way.

So godspeed y'all, thank you for your perseverance and let's look forward to 2022 in this crazy space!

The discourse in the daily is a bit ridiculous TBH, newbies are constantly entering the market while things are green and it is scary AF to see all your value plummet the first few times.  

It doesn't help anyone to scold newbies asking about Shibonk and I'm constantly seeing shit like "well if you need your money back soon you shouldn't be investing in it". Even if that's true, there are plenty of nicer ways to say it and we don't need to be driving away newbies who will ultimately help grow the market. We are all in this together, that is the whole point of decentralized finance.

Has anyone ever been able to process a security reset on [Gate.io](https://Gate.io) in order to get your Google Authenticator disabled?  I lost access to my authenticator and have tried everything under the sun but can't get this company to disable it.  They sent me a link to a security reset page but anytime I input and submit I get an error (tried multiple browsers, multiple file format for uploaded images, everything).  I send e-mails to them but they either don't respond or they just send me the security reset link again.  I have reached out to them on twitter and get the same response.  They don't actually use their chat box and there is no phone number.  I know this isn't coinbase we're dealing with here, but damn I thought they'd have some way to help out.  If anyone has any way I can get help from that company I am begging for tips

Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I really need help.

My mother recently was scammed a large amount in Bitcoin over a span of 1 month+ (through 2 separate phishing investment/trading websites) and we only found out a few days ago, we have already approached the police and have been told it may be impossible to recover since this is an international transaction - I've read many cases where people were able to recover their funds, and I would like to do everything I can to try to trace the transactions or track this guy down. But I'm a bit lost as to how to trace their wallet (they have been telling her to send them BTC to different addresses as well - these addresses were very evidently proxy/temporary address bc they immediately moved the funds after receiving them).  

Where can I trace the addresses with more detailed information and how do I know where their wallet is or who it belongs to? I would really appreciate any guidance I can get right now.  

To get into details, she went online on her own about a month ago to try to learn stock/crypto trading, she never once told any of our family members (breaks my heart) and was fooled into funding more and more money to the scammers. These websites mentioned are [galaxytrade.cc](http://galaxytrade.cc/) and [investcore.pro](http://investcore.pro/): I've tried to look them up on whois, but it seems like they covered that part pretty well also. 

Again, I would really appreciate any guidance I can get on this. I dont expect that we would be able to get the funds, but any bit of help is really important so I can do everything I can to help my mother recover from this.  I thank you for your time &lt;3

I wrote a [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rc2mpg/its_2034/) the other day about a fantasy day in the year 2034 imagining how a widespread blockchain adoption would look like, citing a couple of blockchain applications and people treated the scenarios like a dystopian future.

Do you even want a decentralized trustless future?

Do you want blockchains to have real world applications? I cited insurance, mortgage, job signing contracts, oracles, decentralized news aggregators, medical research, voting, defi and that seemed to freak people out.

Do you even realize what the coins you invest in are promising to do once successful/finished?

Just a real question towards the community

Hi r/CryptoCurrency,  


So I've been looking through Tether's Transparency section \[[https://wallet.tether.to/transparency](https://wallet.tether.to/transparency)\], and I have noticed liabilities include ETH.

Liabilities (USD in Circulation on Eth)  
**Total Authorized** $37,828,710,009.87  
**Less: Authorized but not issued** \- $1,749,714,996.28 

Does this mean that if Tether *is* backed by Evergrande Commercial paper causing a Tether 'Bank Run' \[[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankrun.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankrun.asp)\], ETH will lose \~ 35 Billion of value?  


This question also applies to the other liabilities on Tron, Algorand etc.

The media and bi/mi/tri-lionares everywhere are FUD-ing crypto saying the classic "it's going to 0". We all know that damn well.

But remember that time in recent history when an asset really went to 0 (and tehnically below)? It was one of the most popular, manipulated and an investment that most people speculated it will go up just because big and well-developed countries were trying to acquire and buy huge amounts of it. You guessed it! OIL.

Back then the media were literally screwing with everybody "BUY OIL BUY OIL BUY OIL, YOU ARE LITERALLY GETTING PAID TO BUY OIL, JUST BUY IT, IT IS ALREADY DIRT CHEAP!". What they weren't actually telling you is that they and the people above them were (most probably) deep in red on OIL, so they were, for probably the first time in history, asking for YOUR HELP to raise its price by buying. You, the one they make fun of by manipulating nearly every investment in existence, every minute of your investing career, were asked to help them. 

Also, remember that youtube ad about investing in OIL, created by brokerage firm Etoro? Maybe I'm diving way too deep into the OIL case so I will adjust my tinfoil hat. Why OIL out of all the investments? OIL is the most manipulated and (in my opinion) a bad investment for the long term because, just like FIAT, it is owned in huge amounts by well developed countries which accumulated a large amount over hundreds of years.

As a conclusion, always do the opposite of what the media says. They don't want what is good for you, neither do rich people because if everybody is rich, then who will they work to death? 

*Crypto to infinity and beyond!*

Looking forward to everyone's comments!

**Disclaimer - I don't want to shill Doge and I don't own any Doge, I just want to clarify a few misconceptions.**  


Today's top post claimed that Doge likely has no future and could be a dead project.  
His assumtion was based on:  
 

&gt;*...over the past month, DOGE has continued to fall - it's down 32.3% in the past 30 days, 20.4% in the past two weeks and 16.1% in the past seven days.*

The whole Crypto market was going down, memecoins tend to be extra volatile. Those numbers are nothing out of the ordinary for memecoins. If you are a long-term hodler you will often see these kind of price jumps/crashes on memecoins.

   


&gt;*Yes, DOGE has been here almost since the beginning, but Elon clearly fucked public perception with his misguided 'Hustle' comment on SNL and a LOT of attention and momentum has since turned to SHIB instead, as well as other shitcoins like FLOKI, etc, etc.*

Elon Musk did shill Doge, still Doge was a quite popular project even before his shill.  
Doge cleared the path for memecoins and brought new kinds of investors to Crypto.  
The focus/hype on a coin changes frequently.   
The hype for other memecoins will fade away and if these projects manage to stay alive long-term, the hype will return again someday.  
By the way, Investors switching to other coins are like people switching traffic lanes and usually end up on the slower lane.   


 

&gt;*I'm not a current DOGE holder, but given that the coin is now well out of the Top Ten (supplanted by LUNA), is it time to admit that DOGE has finally had it's day?*

 People really believe rank #11 out of over 13 000 coins and dozens of Tokens is bad? LMAO  
There were tons of projects who entered top 10 and dropped down to the oblivion in matter of a few weeks. Doge stayed relevant since creation (2013).  
Staying relevant over long term is what truly matters IMO, that's why Bitcoin and Ethereum are great projects as well.  


Yes Doge has many flaws, but the topics OP mentioned are not relevant to determine if a project has no future or if it's dead..

Interesting article from the Financial Times about Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) feeling competition, the discount to NAV, and future path forward.

Many in the US use GBTC (Or ETHE) as one of the few ways to purchase cryptocurrency in their IRA's. It'll be interesting if Fidelity or another large player is able to get an ETF on the market that will be a direct buy of Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another.

Just half a year ago, wsb had around 8million subs, while cc had 2. Now it's 11 million compared to 4 million, showing crypto is catching up at a rapid speed to stock's popularity. Large portion of that migration might be due to realization that it will be harder and harder to pull off GME and I think we're lately seeing more and more people who use both subs. 

If that happens I think it's possible TradFi might need to tokenize stocks so that people can use the same wallets for crypto and stocks, though that process I imagine would take at least a decade to fully transfer stocks, so after some brutal regulatory fights the outcome might be that stocks will be allowed both on blockchain and on paper.  What do you think?

 One of the things that the recent events (call it crash or dip or anything that you are comfortable with) showed us was that no one really knows anything about this market.

This whole YouTube, instagram influencer crypto contents are for entertainment. Don't take them too seriously and take them with a spoon of salt. (a grain might no be enough)

Specifically be careful of those who use click-bait phrases like 10x, 100x. Or phrases like this coin will make you a millionaire in 2022. Or those who use exaggerated face expressions on thumbnails.

If you ever needed analytical videos which gives you basics on trading, Benjamin Cowen has good videos that can be helpful. He doesn't promise that you will be a millionaire if you buy a shitcoin that he probably got paid to promote.

Most importantly DYOR and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

By that I mean you invested some small amount in a coin that rose 1,000,000% or something ridiculous, and you made hundreds of thousands or millions?

The reason Im asking is because I just think itd be interesting to hear about the moment you realized, holy shit Im about to be a millionaire. 

Was it pure luck or did you actually invest in something like dogcoin because you believed in it?

I also tried searching the sub for old threads along those lines. The dogcoin just rose 500,000% and Im a millionaire threads.

&amp;#x200B;

Buy the dip, yolo, dyor.  Hope you guys are hodling strong through this dip and picking up some solid coins

Just wanted to share with you a part of my financial story in the crypto universe.

For a while now, I kept chasing low/medium cap altcoins, and I was actually pretty successful because I took into account the fundamentals and key points of those projects. NEAR, ATOM, OSMO, ALGO, etc. all helped me with enlarging my tiny bag.

My first ever investment in crypto was ETH, back in the $1200 days (I think). I put $4 and it went to $5. I remember how happy I was about it.

But then I started to dislike CEXes and tried to learn about decentralized exchanges and wallets.

Messed around and lost lots of my ETH to gas fees trying to experiment new things. At some point I thought to myself "guess DeFi is only for the rich after all".

So these newer, cheaper blockchains were really helpful with fixing my attitude towards DeFi.

But recently I decided to actually diversify and stabilize my portfolio a bit as a student. So I bought some Google stocks, because I believe in the future of the company.

My other purchase is ETH. It's going to be (and remain) a part of my portfolio, forever. It's not like anything about gas fees or anything really changed, and I wish we always have that constructive criticism in our debates. But ETH is (to me) the only altcoin which doesn't deserve the title "altcoin" anymore. It should be Bitcoin, Ethereum, and then altcoins.

The volatility is often lower than low-cap projects and it's the birthplace of DeFi, so Ethereum will always be one of my top choices - guess there's no escaping you!

# What is dust:

If you use cryptocurrency to trade or transact, you probably have dust. Dust is simply a trace amount of cryptocurrency thats leftover after a trade or transaction. It typically has negligible monetary value, ranging from minuscule fractions of a penny to a few dollars. In the crypto world, dust is a byproduct of numerous trades and transactions and is found on most blockchains.   


#  Is Crypto Dust Bad?

Crypto dust isnt bad  its just a small byproduct of using a blockchain-based payment network. Youll see dust not only when you transact, but when you trade as well. This typically happens when you try to trade all of one asset for another. If you trade all your ether (ETH) for Bitcoin, you cant get it converted exactly to eight decimal places  theres usually a small amount leftover. This is the dust. There is no rounding. Therefore, youll have dust in your exchange accounts as well. Some exchanges will give you credit for this leftover dust. If they do, it is commonly credited to you in the specific exchange's native currency. As an incentive to use that exchange,even though the dust may not add up to much. If you dont get credited for the dust, you probably dont need to panic about losing less than a penny's worth of a cryptocurrency.  


Dusting is not something most crypto holders should be concerned about, but its a good idea to know what those small amounts in your wallet are and how they accumulate.  


# What Is a Cryptocurrency Dusting Attack?

A dusting attack is an attack in which a trace amount of crypto, called dust, is sent to thousands  sometimes even hundreds of thousands  of wallet addresses. This attack is deployed in order to track these addresses with the hope of un-masking or de-anonymizing them. Dust is found on most public blockchains, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Dogecoin, among others.   


 In October 2020, scammers started performing a new kind of dusting attack on the Binance Chain (BC). They sent tiny amounts of BNB to multiple addresses, leaving a link to a malicious website in the transaction Memo. Be careful! This is a scam. There is no BNB to be claimed.  


Recently i've been hearing about people receiving a really big amount of some unknown crypto worth tens of thousands of dollars, however once you try to move these funds, they will slowly bleed your wallet dry and you'll be left with nothing.  
I'm not sure if I can count this as dusting as it's not with small amount, but it's something to be aware of as well.  
If you receive a big amount, just don't touch it or you'll probably lose every other asset in your wallet.  


TLDR:

Crypto dust is a miniscule amount of crypto that's leftover from a trade or transaction.  
A dusting attack is an effort to unmask or de-anonymizing your adress

 If you have small amounts of crypto dust gathering dust in your wallet, don't worry about it, just don't touch it to be sure.

  
If you've received a big amount of an unknown crypto, definitely don't touch it!

Hi,

I just (very stupidly) got scammed for almost all my ETH. I use coinbase. I realized as soon as I sent the ETH that it was a scam and clicked 'cancel' what felt like 100 times after logging in and out with no success. I am not sure if it's possible to cancel transactions once they are confirmed, but I am curious where the 'cancel' button even exists if that is the case.

Is there anything I can do? I know that coinbase is insured but IDK if it's insured for human error. I have all the data I could have on this.

The scammer is messaging me asking for the ID of the transaction? Is there a chance that he can't complete the scam until his has this?

some context on what hes asking for:

[https://gyazo.com/db4b7ecc8ab56768e8f1376a3f888cd9](https://gyazo.com/db4b7ecc8ab56768e8f1376a3f888cd9)

why would he need this? Does this mean there is a chance I can get it back?

Gala Games is holding their event announcing some supposedly big news over the weekend. They are an experienced developer of casual games, with solid projects already shipped and several new ones in the pipeline. They have a co-founder of Zynga on board, received $100m in funding from Binance alone this July. 

You might want to look out for some strong price action in the next few days.

How I made money without leaving home, even before the pandemic, or my path as a trader.

Sorry in advance for my english 

  Hello everyone, today I want to tell my story about the successful success of hard and hard work and sleepless nights. I'll start with the fact that I am trader (not an investor) with more than 4x experience years and no, I do not have a lambo or 1m$. I knew about trading for a long time, but the beginning was always stopped by the difficulty of opening an account with a broker and the required minimum capital of which I did not have (I was still an unemployed student). It all started with the fact that I graduated from the institute and in the last years I had more free time and I delved into sports with specific goals (to succeed in it) in parallel trying to start my own small online business. After a while, I began to succeed in sports, after 5 months it was planned to participate in competitions, but at the next training session I overdid it and got injured, followed by an operation and a complete ban on doing this sport (later I continued to do it, but at an amateur level). But this event knocked me down a little. While I was recovering from the injury, I did not know what to do with myself, and now I remembered about trading, and then the crypto boom of 2017 just started, a lot of useless information from everywhere, from every chat, group, public, they were all crypto traders selling courses (in which they They did not understand anything and gave useful knowledge 0), sold signals, talked about a new shitcoin that will give 100000x by the new year and stuff like that. In the end, I bought in, hoping to make 1,000,000$ in 5-6 months with 300$). But I bought not for training or signals, but for easy entry and low entry cost (you could start trading on the exchange at least 10$, I started with the Poloniex exchange. I entered 40$ on the exchange for training and education, I read a couple of useless books (there was no one to find out the correct and useful information and I started googling.) Later I decided that I knew everything, 100,500 indicators + advice from the chat and I bought a couple of altcoins, I didn't have to wait long after a couple of months and many attempts to buy at the bottom and average my 40$ turned into 10 + -. (as you already understood the dreams of 1,000,000$ dissipated by themselves and I realized that I needed to work more on myself and learn). I realized that I don't know something, I read a couple more books, read the opinions of "cryptanalysts and gurus", heard advice to change the exchange (while the BTC-E exchange had problems). I switched to Bitfinex, brought 300$ there and then the worst thing happened that could happen to a trader at the start my career started to work out (I got into a bullish trend) in two months my 300$ turned into 1000$ (there was no limit to my happiness and joy, the mathematics in my head was simple and according to my calculations I would make a million in less than a year). But here is the winter of 2018 (who does not know then the crypt began to fall strongly and became very volatile) after 4 months my deposit decreased to 8$. I took a break for a couple of months, started working and at the same time looking for the correct information regarding trading (even at that time there was a lot of information, but how to find out if it was worthy of attention was not clear (I will say right away, from my own experience I learned that: to understand useful this knowledge or not, you need to already have the necessary information.) And so I learned about scalping, after reading many books and watching all the possible videos on YouTube about it (I will say that 95% turned out to be useless), I switched to practice. knowledge to go to practice was my best decision (the rule of 20% theory and 80% worked). I quit my job and devoted all my time to practice (I slept for 5 hours and spent the rest of the time at the charts.) I realized that patterns or indicators should not work, but a trader.A month later I switched to Bitmex (due to low commissions like 0.02%, and on Bitfinex it was 0.2%, for a scalper the size of the commission is very important) started 1000 $ and I started to make money, but not about what x100 and speech n That was (I said goodbye to this illusion long ago), I set for myself a risk of 2% for a day, 6% for a week and 12% for a month. Oh, and it was difficult to adhere to it, I would say unrealistic (the risk is very difficult to observe with a small deposit, since you always want to earn more). I started making money, although not every day (according to statistics, about a third of the working month are unprofitable or 0 days). In the first year of successful work, I concentrated on growing my small deposit. In 2020, I switched to work for a larger exchange. After being ill with Covid, at first I was more tired and could not be focused for a long time. I made the decision not to work late, do more health (sports), spend time with my family, and in fact, this affected my work for the better. Now I am more focused on the quality of transactions, rather than their number (Pareto principle and everything like that).
To everyone who has just started or wants to start their path in trading, I want to wish to think more with your head and practice (levels, tape, your patterns and no signals or indicators) more patience and, if possible, cool mentors. and remember that "Time spent has nothing to do with job done."

## Highlights

* **Mysterious Mongoose coin has already zoomed up by 110,000% over the 24 hours.**
* **At the time of writing, it was trading at US$$0.01591 with a 24-hour volume of US$1,100,000.** 

Mongoose coin crypto didn't exist a couple of days back. Things started at the hearing of the US House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday, 8 December, when Rep. Brad Sherman spoke about the possibility of a Mongoose Coin ruling the crypto market in near future on a lighter note. The news of a possible new crypto token spread like a wildfire among Twitterati and crypto enthusiasts.

The fun started when someone went ahead and created the Mongoose coin. As per the latest figures from DEX Screener, the coin has already zoomed up by 110,000% over the 24 hours. **At the time of writing, it was trading at US$$0.01591 with a 24-hour volume of US$1,100,000. It has a live market cap of US$660,0000 with a total supply of 69,420,000 MONG coins.**

**Created out of a Congressional hearing**

During the hearing, Rep. Sherman said that the biggest threat to cryptocurrencies is crypto itself. He said that the threat is the Bitcoin can be replaced by Ether, which can again be replaced by Dogecoin or Hamster coin and so on. He then asked that amid all this frenzy, what could a Mongoose Coin do?

In a short while, someone launched the token, which led the Twitter world abuzz followed up by the token's significant spike. The Twitterati couldn't stop talking about the new coin. Following this, not only just Mongoose coins value appreciated, but the likes of Hamster Coin also saw a significant jump following Sherman's speech. **Hamster coin was up by 67% and was trading at US$0.00000002431, with a 24-hour trading volume of US$3,129,481.**

**Is it a scam?**

The sudden resurgence of a coin that was created overnight seems to be a case of pump and dump. It is not that the meme-based coins haven't done well in the past. One can never forget about Dogecoin, which is one of the top 20 cryptos per market cap at present.

But the overnight popularity of the Mongoose coin, without any significant backing, has created doubts among investors. After all, it doesn't have a website, social media profile so far, and such a significant rise without it being listed on any exchange is indeed surprising. The experts also believe that it would be better to ensure that it's not a case of another Squid Games.

Only time will tell if it's another scam or not, but at present it is enjoying the glory and grabbed many eyeballs.

That's assuming you have opened your vault and are participating in the sub. By doing both, you could receive moons, which is a real cryptocurrency.  I'm using DCA as a word for "getting more crypto". 

&amp;#x200B;

As a person from a less privileged country, I really don't have much fiat to throw at my portfolio and DCA into the projects I believe in. But moons have helped me with that. I don't have much money but moons enable me to DCA into crypto, all while doing what I love, talking about crypto! I talk a lot about DCA, but most of my DCA have actually come from free crypto streams.

&amp;#x200B;

You don't need money to get started into crypto, all you need are a bit of time.

Here is everything that I personally did/doing to earn crypto.

\-Participating in other forums that reward crypto (donuts).

\-Through CoinBase Earn, Earn crypto by learning projects

\-Using projects that give out Crypto (Like Brave Browser, ad free fa\*\*ing and you earn crypto).

\-Using a crypto faucet (usually very tiny).

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to comment more that I could do Hopefully I have convinced some people who might want to start on crypto but have no money.

I am just curious how cryptocurrency ranks for you as an election issue. Many voters vote for specific candidates or political parties based on single issues. It isnt terribly clear to me that the topic of cryptocurrencies or regulations related to crypto is aligned with any specific political party. Perhaps more on a candidate level. If a candidate doesnt align with any of your other values, but seems pro-crypto, what do you do? I am aware of the forum where I am posting this, but am curious where crypto falls in the list of values and criteria you have for determining how you ultimately vote.

We are all here because we love crypto. We all like green candles, seeing banks get rekt and government printers getting paper stuck. We cherish our crypto through volatile market, through the battlefield where fudders are shooting at us from every direction. We endur because we believe in the investments we hold.  

But dont forget about yourself.

When you get stressed its hard to unglue yourself from the charts, news, reddit even.. But it's in such times the best thing you can do for yourself is to  keep yourself away from the market for a while.

Im not saying that you need to go to Tibet and become a hermit. Feel free to be aware of the market data, but not so aware that you're emotionally reacting to every gain and loss. Such state of mind will lead you to hasty and often poor decisions. 


Take a walk, leave your house, get away from your everyday. Eat something healthy, it does wonders to body and mind. Drink water not soft drinks or alcohol.
Distance will give you perspective and when you return youll feel revitalized. 

Take care of your body and mind. Its single most important investment you have.

There is a quickly rising post right now saying that we aren't early anymore because Bitcoin and Ethereum have gone main stream. We may not be early for the top 2 coins anymore (although IMHO they will still grow at insane rates over the next 10 years) but the cryptosphere is constantly evolving and there are TONS of opportunities to get in early on solid projects. However, the key is you have to be planning long term and not trying to chase last minute pumps.

These sort of opportunities tend to come in waves, but right now I would say the two main, reasonably low risk investments are centered around polkadot parachains or Cardano defi. Let me give an example.

Everyone rags on Cardano for being slow to get shit done, and many FUDing it as vaporware. But at the moment there is a defi exchange on testnet (Sundaeswap) that anyone can access with the right wallet and some test coins.

You may recall awhile ago when Uniswap airdropped like 400 tokens each to early users of the platform. Currently, that airdrop is worth about 8,000 USD, and was over 16000 at the recent ATH.

Now, I have no idea if Sundaeswap will do anything similar, but you bet your ass I figured out which wallet I needed and started messing around with testnet coins just in case. And at this point it's a numbers game. I also have been messing around on Ergodex and just got in on an airdrop list for AnetaBTC, a governance coin for wrapped BTC for defi on ADA.

All of these projects could fail miserably, and maybe ADA will be dead before the next bull run (I highly doubt it, but sure). But getting in early means taking a risk and thinking outside the box of what is being Shilled on this sub or on Twitter. Figuring out how to get testnet coins and trialling defi platforms is definitely something that means, by definition, you will be early.

Anyways, just my two cents.

TLDR, we are still early in Crypto, but taking advantage of that means leaving this sub and thinking outside the box.

If you had $15K in cash or the same amount in crypto, would you use either to start your own mining operation?  If the value was in coins, let's assume you'd have to cash all of it out first to buy the equipment.

This is something I've started pondering lately.  If everyone assumes the value of a selected coin is going to go up in time, would it be better to liquidate what you have to and start over with mining or do you keep the status quo since you already have $15K? 

And, yes, I know there are other options you could choose to use your $15K but this is limited to mining for now for this hypothetical situation.

Hey guys. After trying to purchase a gpu for almost year and half for schooling (CAD/CAM). Ive come to realize camping outside bestbuy / refreshing web pages in hopes of finding one is not worth it. Im leaning towards spending extra for a scalped card. I was curious to know how much you guys make in a day mining with a RTX 3060ti / 3070ti / 3080ti? Is it worth buying this card at a scalped price and earning it back mining? I would be mining on a gaming focused pc not a dedicated mining rig. Thanks for any tips and or advice.

My Elevator pitch for AMP

1. Unique purpose. AMP (on Flexas network) is a merchant payment network and the most logical option for retailers. Instant transactions, and an already established and reliable team making long term efforts 
2. Actual reason for use. Amp cuts out the middle man found from debit card companies. Large companies could save as much as 5 billion dollars a year (assuming amp is used as much as visa). A big problem with Crypto payments is the processing time which can last as long as 30 minutes, although AMP will cover any errors with the staked coins used as a collateral 
3. A chance to get in early! Amp has only been around for a little over a year
4. Real world use. You can already use AMP on the SPEDN app

But dont listen to a random guy on the internet! Check out the Whitepaper

Good luck!

*disclaimer: I am a crypto enthusiast.*

Sticking to r/cc, reading and absorbing every news in this sub, I came across a comment which mentioned that *xyz* comment should belong to 'r/buttcoin'. Prior to that, I had not heard of this sub.

Out of curiosity, I went to r/buttcoin and started understanding the articles.

To my dismay, most of these 'hot topics' discussed there are crypto-relevant and what we are also currently discussing as actual issues for crypto adoption. These posts range from [Mining is harmful](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/r151rh/europe_must_ban_bitcoin_mining_to_hit_the_15c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) *(that's why most of us are moving to PoS)*, [Tether scare](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/r7vkbi/tether_an_8_person_company_based_in_virgin_isles/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [Celsius USDT loans](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/r1ubtc/celsius_ponzi_scam_announces_the_need_to_raise/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [CEX problems](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/r98vi0/crypto_exchange_bitmart_confirms_hack_resulting/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [investing more than you can afford](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/rc86rm/peak_dunning_kruger_itt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to [memecoin utility stuff](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/na9nou/shitcoin_pumpdump_is_becoming_ingrained_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). **We all recognize these issues and warn newbies joining our** r/cc\*\*, regularly.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

**But here's the real kicker:** The discussion themes of r/buttcoin are changing from being crypto-naysayers to what is actually plaguing crypto adoption. Let's take few example posts in that sub changing over time:

* Posts from few years ago:
   * [Ridiculing BTC from 4 years ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/85pg4x/debating_bitcoin/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)
   * [Crypto volatility](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/7v99ad/just_checked_my_bank_account_in_panic_had_9000_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)
   * [Seeing adoption failures as their victory](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/a97lre/who_likes_turkey_anyway_ramen_three_times_a_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)
* Posts from recent months:
   * [Recognizing that Gold buyers are moving to crypto](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/lgd58q/btc_is_stealing_revenue_from_gold_miners/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)
   * [Lack of stablecoin regulation](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/odmue5/gaping_hole_in_us_stablecoin_regulation_circle/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)
   * [Narrow Adoption](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/nlo79a/are_we_living_in_the_future_bought_snacks_with_usd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (I guess he/she isn't aware of the El Salvador news yet)
   * [Hacking exploit BadgerDAO](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/r7mfec/celsiusmashinsky_lose_900_btc_from_badgerdao/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

The shift of critiques from blatantly refusing btc to bringing up the real issues in crypto indicates that crypto is indeed inevitable! its adoption is only a matter of time...

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: r/buttcoin discussion themes have changed from 'Crypto-bad' to actual problems in crypto space. Makes me bullish!

Hey everyone,

Im not a member of their team, but Disney animator and well-known artist, Kurtis Dawe, has just created an NFT project called Prime Apes Planet. (Kurtis Dawe has worked on films like The Lion King, Godzilla and many other animations for Marvel, Disney, and MGM)

Whats awesome is that all Prime Ape collectibles will be ready for use in the MetaVerse. This means that the models are equipped to be used in movies, games, meet-ups in the Metaverse!

His team consists of successful entrepreneurs, celebrities, experienced artists and marketing veterans to drop this collection at the end of December 2021.

Let me know what you think!

Trading interfaces like Binance have simple 2D graphs and a few simple models. I'm wondering if there is any super 3D or VR interfaces. I can imagine fantastic possibilities, especially if you can add your own models/programs and flags to text your mobile, etc.

I could really see value for this type of advanced interface. Being able to visualize patterns leads to insights into better models. A 3D or VR interface allows you to perform and view more interesting functions. It could also look fantastic and just be fun to use.

Here's a first idea; what about a Blender3D 'Cryptoview' addon. That would be awesome. All you would need is fast-ish access to trading data. Have an export to Unity and run it in real time. I think the possibilities are endless.

Take a long hard look at the assets you're choosing to "HODL". If you're purchasing meme coins to HODL, maybe you should rethink that strategy. Did Doge happen to re-emerge at a much higher price? Sure. That was an anomaly. Meme coins crash and burn. The only reason Doge became relevant again is because of comments made by the richest man on earth, Elon Musk. Had it not been for him and the meme community, Doge would still be where it was (dying a slow and painful death). 

Right now in this current downtrend, it's a great time to start thinking about long term goals. These prices are also decent buy-ins, IMO. Start assessing which projects are going to survive over the next 10-20 years.

Projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum have the highest chances of survivability and will probably stick around. You may say, "but I can't afford ETH or BTC." It doesn't matter. Read up on what DCA is. Every extra penny will help you reach financial freedom. 

This is just the ramblings of someone who has been through several crypto winters. Take what you will.

Hey guys!  
I've been hearing for years that reddit is the capital for crypto-enthusiasts and decided to join.   
I'm in the business of developing a cutting-edge blockchain project. Every day our team faces the real challenges of creating a unique technical and graphical infrastructure, as well as creating a scientific and legal model for integrating digital assets into the international economy (a daunting task and as it turns out, solvable).

# I found it interesting to discuss the most basic but important topic: "HOW do you imagine the future of cryptocurrency?".

Just please don't write answers like "Bitcoin at 100k or a million". I am interested in a scientific and analytical approach that includes arguments and facts, especially if you are involved in crypto project development, a lawyer or an economist.

**I will share my opinion** (and I will wait for yours in response):  
In my mind, the major achievement of the entire industry is the emergence and popularization of Blockchain technology.   
It has the very big ranges of applications that are still undiscovered and not understood by most people. This situation is similar with every technology in the beginning of its existence, like the Internet in the 90's, who needed it at all, but now everybody needs it)))

**As of today, we have two historical developments:**

1 - the emergence of blockchain.  
2 - the addition of smart contracts to the blockchain  
3 - further there are attempts of application: e.g. CBDC, DEFI or NFT.   
It 3 item says "attempts" because they have a fairly limited audience reach, a high entry threshold (most often a terribly complex ux) and no ability to spread into society.

**What prevents them from spreading normally? The lack of legal regulation of the industry!** 

Now the entire cryptocurrency industry amounts to about $3 trillion, which is "a drop in the ocean" compared to the market prospects. That said, big part of of the capitalization is simply fake, as many bitcoins worth hundreds of millions of dollars are lost, and hundreds of millions more are imitate by scam projects.

**I believe that real success will come when governments write laws for the industry. But how are they going to do that if they lack two key aspects:**

1- Willingness to innovate.

2- Competencies in technology, law, economics and visionary. Such a set of competencies is only possible in private companies.

Hence, the big question is "how long to wait for the necessary laws?" I think 5 years, and until then we will be playing in the sandbox.

Also in my opinion cryptocurrency and its existing forms are just the first stage of blockchain application. In what follows I will refer to cryptocurrency and all its varieties as "tokens."

**What is a blockchain token: it is a unit of record of right of ownership of an asset.** 

In the case of Bitcoin, everyone is interested in the right to get fiat currency (e.g. US dollars), for nft it is the ownership of a digital art object.  


&gt;So in the future, any physical and virtual asset can be digitized and turned into a blockchain token. This will create a decentralized database that stores all the assets available to the global economy. It is a completely different world: fast, transparent and convenient.

The benefits to the local and international payments industry are obvious.   
In addition, you will be able to An apartment will be able to be digitized and, if necessary, divided into parts by room, so that each can be rented out separately.   
The creative professions would be able to digitize each of their products into a token and sell, whoever has the token has the right to use the song or image.   
Even the creation of sites will be built on tokens, which will allow you to use someone else's content on your site, but without a token impose restrictions on the site.   
Eat at one restaurant, get a bonus for the bill, and go to any other restaurant to spend bonus. 

It's hard to imagine all the possibilities of using tokens legally.

But as I said before "without the necessary laws there won't be such a perfect world" because most of the conveniences are related to legal companies and government registries that are subject to accounting and tax laws, which in the real world do not accept cryptocurrency.

P.S. I know about the example of El Salvador. But that's an isolated case, it's not enough. There needs to be acceptance from the world's leading states.

I could write many more thoughts about the state of the industry and **how to really speed up the process of integrating blockchain into the economy**, but I think there is enough information written to begin the discussion. 

Perhaps someone disagrees with me and thinks the industry should evolve differently. It would be interesting to hear your opinion.

*P.S. In the future I would like to discuss more regulation, the current tasks before the developers of the projects today, the prospects and possibilities of the technology, the latest news events and perhaps share with you the methodology of how we are going to integrate the token of our system into the economy (but this is sometime).*  
*If you are interested in discussing the above topics, then subscribe to my page, like, repost (or as is the custom here, I have yet to figure it out) )).*

There is a lot of focus in the crypto space on NFTs as art. Only a small percentage of the general public is aware that NFTs can be used for purposes other than proving ownership of a gif or image. It is expected that in the near future, NFTs would be used to solve common difficulties in industry.

The following are my own top three NFT applications:  
**1. Unique Experiences**

Some industries are using NFTs to tokenize historic moments. I recently came across a project called [Technorats ](https://technorats.io/) that captures nocturnal explorations through a macbook keyboard that isnt controlled by a human. Real animals run the algorithm while taking selfies, which is mind blowing. I think this is the most unique project that I have come across. 

**2. Event Ticketing**

Using unique, unforgeable NFTs to represent tickets for specific sports and entertainment events helps to prevent scalping and scamming. [**Smart contracts**](https://blog.makerdao.com/how-ethereum-smart-contracts-power-dai-the-maker-protocol-and-defi/) can be used to make tickets non-transferable to prevent scalpers from purchasing sought-after tickets in bulk and then reselling them at inflated prices and prevent scammers from trying to sell counterfeit tickets.

On a podcast in March, Mark Cuban, billionaire investor and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, expressed a great deal of interest in NFT technology. Were trying to find a good option for turning our tickets into NFTs. We want to be able to find ways so that not only can our consumers, our fans, buy tickets and resell them, but we continue to make a royalty on them.

**3. The Music and Video Industry**

In much the same way [**NFTs have helped artists discover new ways to create their works and reach new markets**](https://blog.makerdao.com/decentralized-stable-crypto-tokens-broaden-their-appeal-to-the-digital-artwork-market/), the tokens are also transforming how musicians create and share their music and videos.

The properties of NFTsuniqueness, verifiability, transferabilityoffer musicians greater independence from labels and other gatekeepers of their industry, better enabling them to self-distribute their work and cultivate direct relationships with fans. Musicians can sell tracks as NFTs on marketplaces such as OpenSea, auction previously unpublished material as limited-release NFTs, and even sell rights to their works.

Beyond art, what is your favorite application of NFTs?

So back in January when I went all in on crypto. I was legit feeling the euphoria , I doubled my money in 3 months and felt glorious. My gut told me to take profits but I got greedy and rode my profits all the way down to the crash that happened in May. I got wrecked bad and didnt know what to do so I held my losses for 4 months till crypto was going bullish again. I was doing research about the bitcoin cycle chart and the blow off top would be in The beginning weeks of November based on the chart and this is where I should be trimming profits . But guess what? I didnt because Twitter and social media made me believe that we were going to hit new all time highs and I got interested and held all my positions. Moral of the story, stick to your plan. I was going to scale out all of my positions because I was worried that the global world reopening would mean people would be less interested meaning  less money in the crypto space.

So this idea came to me. I thought it would be interesting to see what are some of this communities best and worst FOMO decisions for this run so far. This is more for coins you didnt get in early on and FOMOd in at some point. 

My best FOMO was into Solana at 40$. I almost didnt do it and kept telling myself it had already topped. Well that turned out to be a great decision.

My worst FOMO decision so far is FTM. I bought into at just over 2$ on the dip from its ATH. That decision has not done well for me.

Fiat can be printed to infinity at the expense of the people that hold it by just a few people in power. Especially when the media wants people to still believe that "inflation is transitory" when there haven't been any notable long-term deflation for centuries.

This is especially true when you give the central bank full power over all monetary policies. When only a few people have power, they will do everything they can to keep the status quo.

The only currency that you can currently buy controlled by the people is crypto. Crypto can't be bought out of thin air, ever. It is a pure democracy because You need 51% of the network no matter what, and it can't be manipulated or confiscated.

TLDR: No matter how powerful you are, the regular people control crypto. Bankers hate people being in control of their own money. This is why they hate crypto because they know crypto has brought democracy to finance.

I've been wondering about this for a few days... I know that market always connects buyers and sellers and everyone has a price they're willing to buy or sell their BTC...but am really wondering what is the maximum price a Bitcoin could ever reach.

In the long run, if we assume mass adoption and BTC still King, with holders being diluted, the market fully stabilized, people receiving their wages in BTC etc..... How high could it ever go?

Thanks a lot for your inputs and sorry if this is a stupid question.

Title says it all, but this is sort of a follow up to an earlier post I did asking about why people stopped investing in Crypto. I thought it be interesting to see what got people to mostly, if not entirely, get out of the market. 

Im not expecting you to tell net worth or anything, you can speak generally or in percentages, whatever you are comfortable with. Im just curious what the factors/parameters were for alright, Im good, or conversely, Ive lost enough, Im done. I see a lot of chest pounding and people yelling about diamond hands, but Im definitely one of those people who fall under the mentality of pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered, though Im obviously still in the game at present lol. 

Anyway thanks for your insight. Just thought it would be an interesting discussion.

While you need to be really lucky, it is possible (not guaranteed) to make a lot of money by day trading crypto.

Every day there are coins that jump 10x, 100x.

OK, they are all outside of the top 500 at least and most are very short on project details, team credentials etc. but they happen every day.

One of the mantras of this sub is to *DCA and HODL*. We have all seen it in the comments of every post.

While it will vary from person to person but I am wondering what you all consider to be "long term" to hold any crypto.

I do not think I have a legitimate view on this as I have not been here even 6 months yet.

Looking at the fundamentals and tokenomics of MOVE, this token seems uniquely qualified to become massively popular. Its a legit token which provides a needed service (its not a shitcoin), it doesnt have a huge circulation and is hyper deflationary, holders get reflections, and the dev team is top notch. Seeing as how some useless coins like SHIB have taken off, I cant imagine this NOT catching on fire once it begins to be listed on major exchanges in 2022 and retail investors learn about it. The sky could be the limit on this one, and good to be in early on the bottom floor! What are your thoughts?

My father has suffered a massive heart incident, he is unconscious, and he is going to pass in the next 48 hours.

Theres a lot going on, and one of the things on my mind, being as I know he made a recent investment into the cryptocurrency space, was that his funds needed to be transferred to a manageable place before he passes. I was unsure of what type of protection he had on his coinbase account, and so naturally I need to make sure that I could still have access to his face and his thumbprint before the inevitable happens.

Before anybody says anything about grievances or anything like that, I can assure you all that this is the hardest thing that Ive ever gone through. Ive actually never lost someone very close to me, and the loss of my father is unbelievable. Just the thought of telling my children breaks me down into tears instantaneously.

So heres my question: is funds are on coin base, I just scanned the front and back of his drivers license, and got to the last part where it says perfect! Now lets take a selfie to verify that its you! 

My father has tubes in his face, and Im not sure of how Im supposed to go about doing this in order to withdraw his funds before its too late.

Any advice on what to do is greatly appreciated.

Call your loved ones, tell them that you love them, and hold onto them as quickly as you can. 

Any of you that send me private messages will not be read, and I will not be clicking any links, so please dont even try to take advantage of this terrible time in our life.

Any unbiased advice for both these projects? I did some basic research (also yt and reddit ofc) and lately have been seeing a lot of bullish news/thoughts for ALGO and MATIC. Now I want to give them a try for next year because of the long-term tech, also considering how they gained huge price actions throughout this year. Going to do some pros and cons before I buy either one but I guess one main difference is that the other an L1 blockchain and other an L2 solution? 

Would really like to know what is the better option if I could only pick one.

TL;DR: Cryptocurrencies are more than just a means of payment.

# When you think of mainstream adoption, what does it look like?

I used to picture people spending their BTC to buy groceries, perhaps using XLM as a replacement for Venmo/Cashapp, or getting their paychecks in ETH.

This leads to more questions:

* *Why would people want to spend cryptocurrency if the price is volatile?*
* *Why will people bother to set up crypto wallets, keep track of a seed phrase?*
* *What is the point of this if I'm being taxed every time I breathe?*

Yes, there is value in the way that cryptocurrency allows us to exchange money. But by asking all these questions, I believe we are missing the point.

By being overly concerned with the monetary aspect of cryptocurrency, it's like if someone walked up to you and said "I don't know how computers work, I'm just here to throw money at Microsoft stock," or "I don't care about driving places, I'm just at the gas station to buy the dip on unleaded gasoline."

# So, what's the point?

Smart-contracts, web 3.0, decentralized applications... if these terms seem meaningless to you, that's expected. Here's an excerpt from "Out of the Ether" by Matthew Leising that really made things click for me:

&gt;Think of a blockchain-based digital version of Uber, but without the middleman that is Uber taking 30 percent of every transaction. **Consumers pay less, drivers earn more, and hopefully the user experience of clicking an app on a smartphone isn't much different.**  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;What's amazing about this idea of a new kind of Internet that's peer-to-peer is that **Ethereum has money programmed into it already. Ether is the currency of the realm**, meaning that banks can't shut it down. Losing access to banking is almost always a sure way to kill off something you don't like. Here it's impossible.

Blockchains like Ethereum allow us to create an autonomous, unbiased middleman for all the complex transactions we do in our lives. **It's not just about replacing fiat, it's about** ***replacing middlemen*** **such as Uber, AirBnB, or Ebay.** When we ignore this fact, we get an inaccurate view of the reasons that blockchain technology is valuable to our society.

# How does this help if I'm only here to make money?

Spending cryptocurrency is neat, but it's mostly just a part of the honeymoon phase of crypto adoption... Governments will most likely end up creating their own if/when crypto replaces fiat. Because of this, you should focus on the real-world utility of the investments you make. In 5-10 years, that is all that will matter.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice. Peace out!

The battery just took a crap in my Google Pixel. 

Google is replacing is free of charge, I have a local authorized repair center (uBreakiFix) doing the repair, they have OEM factory authentic batteries on hand.

Phone still works, battery WAS at 100% earlier this morning but now it won't display a battery percentage and it won't charge. I'm running on borrowed time boys and girls!

Should I...

Sign out of all my wallets such as Meta, Trust, Ledger etc and pull the SIM when I get there OR just factory reset the thing completely before going and pull the SIM when I get there and just sign everything back in after the fact?

Thoughts? Suggestions?

&gt;I have abandoned Ethereum despite supporting it in the past.

&gt;"Ethereum culture suffers massively from the Founders Dilemma

&gt;Everyone is already far too rich to remember what they originally set out to do.
-CEO of Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) on Twitter


In less than three weeks following his statements, his company purchased 156,400 Ethereum, worth over half a billion U.S. Dollar

When asked about this, he answered:

&gt;bought this ETH from whoever was financially illiterate enough to sell this weekend


Remember: Someone spreading unreasonable FUD about a given Crypto, might actually only be interested to buy it cheaper, this is the best example

I am not sure if it is a progressive idea or just a stupid vision like a flying car nevertheless money and the utility it holds should be at least a social sciences topic and should be taught in elementary school. 

First of all theres almost no children without a smart phone these days... and so fort they have born into this trend most of them. So the idea of holding a digital asset is getting more and more usual with each generation. 

I know there are some legitimacy issues regarding the age barrier but I dont really think of it as a huge obstacle since the process of purchasing can be monitored by parents as how it works with the credit cards. 

... I know theres an ocean of pros/cons, dos/donts, applicables/discardables behind the idea which also requires a lot of background knowledge as well however I think sooner the better. 

I am very keen on how crypto might achieve some groundbreaking success against FIAT and even in commodity scene and what I think of is the youth should be taught about the crypto and what it is just like how Lydians discovered the idea of money. 

This is just an hypothetical idea but I really want kids and I think it would be better for children to learn about the concept as they are being taught about gold, commodities and money as well.

It should be very clear that anyone claiming to be Satoshi is just looking for fame. There was a reason for Bitcoin being made anonymously under an anonymous username.

If the real Satoshi wanted to make himself known, he'd already be having it done a long time ago. Craig Wright claiming himself to be the inventor of Bitcoin can't even prove Satoshis wallet is his despite the authorities asking him repeatedly to move even a small amount in order to prove it.

TLDR: The real Satoshi would not chase the media for attention because Satoshi created Bitcoin to save people from the greed of banks and politicians, not for personal fame.

So nearly every day I've been hearing about how CA in USA has had horrible problems with looting. Now Ebay and a few other places is complaining about how much of the stolen goods go on there.

One solution to this is crypto. Even more so something like Vechain. Right now it is a crypto meant to help track fraud in shipments and they are trying to expand that to the food market. Well in this case what could happen is 

1. Manufactures would have to somehow physically attach to the products some code or QR code or something that links that 1 physical device to the blockchain. From there put something near the bar code on the box.
2. When the product gets to the store they can scan the code on the box for each one. This logs on the blockchain that 1 physical item was in that physical store at this date and time.
3. During checkout this is scanned again and it adds to the blockchain that 1 physical item was sold during this date and time.
4. Now as an added bonus what would be interesting if there was a way the new owner can scan it or something to gain control to add (not change) info. They scan it and at this date and time it is registered to them. 
5. When they resell it they can scan it to let the blockchain know it's sold and so on. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first part of this basically lets you know if you are about to buy or have bought a stolen item. Like if you see a scan where it goes into a store but no scan for checkout. It's highly likely that was looted, and you can pick to report the person to ebay or whatever to be looked into. 

The other part is lets say part of what is added is general location info or something else. It helps the cops track down stolen goods. 

There will need to be extra features for this to really work well, but in theory this should work. Like it won't completely stop looting, but it will let honest people stay honest.

**Wrap BTC on Ergo and Cardano**

TLDR: new first decentralized wrapped btc token. Will allow for alot of money to be moving into the ERGO and Cardano chains. here is whitepaper, [https://medium.com/@anetaBTC/anetabtc-litepaper-v1-0-171f29b3276a](https://medium.com/@anetaBTC/anetabtc-litepaper-v1-0-171f29b3276a)

  
Decentralized. Trustless. On-chain. AnetaBTC, powered by Ergo. This harmonizes the free nature of BTC and DeFi to create anetaBTC, a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset, fully collateralized, and interoperable. Directly mint anetaBTC without any involvement of a third-party. No custudy, fully on-chain  guaranteed and verifiable through transparent and accessible smart contracts.

AnetaBTC is a fully on-chain, decentralized protocol that allows [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/) to be directly wrapped on the [Ergo](http://ergoplatform.org/) and [Cardano](http://cardano.org/) blockchains. AnetaBTC enables Bitcoin holders to unlock the value of their assets in a secure and efficient environment to provide yield, without selling any Bitcoin and without any third-party custodian involvement, as in the case of [wBTC](https://wbtc.network/) which is on the [Ethereum](http://ethereum.org/) blockchain and is the largest wrapped Bitcoin protocol today with over $14 billion of locked Bitcoin value.

Wrapped Bitcoin has the potential to provide the Ergo and Cardano platforms essential liquidity required for most all DeFi applications by transferring the full value of Bitcoin on a 1:1 basis  the total current market capitalization of Bitcoin exceeds $1.1 trillion, while the total value of wrapped Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain nears $20 billion.

AnetaBTC is crucial infrastructure to progress blockchain technology and decentralization  true decentralization, without any third-party intermediaries. AnetaBTC will be entirely on-chain using Ergo smart contracts and fully compatible with cross-chain decentralized exchanges on Cardano and Ergo.

In 2019, investors were introduced to the first wrapped Bitcoin product, WrappedBTC (wBTC). The creation of wBTC by [BitGo](https://www.bitgo.com/), [Kyber Network](https://kyber.network/), and [Ren](https://renproject.io/), formerly known as Republic Protocol was revolutionary in its own right, but wBTC is entirely centralized due to BitGo being the sole custodian for wBTC and this entity, partly owned by Goldman Sachs, has full legal control of all locked Bitcoin wrapped in wBTC.

Unlike wBTC, anetaBTC is entirely non-custodial, and all Bitcoin backing anetaBTC on a 1:1 basis is locked by fully-audited and open-source smart contracts that allow Bitcoin holders to directly mint and redeem anetaBTC. AnetaBTC seeks to be a truly decentralized, wrapped Bitcoin product on a secure third-generation blockchain platform with low and predictable transaction fees.

**Security and Privacy**

AnetaBTC is specifically built on Ergo for its security and privacy features. ErgoMixer opens the door to mixing anetaBTC, a native Ergo asset, without compromising security. AnetaBTC leverages Ergo's novel Sigma Protocols, a powerful implementation of Zero Knowledge Proofs

**Payment API**

This API can be easily implemented into any website and serves as a tool for merchants and individuals to have the capacity to seamlessly transact ADA on their online stores. The ability to seamlessly transact ERG is being developed in the background and will be released when its ready,

I'm looking for your insight into Web 3 and what it's truly capable of revolutionizing.

I've been having conversations with non-crypto friends about what crypto is, how I use it and what I think it can do. I don't talk about crypto as a replacement for currency as I don't think it is (at least any time soon and with any of the current projects). But I do talk about the benefits of not relying on a bank or having to pay crazy fees through Western Union etc.

What other things to do you think Web 3 can revolutionize or what is it already revolutionizing? What will it actually change in people's lives?

Saying "we are still early" is a form of confirmation bias and coping mechanism people use when in reality we aren't that early anymore. Bitcoin has a trillion dollar market cap and is the 10th most valuable asset in the world. I wouldn't call that being "early" anymore. Ethereum is #15. Large companies are now buying these assets. The days of 100x your money in a year is basically over. As for the shitcoins that do do that, look at the volume at the start. Barely anyone was trading back then.

Do I think there is still a lot of room for crypto to grow? Yes, but this isn't 2011 anymore. Most people who buy now aren't going to make insane gains and that's just the truth of it. There are 15,000 shitcoins in existence now, back in 2011 there were maybe 10. And the industry just started back then, now it's been around for 12 years. Much different ballgame now than it was back then. I'd say we are somewhere in the middle. Big gains can still be made but don't make the mistake of thinking this is 2011 and expecting a 1000x in one year.

Hi everyone!

I have a tax related question for any US expats that are on this sub. I live in the UK and have recently started dipping my feet into crypto. I wanted to ask how other US expats are handling their crypto gains with the IRS, particularly any % earned from staking. I'm not too worried about capital gains on sales at the moment as I plan on holding for the long term.

It's really important to me to make sure I'm doing this the right way with the taxman, but that I'm also being efficient and making the most of any loopholes etc. Afaik, gains from staking are taxed as Misc Income by HMRC in the UK. However, because the income itself isn't 'earned' I believe that I cannot claim it under the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion with the IRS.

I've never used the Foreign Tax Credits (FTC) before, but would that be the most efficient way of claiming this?

Or could I claim any staking income under my standard deduction with the IRS, while still paying tax on it in the UK?

If you've run into any other quirks buying/selling/dealing with crypto as a US expat abroad, feel free to drop it in the comments below.

Thanks!

Anyone, read the whitepaper?

&amp;#x200B;

So if you weren't here at the sub today, at the Crypto hearing one of the right honorable congressmen used the term 'Mongoose coin' and in a matter of hours, someone created a coin named after it...

Of course, as it's a meme-hype coin spreading throughout the media it'll probably will go to the Jupiter, but before that at least let all check if we can actually sell this one, cause well: I genuinely know a people or two who lost at Squid for this, LOL.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Y'all already gone balls deep into Mongoose am I right?**

You have to understand that, not only are you missing out on future profits, youre also removing your investment in the future of this technology. 

We have seen dips that like this followed by even stronger surges. Your participation in the crypto market drives the surges and the overall value. Dont sell when you see red. Understand that this is just temporary and remind yourself why you invested in this technology. This is just for profit and for the future of a world-changing technology. 

Dont sell the dip. Hodl and dip and buy the dip. Ill see you on the moon.

I recently made a [post](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r9m6iw/the_number_1_crypto_faucet_currently_02_per_use/) about a great faucet that gave about 20 cents per use and it had an unlimited number of uses. Unfortunately the team removed the most lucrative token from the faucet but there's a still a way it can be used to make about 5 cents per use!

All you need is an ERGO wallet (the easiest is Yoroi) where you can generate as many addresses as you want (on the Receive tab). Then you head over to [ergofaucet.org](https://ergofaucet.org/) and solve the CATPCHA to get the tokens sent to your address. You can do this as many times as you want with different addresses (best to use the same wallet so you can transfer everything in one transaction at the end).

Once you have the tokens, one of them will be Kushtis. These can be traded for Erdoge at the ERGO DEX, which can then be traded for ERGO or stablecoins! For more information about the DEX see here: [https://app.ergodex.io/swap](https://app.ergodex.io/swap)

Last time people were having problems getting the assets perhaps because the traffic was too high. I think they've fixed the problems now, but just leave a comment if you find any problems!

I honestly couldnt care less about price action on the short term. Bitcoin its just pure monetary energy, and it will be adopted by every single country around the world. 

I did buy at a high price, but eventually that price will just be a crash price.

Just trust in your investment guys, dont panic sell, and dont invest if you dont intend to hold it for at least a couple of years. Maybe if youre trading go ahead, sell and buy at your will, but thats not being an investor, thats just being a gambler.

Government should focus on audits to ensure projects are not just cash grabs and rug pulls, but they shouldn't start regulating crypto left and right blindly. People are scared of crypto because it's volatile and its new. They can't wrap their head around a digital currency just yet, but when banks start to accept it more, adoption will pick up in full steam. The rails are laid, now lets start the locomotive.

I, like most others on this sub, find it very difficult to take profits on coins that have shot up from their initial purchase. I constantly think that since this was money I was already investing with the mindset that it could go to 0, why take profits "now" when it could keep going higher? I keep most of my assets in CeFi or DeFi pools to generate yield, so even with price fluctuations I am still gaining APY%. However after the recent market crash I told myself that I would start doing a better job of "taking profits". And the simplest way to do this is just to swap your coin that's pumping for another asset or for USDC, and just hold onto the USDC until the price comes back down again. 

It's such a simple strategy but many of us just want to keep watching charts and do nothing about it. I was on this boat for almost all year but recently now I'm focusing more on using swaps to juggle assets around. For example I recently sold some MATIC at $2.50 when it hit ATH. Is there a chance it will go higher? Of course. But I still hold MATIC and can take more profits later, and this way I can either buy-back at a lower price or just invest the funds into USDC or another asset I feel will have a good upturn. 

Anyways that's my 2cents, happy buying y'all!

Purely hypothetical scenario: let say the CIA officially states they created Bitcoin. They don't have access to everyone's private keys, they just developed the system. Basically, they are Satoshi Nakamoto.

What do you think would happen? Would everyone sell Bitcoin because they don't believe in it anymore? If so, would they move to more decentralized altcoins, or would they completely give up on crypto?

Or could it perhaps be a bullish news, bringing in new investors who didn't trust Bitcoin before? Sadly, many people still think Bitcoin is a scam or simply don't trust or understand it enough to invest.

So, what do you think the majority of crypto investors would do? And what would you do specifically?

Again, this is just a hypothetical scenario. I don't believe the CIA is Satoshi. In fact, I believe Satoshi, whoever they were, is long time dead.

This week, news about Ubisoft's plans to start utilizing NFTs released, and I've seen a lot of posts from people who seem to think it's nothing more than an excuse to add more microtransactions at higher prices.

This perspective completely misses the point.

Some people get this, some don't: at their most basic, NFTs are uniquely identifiable tokens. It does not matter whether the original creator added additional data into the token, like a url to an image (this will contribute to my point later). All that matters is that every single person can check the blockchain and see which wallet owns that unique token.

On to their use in games: say Ubisoft begins issuing NFTs to represent skins in Rainbow Six Siege. Prior to using NFTs, the fact that you owned the skin is only verifiable to anyone who had access to Ubisoft's database. Now that the skin is an NFT, it is a uniquely identifiable token in your wallet on the blockchain. This means that every other person in the world can see that you own that unique item, without having to ask Ubisoft.

How is this beneficial? This means that Activision can offer benefits in their game to people who own Rainbow Six skin NFTs. Maybe they decide someone who holds a Rainbow Six skin gets a particular skin in Call of Duty (or something other than a skin).

Why would Activision do something like this? It can draw in Rainbow Six players to Call of Duty. Why is Ubisoft allowing this by issuing NFTs? Because they can get royalties off of their NFTs being traded, and now their NFTs will be attractive to not only Rainbow Six players, but also Call of Duty players. Meanwhile, Activision can and will likely issue their own NFTs to represent skins or guns in Call of Duty. And Ubisoft can then utilize Activision's NFTs in their game.

The beauty of all this being done on the blockchain? Activision and Ubisoft don't have to make a single negotiation or write specific code for to utilize another company's assets.

And it doesn't stop at large game makers. An indie dev company can now also make use of the Ubisoft and Activision NFTs to represent ANYTHING they want in their game. It doesn't matter that the Ubisoft NFT represents a skin in Rainbow Six, or that the Activision NFT represent a gun in Call of Duty. In each devs' own game, an NFT can represent whatever they want. The only important thing is that the owner of the token is verifiable on an publicly accessible, trustworthy  database (assuming a widely-used, decentralized block chain is used). And now this indie dev company has given Rainbow Six and Call of Duty players alike a reason to come try their game.

Why should a consumer like this? The consumer can now get an item in one game that provides them benefits in multiple games--those made by the same developer as well as games made by other developers. Additionally, if the consumer decides they're no longer into any of the games making use of a certain NFT collection, they now have the ability to sell any NFTs they own and recoup some of their spent money or even make a profit because the NFT could have more utility now than it did when they originally purchased it and may no longer be mintable.

Of course none of this is a guarantee, but it is what's possible when using a decentralized solution.

TLDR:

Company A uses NFT collection X to represent items in their games.

Company B uses Company A's NFT collection X to represent whatever they want in their game, without having to make any negotiation with company A or having to build tech specific to utilizing company A's data.

(An NFT is a token proving ownership, so company B does not have to care about company A's intention for what an NFT represents nor can company A impact what that NFT represents in company B's game).

Company A likes this because it adds longevity to their NFTs, and they can get a royalty every time their NFT is swapped.

Company B likes this because they can attract a bigger audience.

Consumer can now receive benefits from all games that utilize NFT collection X just by having purchased a single item represented as an NFT. And if they ever stop caring about the perks, they can sell it and possibly even profit.

TLDRTLDR:

NFTs prove ownership in a way that will allow different developers to utilize the same NFT in different games, without any negotiated cooperation. Both the NFT-minting and NFT-consuming developers will benefit, and the consumer will benefit as well.

Smooth brain  It seems to me that if a coin built on the Ethereum blockchain (Shib, usdc, polygon, Ethereum) are all in reality if broken down to the code all pieces of the Ethereum blockchain just with updated pieces of software, until that stable coin was truly cashed out or spent with a Cb debit card or some other true mechanism to move to fiat It seems like there is a logical structural arguement against there being an actual gain until someone were to truly leave the ecoystem.  Note I think this is a terrible idea to challenge on your own taxes or attempt to fight the IRS as a little guy but as a lobby/cex I feel like there is a plausible arguement that could be made in court that has some solid fundamentals behind it based on code.

Hypothetical future situation: If one company, such as Microstrategy, hoovered up every BTC in the world (which is certainly what they seem to be trying to do) and hodled it forever, what would happen to Bitcoin?

Would people ask Microstrategy for some sats at a certain price? What would be the point?

Would Microstrategy own an asset that is essentially a whole load of redundant ledger code leading up to the balance 100% belonging to them?

Would Microstrategy be the king of crypto?

Would Microstrategy be the ultimate loser of what turned out to be one giant pyramid scheme?

What is life?

Hey all I know we all do this especially in the ever changing Crypto Universe but there is a saying Dont should on yourself it can get messy. 

I personally remember bloody Friday when I watched ETH drop to $90. I was going to drop 4K on it at the time because it seemed like a steal. My wife and I were in the process of buying a house and I didnt want my bank account to show 4K to Coinbase and have to explain myself or be denied the finances to purchase our home. It definitely hurts knowing how much I could have made if I just bought the ETH. 

So if you find yourself saying I should have bought (whatever crypto) at blank $ amount. It will eat away at your mental health. We are here and I believe we are still early when it comes to investing in crypto. Dont be hard on yourself. If you believe in a coin/token and are in it for the long haul try not to look at the charts all the time and enjoy life and be glad you are here, at this time and dont Should on yourself!

Hi! I am kinda new to crypto and I'm also not sure about how to proceed with this:

I have all my crypto funds (not much) with the Exchange I use, none in a Wallet.

But most of what I have is staking in this exchange and I like the staking part of it. My question is: if I transfer my crypto to a wallet (e.g. Trust Wallet) can I still stake those coins?

And if I could still stake those coins, while staking, are the coins transferred to somewhere else or they remain on my wallet?

Thanks in advance.

Hi guys,

I have been building up my crypto for about 2 years now. It has taken me a very long time, but I have been enjoying it a lot along the way. 
I managed to get my assets to around 1000 last month (massive mark for me). I recently noticed an Instagram friend share how much he was able to make while working with a company fxfinancepips and I contacted him on Instagram to see if it was legit - he confirmed. 
Thinking it must be safe if he says so, I converted everything I had into bitcoin and sent it over to them. What. An. Idiot! 

The company told me my deposit was seeing extreme profit, but needed a signal fee of 1500 to continue trading (I dont have this money, thanks goodness). 

It wasnt until I texted the friend directly that he confirmed I had been talking to the person who hacked his account. 

I was genuinely blinded by the thought of making some serious money, that I missed the obvious signs. 

If your friend or someone you know shares anything similar, be sure to contact them directly to confirm. It will likely be an account hacker speaking to you on the platform they used to share. 

I will not get my money back, but I thought it best to let the community in on this scamming technique. 

Stay safe out there.

The term shitcoin refers to a cryptocurrency with little to no value or a digital currency that has no immediate, discernible purpose by definition.

We keep talking about not to invest in shitty coins.

According to you which is the shit coin you will not even want to invest your two cents on it?

And what are they ways we can 'DYOR' from which we can know a particular coin is a shit coin and stay away from it? Sometimes we think it has a utility but can turn out to be a scam or end up being a shitcoin in the long run.

Sorry, Absolute beginner here. I randomly bought some Bitcoin in July through Gemini, then checked again last month and it had doubled. Good start

Anyway now its gone down again and I wanted to buy more, but my bank (The Royal Bank Of Scotland) will not let me deposit into Gemini, as it says too many people are being scammed. 

Ridiculous. Im not being scammed, Ive done my research. I was hoping to deposit each month going forward.

Has anyone else experienced this and if so, do you know which exchange The Royal Bank of Scotland would let me deposit into??

And finally, what would be the best way to go about this, could I then transfer my current portfolio to the new exchange and if so would there be fees?

Thanks and once again sorry for being a newb

Yeah, I dared, I call Hal Finney Satoshi, ok now moving on while your heads are still spinning...

Finneys prescient email, which ends up taking the form of a cheesy  advert, states that the buying and selling of digital coins could mushroom into the trading of cryptographic trading cards which he calls  fascinating examples of the cryptographic arts. Finney jokes that they  will come to mirror standard physical cards:

&gt;Your friends will undoubtedly love these cryptographic  trading cards just as much. Theyll be eager to trade for them. Collect a  whole set!

 Finney even goes as far as describing the rarity concept:

&gt;They come in all kinds of varieties, from the common 1s,  to the rarer 50s, all the way up to the seldom-seen 1000s. Hours of  fun can be had for all.

[Project Jura](https://www.bis.org/publ/othp44.pdf), named after the mountains between the two countries is a partnership between the Bank of France (BDF), the Swiss Innovation Center (BISIH), the Swiss National Bank (SNB), Accenture of Credit Suisse, Natixis, R3, SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) and UBS. The project was initiated by the Central Bank of France and continued a series of experiments to test international payments in central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Sylvie Goulard, Deputy Governor of the Bank of France said:

***With the great success of Jura, the wholesale CBDC experiment program launched by the Banque de France in 2020 is now completed. Jura demonstrates how wholesale CBDC can optimize crosscurrency and crossborder settlements, which are a key facet of international transactions.***

The participants in the experiment came to the conclusion that the European financial system needs perfect and universal mechanisms for payments and settlements because the existing mechanisms include numerous intermediaries and additional elements of the financial market infrastructure. As a result, cross-border transactions have unreasonably high costs, they are slow, technologically complex, and potentially risky.

CBDC is a new technological approach for regulated financial institutions and central banks. A central bank-backed distributed ledger technology (DLT) based infrastructure can secure a financial ecosystem, offers more choice and competition in terms of cross-border payments and settlements.

Andra M Maechler, Swiss National Bank Board Member said:

*As a small open economy, Switzerland requires efficient and robust crossborder payment and settlement arrangements. Project Jura explores how distributed ledger technology can be successfully leveraged to map out how futureproof crossborder settlement between financial institutions could look like.*

The project participants tested direct transfers in euros and Swiss francs in the form of CBDC on a single DLT platform. The experiment was conducted under realistic conditions, using transactions with real value, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, as well as using payment versus payment (PvP) and delivery versus payment (DvP) mechanisms.

BISIH chief executive Benot Cur said:

***Project Jura confirms that a well-designed wholesale CBDC can play a critical role as a safe and neutral settlement asset for international financial transactions. It also demonstrates how central banks and the private sector can work together across borders to foster innovation.***

While Project Jura was a success, both central banks have warned that a set of banking rules and monitoring procedures, as well as contingency procedures, need to be formulated to ensure that CBDCs can be used in practice.

Andra M Maechler, said:

*It is an important experiment, the results have been very valuable, but there are many questions, both of a technological nature and very important policy questions which remain to be better understood.*

Central Banks of France and Switzerland announced the launch of a pilot project to test state digital currencies for international payments back in June this year.

I'd like to give my kids hardware wallets with a few hundred dollars of crypto in them as Christmas gifts this year. Looking for suggestions on which wallet would be best for something like this. I feel like the biggest risk is that they might lose the wallet (some are still pretty young). Is there any way to protect against this? 

Also, which coins I should load it up with? I already know it'll be mostly BTC and ETH, but might put a little of one or two other promising coins in. Obviously I'll do my own research, but suggestions here will help me narrow down which coins to look into.

Relatively new (8 months) to crypto, so still trying to learn as much as possible about it!

With the constant criticism of Facebooks(Meta) privacy handling, I'm wondering how everyone feels about their digital wallet, Novi.

I'm not too shocked that they have a road to blockchain utility, but I wonder how many would be willing to use their products when it comes to cryptocurrency and the like?

I also find it funny that Zuckerberg didn't integrate the Blockchain metaverse with his VR Metaverse project, when one would think the most intuitive partnership would be between virtual reality and crypto. 

I'm not a Zuckerberg hater, but I do see the pitfalls of the social media giants new path, but I am 100% behind it only because I see it as a strong step and influence on a real Metaverse that functions like it's own actual universe.

Decided to do a small compilation on what I have planned. It's to pass on this little bag of mine to my SO, nephews, and nieces in the event that they are the best successor(s) to my crypto in the future- if anything happens.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1: The Start (If you haven't)**

1. You can sign up with exchanges. Make sure you are comfy on how they can accept your payment (Bank transfer, Credit card, Etc).
2. You can start by buying crypto in the Exchanges first. Slowly, build up the portfolio that you want for your successors. You can and should DCA-in and stay consistent at it.
3. Every now and then (Say, every 4 months)- transfer the coins out to a hardware wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2: The Cold Storage**

1. Get a cold wallet such as Ledger Nano. Get it directly from Ledger themselves. No point saving a few bucks for a possibly compromised hardware.
2. Set the wallet for the kids. Write the seed phrases.
3. Make a test transfer. Maybe 1 XLM.
4. Reset the device.
5. Test the seed phrases that you've wrote.
6. The 1 XLM is there? Good. That's the correct wallet.
7. Transfer the amount that you want for your kids from the exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3: The Dead Man's Switch.**

1. Do a 'Dead Man's Switch.' So that your kids can access the guide on how to recover the wallet.
2. Record some videos, or prep some files on how to recover the wallet. I am assuming that Ledger devices will not last for over 5-10 years. There could be hardware longevity issues (Screen dies eventually). Therefore, assume that they would need to buy their own hardware devices in the future to recover.
3. Tutorial 1: How to buy authentic cold wallets.
4. Tutorial 2: How to use seed phrases to recover their wallets. In this tutorial, you should use a fake seed phrases to show them an example. Keep the true seed phrases elsewhere.
5. Tutorial 3: How to sell, or buy more crypto.
6. Final note: Tell them to go on a boating trip.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the plans can and should be changed according to your requirement.

I have never done anything related to finance throughout my studying career. I see the cruptocurrency market flourishing and feel now is the time for me to start investing my money and see this as a future platform. I have no idea on how crypto works and it'd pro's and cons. I want to learn but not through random YouTube videos, because they get confusing after one point of time. Are there any suggestions on how I could learn crypto, I am more than happy to do a few online courses to learn everything about crypto. Please enlighten me.

The truth about leverage margin trading

Just going through some previous threads on this sub and its clear there are a lot of people trying to discourage people from using leverage margin trading by falsely implying that you could end up owing money that you dont even have to the exchange. Correct me if Im wrong but most top exchanges like Binance dont have a debt creation mechanism. You cannot have a negative balance. 

Iv seen countless people here trying to imply that if you leverage $100 you can end up owing back thousands of dollars. That is a lie. You only lose what you leverage. I saw someone give an analogy of betting, if you bet at a ratio of 10:1, you can either win 10x of your bet or lose it all, thats the same with leverage, you only lose what you initially leveraged. 

Just as a disclaimer, I dont encourage leverage trading but I dont think people should be falsely scared into not using it. Its the same risk as gambling in a casino playing roulette in that you only lose the money you put in.

Edit: heres a link to some false fear mongering https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p3h6z1/explaining_leverage_and_how_scary_and_profitable/

As we all know Over the last 70 days the wider market has bounced back from the September crash and BTC seems content (for now) around 50K.

Yet over the past two+ months, ADA has continued to fall - it's down 10.5% in the past 7 days, 35% in the past month and 43% in the past 90 days.

Yes, ADA has been here since 2015, but ever since the ADA smart contracts came out the price has just been continuing to drop. People turned to Solana, instead, as well as other utility coins like AVAX, etc, etc.

Im not a holder of ADA but as the price continues to drop it risks being knocked out of the top 10 where Doge is waiting to take back its spot in the top 10. What does everyone think?

Well now that they have a bitcoin creator, a face to the name "Satoshi Nakamoto", what do you think will happen to the stability and value of the coin? Wasn't that the entire purpose of this, was to remain anonymous and not have a single person behind it? 

Do you think he is the real creator or do you think he is an imposter? Or maybe he was only a helping hand in it. And the "partner" who died in 2013 is actually the creator? Would that explain why the wallet was never touched since then? And there have been allegations going around for years that the og creator was killed or died early after the projects creation. 

There are a TON of hypotheticals going around about this and it's hard to Cypher the truth. 

I personally think the jury no matter what the verdict, should have forced the "creator" to use his security pass key to unlock the coins and prove without a shadow of a doubt that he is the true owner. But for some reason that wasn't the case.

What are your thoughts on this entire situation? Do you believe he is the true owner or a fraud?

 I'm thinking about getting a new phone some time soon and I'm kinda worried about transferring wallets from the old one to the new one. Of course, I have the seed phrases and everything safe, but I just haven't done it yet and I'm worried I'm going to mess something up.

Is it possible to activate my wallet on the new phone while still having it active on the old one?

Or would it be easier to just create a new wallet on the new phone and move my funds there without risking to mess something up with recovery?

NOTE: I know I haven't mentioned which wallet it is, but I would like to keep that information to myself and I assume most of them work in a similar way.

Hopefully this doesn't sound too dumb, I'm just in need for some advice from more experienced people :)

 Stephane Kasriel, head of Metas cryptocurrency and fintech unit Novi, officially announced on Wednesday that  WhatsApp, has started testing transactions through Metas Novi wallet.  He tweeted:

"There's a new way to try the Novi digital wallet. Starting today, a limited number of people in the US will be able to send and receive money using Novi on WhatsApp, making sending money to family and friends as easy as sending a message.  

Since we introduced the Novi pilot just six weeks ago, weve been able to test and learn which features and functionality are most important to people, and focus our efforts on making those even better. 

 We often hear that people use WhatsApp to coordinate sending money to loved ones, and Novi enables people to do that securely, instantly and with no fees. Payments will appear directly in peoples chat. 

 Were still very early in the Novi pilot journey, so we made the decision to test this new entry point in one country to start and will look to extend it once weve heard from people what they think of this new experience. "

As the title says,

We should make a challenge where people of this subreddit have a budget of $10 that they have to invest in different cryptocurrencies of their choice and keep it for a set amount of time. Two months or so. And maybe also add some sort of reward for this challenge that will be given to the person who made the biggest profit or the biggest loss with these $10.

I think $10 will be a fair budget because it will allow many people of this subreddit to take a part in this challenge.

Let me know for your opinions on this idea

There are two points of view going around on this sub this week about the adoption of crypto by the gaming industry. On one hand, some people see this as a major step toward mass adoption ; on the other hand, many people think those games are silly cash-grabs.

I think both sides have good arguments. NFT gaming will undoubtly help more people understand and appreciate blockchain technology, but at the same time, most of these games are hot pile of garbage from a UX point of view.

But I think that those discussions are kind of pointless. NFT and blockchain-based games are inevitable, whether we like it or not.

All the major game publishers have already entered the market. They are pouring vast sum of money into those games and ecosystems, hiring top-level engineers and producing slick marketing campaigns. They won't pull the plug just because we don't like it. There's a ton of money being made, so we can be sure the system will extract that value as much as it can.

I think we should accept this fact and move on. "Let go of what you can't control", as they say.

Expect Markets to drop potentially. That giant bank in China Evergrande? It just defaulted on its debt...this could have huge repercutions in the stock and crypto market.

However maybe since this has been coming we wont see a very large crash, only the next few days will tell, I just wanted to warn everyone..

I for one am glad this garbage will finally be over and we can stop worrying about this bank tanking the markets.

 On Wednesday, the Banque de France (BdF), the BIS Innovation Hub (BISIH) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) announced the success of a pilot run of a wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC), titled Project Jura. The project, which aimed to investigate crossborder settlement with euro and Swiss franc wCBDCs, was launched on a thirdparty distributed ledger technology platform.

The experimental technology explored in Project Jura consisted of a decentralized peertopeer network of computer nodes (Corda) to validate transactions while simultaneously ensuring that all legal, regulatory and business rules of governing nations are satisfied. Then, there was the tokenization of the aforementioned fiat currencies and the Negotiable European Commercial Paper, a short-term maturity (one year or less) debt instrument denominated in euros. Finally, Project Jura looked into infrastructure networks that enable realtime gross settlement of transactions, bond digitization and a digital assets registry.

Although the trial was successful, it does not guarantee the issuance of a wCBDC by Swiss, French or European Union authorities. The report concluded that "wCBDCs could be incorporated into novel settlement arrangements that could change the structure and functioning of capital markets, money markets and foreign exchange markets," saying that:

&gt;**"Broadening the use of central bank money through wider access or increased crossborder settlement could catalyse these changes, as could deeper integration of currencies with other digital assets and securities."**

lets say you have 100 dollars and am wondering how much profit it will take a day to turn that 100 dollars in to 10 000 dollars in a year.

so if you have that 100 dollars and use a margin of 10x so you have 1 000 dollars to trade with. then you make a 10% gain on day one. 

then you have 200 dollars that you can use as margin so now you can trade for 2 000 with a 10x margin....

and yea, if you could sustain that you would have 10 000 dollars in no time.

but the thing is that im not really good at math at all so, is there a website that you can type in what amount you have, and what margin you are going to use. and what amount you wish to reach in a set amount of time. and see how much gain you need to make a day/week/month to reach your goal?

All you had to do was send a message to u/bitcointip with the subject Free Bitcoin and say REDEEM KARMA followed by your wallet address. 

Typing all that sounds like a scam you expect to find in the comments section of Youtube, but this was 100% real and legit. 

As far as I know, it wasnt an official reddit thing, but a project by a crypto advocate. The purpose was to give redditors a few cents (which would be a couple hundred $$ now) to expose them to crypto and learn more about it. 

I dont know what the exact exchange rate was, but heres a sample conversion:

* 1,510,146 karma = you get 0.01510146 BTC (worth 15 cents back then, and $857 today)
* 543 karma = you get 0.00100543 BTC (worth $57 today)

Alternatively, you could also donate it to a public faucet instead of sending it to your wallet.

There was a 100 karma minimum and it was a once-per-user thing. You had to decide whether to cash in right now, or karmawhore some more for a bigger payday. 

Good times. 

Unfortunately, the bot was turned off a few years ago and doesnt work anymore (but youre free to still try - who knows?)

The plan was for Bitcoin to become the new world currency. But it cant be because it has fees and its slow. Now they want it to become gold, and everyone hoped Ethereum will be the currency we pay our groceries with, but nope, not going to happen. We have NFTs now, metaverse, meme, porn, music coins, etc. And yes we got some great technology from it. I love NFTs, I think they will be great in the future for a lot of reasons.
Its like everyone forgot the original idea, except, well, Nano (XNO), and probably few more coins that are not even in top 100. Their only focus is to make XNO a better currency. Fast and feeless. No, I dont want to shill Nano, Im just saying that it feels like people dont care anymore about digital currency taking over fiat. They use crypto to earn USD, not ETH or some other coin.

Anyone know of a bot for coinbase and coinbase pro. All I need it to do is auto send the coin to coinbase pro from coinbase and sell it at a price I set? I dont need it to do any thinking for me on what to buy and when. I hold coins on coinbase that gain APY so i need to leave them on coinbase to earn but I want to be able to sell them even if i aint home or am sleeping at the time. I have searched for bots but I have not found one that will move from coinbase to coinbase pro. Any help would be great.

What can i say guys, The true Diamond hand Warriors of you, like me, had a balling this year.  
First of all we didn't bought SquidGame Coin. Thanks god, who could have knew that i was a scam...  
Second of all we are all holding ETH because we fucking know that it is a fucking long time holding for the grandchildren of your granchildren. so they can live of the sweet APY in the year 3021.  


And oh, you guys know about the Metaverse? It's very sweet and could be the future by the way but there is one problem.  
Not everybody will enjoy this sweet future music aslong as there are so many people in really bad positions, not like us.  


So i thought about reminding my boys to take some dirty fiat money or some Cro Coins out of the Supercharger, not much, maybe 20-30/$ and spend it on some kind of charity maybe in your local charity or maybe on a topic u are very interested in.  


i know it could be 1 trillion in a year if well invested but you know, giving is nice.;)

Evergrande defaulted. Congress wants to regulate crypto. The U.S. govt almost shut down. PlanB got November BTC price prediction wrong and 100K by end of Dec. looks nearly impossible. 

Any one of these would have been the cause du jour of a crypto crash story (or two or ten) just weeks ago. 

And yet, nothing, thankfully, this time around. 

Maybe substantive posts about projects and their prospects are making a comeback. 

Here are some questions Ive been noodling. 

- Are metaverses another flash-in-the-pan crypto trend or a longer-term use case?

- Have meme coins had their day as Doge and Shib fall out of the top ten?

- Whats an up and coming use case for crypto after defi and entertainment (real estate, healthcare, telecom?)

[https://www.cryptonewsz.com/earth2-announces-partnership-with-polygon-studios-and-decentralization/](https://www.cryptonewsz.com/earth2-announces-partnership-with-polygon-studios-and-decentralization/)

Earth2 is a scam/cashgrab. I'm a little perplexed to be honest, i hold Polygon/Matic since a while and believe in the project, therefore i dont know how to interpret this partnership.

Is this a red flag for Polygon? Or what is going on. i mean.... is it possible [Earth2.io](https://Earth2.io) isn't a scam ? :DD

I mean you obviously heard and read about it. Polygon (MATIC) is hosting a zk summit thats starting in a few hours. Itll be one of the largest, if not the largest discussion about zk and the future of zk SNARKs, STARKs, and how to apply zk proofs.

In three months, MATIC has launched 3 zk oriented projects, Polygon Hermez, Polygun Nightfall, and the most recent is Polygon Miden. That actually made it a zk powerhouse. The advancements of Polygons technology was directly reflected on MATICs price performance, which was getting close on breaking its all time high in the last few days.

Im honestly looking forward for this event, and got my place ready to attend. Whats making it even more exciting is that leading names in Zero Knowledge space are going to be there, including Paul Brody, Chaitanya Konda, Jordi Baylina, and obviously Vitalik buterin. 

I believe itll be one of the most productive discussions of this year, and this can be a turning point in the scaling world, especially that there will be some sort of an exclusive announcement on the next big thing on Polygon.

Who else is joining this event?

Short story short was on crypto back in 2019 and left it for a while. I have a friend that's new to the stock market and want to invest on BTC or ETH but it's a weird time cause of Omicron . He asks me to help him but I am trying to get into these stuff again.. I don't want a regular trade advisor to scam him and get his money (btw we talking about 5 to 10k) , So can you navigate me and tell me which things I should look out the most ? Like whales or any sites I can see what's happening to the market real time ? Even with subscription
Thank you so much I am trying my best to study and figure out the situation of the market. I love this subreddit cause the people are all positive and want to help

Bitcoin maximalism is rationalism, not toxic. You know what is toxic? Unsound money. Shitcoins are shit because they are unsound money that is toxic to the human race.

We need to be pushing back harder against the shitcoin scams because they are increasingly becoming a giant distraction against the one technology that can save humanity from the jaws of fiat money, which is Bitcoin.

So what constitutes as a "Shitcoin scam"?

* Proof of stake = SCAM
* Premine = SCAM
* Venture capitalists = SCAM
* Centralized governance = SCAM
* ICO = SCAM
* Printing your own money = SCAM
* Bitcoin clones = SCAM

Bitcoin is about curing the world from the parasite called unsound money! Shitcoins just recreate more of the same problems that Bitcoin is attempt to fix.

Yoooo my fellow Beth holders,

Just wondering if theres any update on when Binance will swap Beth for eth in a 1:1 ratio. 

You can trade them as a pair at the moment but Beth has been getting weaker and weaker as the market cycle has progressed. You can currently sell 1 beth for 0.913 eth, but obviously would prefer to swap this in a 1:1 later on. If I were to sell it all as a pair right now it would totally negate the ~6 months of interest Ive accumulated. I do ideally want to sell some eth this market cycle so Im hoping itll be available before the peak. 

Anyone know how long itll be? And also hows everyone else finding holding Beth? Enjoying the little bit of interest youre getting?

I've been gaming ever since I was a kid, I got into crypto by selling my PUBG account and using the money to buy BTC. I see a lot of threads that say NFTs are useless and NFT games are shitty.

Well although they are true it's only to an extent. Here are my counter arguments why crypto brings major value to gaming than any other industry.

1: Digitally distributed games can take advantage of the Blockchain (NFTs) eradicating piracy if implemented correctly. 

2: Digital Game currencies like vBucks or Call of Duty points can be actually valuable and legally tradable. I already pay 10$ to buy a season pass, but now it's more valuable to grind and get all the coins back because I can trade it 

3: If a video game can be stored on the Blockchain (like torrents) and you need to activate it by approving the contract via your wallet that purchased it, then it's drm-free like physical games.


I know that NFT games like Axie Infinity killers are pretty shit, and I don't think they should even be considered as games. But crypto can bring so much value to gaming as a consumer and a producer it's revolutionary.

I've been in crypto on and off since early/mid 2017

Does the volatility ever get easier to stomach? 

I've been through the ups and downs. And its made me wiser.

But the volatility still makes me sick to my stomach.

Obviously I stay because of the potential for big, quick gains. But damn. Those violent swings never get easy

I guess the whole advice about when in doubt just hold, acquire more, rinse and repeat, is true.

Yes, you might miss big gains by not selling at highs. If you can sell ath then well done.

But the hold and buy more strategy and then sell somewhere in the middle method is less stressful I think.

It requires blind faith that long term the price will recover. But if you're bullish then it works well.

tl;dr: it is not early, but it is not late either. It is in fact a great time for everybody to find what they prefer in the early-late spectrum.

Maturity implies price stability, which is necessary for mainstream adoption, because high volatility is intimidating for most people. Therefore, not being early, and reaching maturity is good.

Some alts are new, and they have to find their price, but for the oldest cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, we see they are reaching maturity, and stability. See for example the rainbow charts: [BTC](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/), [ETH](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/ethereum-rainbow-chart/). After reaching maturity, the price may remain around the yellow lines, i.e. around the middle, without significant swings, as seen in the past.

However, if you miss "the early days", there are new cryptocurrencies created nearly constantly. DYOR, find the ones with good fundamentals, and wait until they reach maturity and their "true price". Note: This is not financial advice, it is not for the faint-hearted, and certainly it is not for the impatient.

It is not the early days for the stock market, but there are new startups every day. However, investing on startups is not easy. So far, the "permissionless" of blockchains means that you do not need to wait for new tokens to be listed in "the market"*, seed investing and venture capital is hard for companies, but not for crypto. With this paragraph I mean: it is not early for crypto, but it is not "late" either, as compared with stocks.

In summary, it is a great time.

\* Note: Some people may choose to wait for projects to be listed in their centralized exchanges. It is an option, a choice, and it is fine. The entry barrier is still lower than for regular companies.

As you all probably have experienced, the get of my lawn type people are hating on all coins and even making fun of shitcoins. They are doing whatever they can in their power to keep fiat as the main currency for ever.

But then we, the crypto generation laugh their speech away and call them boomers which gives the realization that in 10/20 years at max, most of these older generation are either dead or out of office.

The younger generation will be victorious, we will have the final say on this crypto vs fiat battle.

I kind of fail to understand why we all live in mortal fear of some Chinese Real estate company that is about to go bankrupt. &gt;BECAUSE IT COULD HURTY CRYPTO.  


Aren't we supposed to be at least partially above these things? Yet when the Stock-Exchanges dump, we dump with them. If Evergrande goes bankrupt, we dump. And everytime we here "Evergrande has this and that problem" we dump.  


And on TOP of that, if we hear something about Tether not really having 1 Dollar per Tether, then we dump too. So it seems to me - Bad news from the "Real world"? We dump. Bad news from the crypto world? We dump. China banning? We dump. India THINKING about banning something remotely related to Crypto? We dump. Elon Musk snzeezing? We PUMP! But sneezing again, but while he blinks? Dump.  


I was lead to believe, if the "real world" goes to shit, if inflation is high, if everything starts to burn, people would seach for their safe haven in Crypto. So what was my missconception?

I'm no doubting Bitcoin. It's the first coin, it's mathematically pure and it has changed the world forever.

The term altcoin was relevant back then when Bitcoin was the only important project in the cryptocurrency world.

But, this world has grown and changed so much and became one big ecosystem, with a place and need for many different kinds of coins.

It doesn't make sense for Ethereum or other coins that play an important part in the cryptocurrency world and offer good technology, that affects the economical situation of the entire world, to be called alternative coins.

They should be just be called coins or be called according to their use:

Meme coins, security tokens, payment methods etc.

If you're new and haven't been around atleast a couple cycles, it's easy to let the charts get to you when you're down. I used to check them constantly trying to find the "dip" (I didn't really understand what that was at the time) in the middle of a bull run... it was even more after it had a major, prolonged (actual) dip. I was off the ATH by less than 5% on the buy in. 

I remember feeling like a fool for learning FOMO the hard way. I also made the mistake of telling 2 people I got into Crypto, and was up. I was green for less than a week and was constantly asked 'how much was I up now?' In the following red months. 

Those months did end though. I kept buying, lowering my average purchase price. Even with recent 'crashes' (I use that term loosely) I'm still green.

Now not every coin does this, but some do. DYOR to find out which ones.

16390531132021-12-09
Basically everyday I look for new shitcoins with a lot of decimals on coin market cap and if it has more than 8 decimals and showing a bit of a rise I chance it and put a bit of money in, 10 or 20. Newest chance is MTX (Matrix Protocol) and its already risen 300% in the last couple of days. Hasnt netted me crazy amounts, but I like seeing the green. I always cash out when it hits $30 or $40 and move the gains to more stable coins. Only thing I hate though is the feeling what if it goes crazy and I could have made a substantial amount if I held for a much longer time period.

Hi all,

This is my first post on this board so i thought i would start with talking about a little side project ive been coding.

Having been following crypto for many years since it's Inception it's gradually become something I struggle to keep up with having exploded into hundreds of different coins and full-fledged trading.

So I decided to to put the the knowledge of what I like to monitor into artificial intelligence and get it to summarise and even suggest areas I should be looking at in the cryptocurrency space.

Right now I think it's working really well but I'm open to 2 to suggestions as what information ai I can ingest and perhaps how I should weight its relevance.

The AI currently tweets its findings and maybe if this post gets some good traction i can share its Twitter handle.

On thing i like the idea of thought is trying to ingest content in real time from some of the highest trafficked areas of the web so please share in the comments.

Honest question, I've just looked that he has a twitter and boy, the comments he gets would make me rethink myself as a human being (clearly not an issue for him, I understand), like here: [https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1468294568646877184](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1468294568646877184)

Seriously, now with congresspeople shittalking him for being shady about the futures ETF vs spot ETF like yesterday, populace hating him, how is there no tool to have a vote of no confidence or something? Not an American but was he elected democratically? If not, how is it investors have no say who regulates them in a democratic system? If yes, then congrats to the people who elected a literal banker to rule over their crypto and stock investments. If you were tasked with defending Troy, you wouldn't just let the Trojan horse in, you'd put it on the throne and ask for regulation. 

Either way, how can a public official possibly think they serve the populace, when literally 100% of the public responses are either lack of trust, mockery, fear or hatred? Even bad politicians have at least SOME approval rating, but what I see in responses is no support whatsoever for anything he's doing or represents, from anyone at all.

Hi guys!

I've made a new video tutorial about a strategy that I use and make more than 50% APR on the Terra ecosystem:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-ZX-aKfCyw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-ZX-aKfCyw)

In the video, we will also discuss all the risks (stability of UST, Anchor protocol Smart Contracts, and Mirror Protocol Smart Contracts), and the advantages of this strategy. 

We are going to use Terra (Luna) Chain; Terra Stable coin; Anchor protocol; Mirror protocol and Delta Neutral strategy. 

**Anchor protocol** \- lets you stake your UST tokens and generate 19.5% APR. T

**The Delta Neutral strategy** \- a strategy by which you can make money without having to forecast the direction of the market. 

On **Mirror Protocol** we will have to pick a farm with high APR on a short farm and long farm.  

We will divide our budget to  on short anchor and  on Mirror to have a safe collateral ratio of 200%. 

Let me know what do you think about this strategy and if you have any questions - I will be more than happy to help.

Thanks :)

Ava Labs has been selected to join Mastercard Start Path Crypto, a startup engagement program dedicated to exploring and solving how blockchain technology can democratize use cases for people and businesses around the world.

Enterprise interest in Ava Labs and Avalanche rapidly increasing after year of exponential growth.

Mastercard is setting an example for leaders across all industries on how to embrace, rather than combat innovation, says John Wu, President of Ava Labs.

We all knew few weeks ago the entire industry was bullish when btc touched 69K and most of the institution started buying , we got the ETF , institutions started claiming btc to be the inflationary hedge.
We came to see some onchain metrics which showed us btc is held by everyone and that btc is going to 98K as said.

But with the crash back to 42K just showed us btc never listens to anyone but it has its own price movements. As investors you can always Hodl and average your investment when there is a fall like this is you're in for the long term and don't listen to the youtubers about your investment

At the moment I see some kind of stagnation in the market. Big cryptocurrencies like BTC and Ethereum are in flat, which affects the general mood of the market.

But there are some coins which continue to grow regardless of the market. For example Near Protocol, let's take a look at this example.

Right now it's up more than 10%, at its peak it was about 25%, although the mood of the market hasn't changed. I understand that there's a powerful team there, powerful technology, but then why isn't it growing all the time. Why did it happen in a falling market?

I wanted to get a majority opinion and find out exactly why this is the case. Why a falling market is the driving force behind some projects.

Why does this happen?

**INTRODUCTION**  
One of the biggest discussion points we have here is WEN BEAR and how to approach it.   


Historically, it seems the market moved in 4-year cycles based on the bitcoin halvings. Many people believe that a major crash and prolonged (years) bear market will hit soon. Others are saying that things are different because of increased institutional adaption etc.   


Based on this info you have a few options.   


1) DCA. Invest the same amount every month. You ignore whether the price is high or low. You are just betting that over time, the market will increase. If you have anxiety about charts etc, this may the best option for you.  


2) Time the market. If you can time the market well (sell close to the top of the bull market, use that money to buy in at the bottom of the bear market), you can make INSANE gains. Very difficult to do and easy way to get rekt, but if you pull it off (IMO by chance), you will be rewarded greatly and you'll feel smart. Perhaps important to point out: a risk of pulling off this strategy successfully, is that you think too highly of your skills and you will try to do it again in the future (and then might get rekt on the second try).   


**ACCUMULATE STABLES IN A BULL MARKET**   


3. Use a combination of 1 and 2. DCA every month. But depending on your position, cost basis, and how you feel about the bull/bear market, allocate a proportion of that DCA to stable coins.   
Examples: you DCA 500 dollar every month. 

  
\- If BTC's (insert your coin here) current price is lower than your average cost basis, put the entire 500 dolar towards BTC and lower your cost basis. 

\- BTC's price is higher than your average cost basis, put 250 towards BTC and 250 towards stable coins. - BTC's price is much higher than your average cost basis and you believe the bear market is near: but 100 towards BTC and 400 towards stable coins.   


So essentially I propose to accumulate stable coins in a bull market. Why?  


1) If the market continues to stay bullish for a long time: your BTC went up and your stables gave good yield. End result: you are well off.   


2) If the market moves mostly sideways for a long time. Your stable coins gave you a good yield. End result: you are off pretty well.   


3) If the market crashes: you have stables accumulated and who have been gaining interest ready to buy the crash, drastically lower your cost basis, and set you up for insane gains in the future. If you believe that a bear market is coming based on past trends, you also believe that a bull will come eventually. So start preparing.   


It's easy to get 8-20% yield on your stables. That is INSANE for a guaranteed outcome (we are spoiled by 100x YOLOS). Even more so because it sets you up for insane gains in future bull runs if you're that desperate for the 100X yolos.   


CeFi platforms such as Celcius, NEXO, etc give 8% yield and are very easy to use.   
DeFI platforms such as Anchor protocol give 20% and still fairly easy to use (getting UST is more difficult than using the DEFI application itself).   


Accumulating stable coins in preparation for potential bull markets stabilized your portfolio. Yes you make slightly less gains during the bull market (you make the 8-20% yield while many crypto's will increase in price more). But you are massively protecting yourself against the bull market and will almost be happy when it arrives.   


If many people would use this strategy, it would help stabilize the market (everyone is buying the crash, essentially preventing the prolonged bear market)  


TLDR:  
\- Allocate a portion of your DCA into stable coins during a bull and earn yield on them. This is a combi between HODL/accumulate and timing the market.

First of all, I think you should take all the crypto-youtubers with a grain of salt and you are probably better off staying away from 99% of them. With that said I do subscribe to a few channels that provide me with what I consider valuable insight/news. Once again with a grain of salt and the assumption that they are all trying to sell me things and are all crypto-maximalists.  


Now, technical analysts always come to the same conclusion, we can go up, down, or trade sideways. No one has a crystal ball they can predict the future with and that is OK, if they claim they do - run the other way. however, I still think technical analysis can be useful to spot trends, support levels for good entry points etc.

Now back to Benjamin Cowen. In a recent video he posted he said that people thought 2021 was going to be a parabolic year for Bitcoin but it turned out to be a good consolidation year. This is something I don't understand, the market cap more than doubled and has put in two ATH's. If that is not parabolic then what is?  
Another thing is that we apparently haven't seen an "alt season" yet. I mean most altcoins have done at least a 2x with many doing a 5-10X, we even had dog coins like Doge pump almost 10000% and Shib 2 million percent!? Is that not an alt season??

Benjamin also said that he thought this cycle was gonna have a double peak, now that we have two ATH's and are trending down it's apparently not over yet and we haven't seen the market cycle peak yet?  


I mean I'm addicted to hopium as much as the next crypto-redditor but  I think aforementioned things are a bit ridiculous.  
I'd love to get your thoughts on this. Am I wrong, am I misunderstanding things?
-------------------------------
16390511912021-12-09
Most of you are probably invested in cryptocurrencies. I am as well. So it's in your - and my - best interest to remain as objective about crypto as you can be, consider positive and negative arguments regarding the coins or tokens you hold or might want to buy, so you can make sound financial decisions. Right?

This is not how most people treat this sub, however. They like certain coins and dislike others, interpret everything about them in a positive or negative way, respectively. Negative news about this token I hold? Let's downvote it and try to make a positive spin out of it in the comments, that 51% attack was in fact **great** for the future of my coin. It is **good** for the environment, that BTC uses so much energy. It's **awesome** for moons that Reddit will introduce tokens for other subs as well and they will have nothing unique about them anymore.

On the other hand, it really doesn't matter what is said about the coins that are disliked on this sub, the argument can be incredibly bad, it will be taken at face value. One example: the biggest post that was made yesterday was about DOGE being, pretty much, over. The main "argument"? 

&gt;"The wider market has bounced back [but] it's down 32.3% in the past 30 days, 20.4% in the past two weeks and 16.1% in the past seven days." 

BTC itself is down 27% over the past 30 days, and do you know how many coins in the top 100 are currently down more than 30% in that time frame? **42**. if you disregard all stable coins in the top 100 (which obviously won't go down 30%) this is almost half. VET, DOT, ADA, ONE and LINK are all down more than DOGE in that time frame. Would a post stating that any of these coins is dead because of that have gotten thousands of upvotes? Of course not!

I know what some of you are thinking: but this sub has 4 million users, it totally makes sense to convince them that my token is the best so they buy it and the price goes up! But only a small share of these users are active and only the very, very biggest posts are read by a few 10,000 users. most likely, a few dozen to a few hundred people will read your spin on a negative argument about that coin you hold - which is probably a top 100 coin with a market cap of more than a billion. If 3, 10, even 100 of them buy it because of you, do you think this will affect the price of your coin in a relevant way?

If you are not open to opposing arguments and just spin everything the way you want it to be, you are setting yourself up for disaster. Who could have seen the crash of your coin coming? Not you if you ignore the bad news or tried to explain to the 7 other readers of a thread why it's actually good news. We all have our favorite coins, but be open minded that there might be negative developments and that, maybe, if those bad news gain the upper hand, you should even sell - or maybe you find out that a coin that you used to hate really had some good developments and that you should buy some. You are most likely in crypto to make money, not so your favorite coin wins the race. Treat this sub as a source of information and a place to exchange valid arguments, not as a debate club where all that counts is winning the discussion.

**tl;dr: if you already decided which coins are good and which are bad, just spin every news about it that way and try to convince others why it is good or bad, you will most likely make stupid financial decisions. have your favorites, but try to be open minded and objective**

Hi fam, I just wanted to ask a question about marketcap of Cardano since there are currently on 45 billion. That means, all of them are currently circulating, staked and investors are holding it? So if a lot if holders decided to sell it, let say 20 billion of it. That means, the new total marketcap will be 25 billion? 

Sorry guys, I am really new to cryptocurrency as I learn my way digging these stuff haha. Because after the recent bitcoin dropped, I noticed that the BTC marketcap was down from 1 trillion to 900 billion. I dont know if thats how it works. Hope you guys could enlighten me.

I just sniped this thing on bscscan today..
Called Harley FOMO
A contract where you can own maximum 100 coins and max supply is 10.000. 

You can only sell 1 token every day. 
It will be interesting to see what direction this type of contract takes.

As far as I know, The100 was the first contract with this concept. It's now worth arround 40-50 dollars for each coin, with an mc of 4-500.000.

A fork of this contract with the same tokenomics just launched named Harley FOMO. Marketcap is now just under 40.000. And each coin is worth 4 dollars.

If you ape in to this, you can't jeet because you can only sell one token every day....


- I wonder, what kind of direction will this take? If it gets stuck on a low mc, it will take months to sell it all..

- It seems like everytime the buy pressure drops it always have time to gain it back before everybody can sell, with good margin..

I'm sure you've all seen the buzzwords everywhere; NFTs, NFT games, metaverse, NFT ticketing, VR space, whitelists.

Well I just found an event (livestream concert) from faceless Avatars that not only contains all the buzzwords, but apparently actually does something with them as well. Here's [the tweet](https://twitter.com/facelessavatars/status/1458868307809951747) and here's the [actual event](https://guts.events/mb569u/s3q924) itself.

I've 'bought' a ticket myself (is free so why the heck not) and it's all legit afaik. The event is this weekend. Pretty neat to see some parties actually doing something instead of throwing the buzzwords around.

What do you guys think? Still just buzzwords, or proper real life example of them?

WhatsApp has launched a new pilot that lets a limited number of people in the US send and receive money from within a chat using cryptocurrency. The feature is powered by Novi, Metas digital wallet that launched as a pilot six weeks ago, with payments made using Pax Dollars (USDP), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar issued by Paxos. The news was announced by Novis incoming head Stephane Kasriel and WhatsApps Will Cathcart.

The new pilot has its roots in Facebooks (now Metas) much-hyped cryptocurrency plans, which were officially announced in 2019.

Hi My fellow Crypto amigo's

Last time iv'e seen some posts on this subreddit and other crypto sub reddit.With the titel WHY......... IS THE BTC/ETH KILLER!!! I believe these two can't be killed. But, I do believe some crypto will ascent and join them.

So imagine this, It's 10 years from now. BTC an ETH are still on the top. But which crypto will have the same price/marketcap (or above) As ETH and BTC have right now? and why? I'am very curious which coin will have a ATH of **$68,789.63** or If this is even possible.

Everyone has it's favorites and maybe this wil be the post to give you the hopium you need to get trough this correction fase.

Beware my crypto amigo, don't take this as financial advise. Because that is not my flow.

Whitepaper used to be very important document of a Crypto project but with time some people brought a bad name to whitepaper and become a tool to steal people's money.

People behind scam coin's used whitepaper to lure investors, mostly newcomers to invest their money into their scam coin, and when they got control over people's money then they pulled the rug and ran off with people's money. 

Satoshi released BTC's whitepaper to introduce what he has created, the purpose behind creating it and how BTC can be used. After BTC, whitepaper continues to hold a good reputation and investors look at it as a reliable document on which they can trust while putting their hard earned money.

But with time the meaning and importance of whitepaper has changed and there are thousands of Coin's claiming to solve different problems, with different use cases in their respective whitepapers.

Simply whitepaper turned into a list of promises less of achievements to make you believe and with the motive to take control of your money.Once the people behind a project have control of your money then the rules, promises can change any time.
There are hundreds of examples infront of you, where whitepaper claimed to achieve so many good things in future, but after taking your money, the whitepaper means nothing and the intentions,vision gets changed overnight. 

TL,DR : The meaning,importance of Whitepaper is no longer the same which is supposed to be back then.

I have been looking up for some DAO s and the Jade Protocol looks pretty decent. It runs on the (3,3) staking thing so more the count of people, the higher the returns to everyone. We need to increase the market cap of it. It is just free money for everyone with really high returns. So lets jump Jade Protocol to the moon like OHM and we will all earn a lot. It is just win win for everyone and because it is a DAO, there is little or no chance it will die and there are lots of good reasons to invest on it. There are 4M people in here. Even if 10k people put 300 dollars to staking, it would increase like 3M dollars. And if 1M people here see this, you get where this is going, it is a lot. And I am not talking about quick money, this is exponential growth. If you are gonna stake it for only a day, it is no use. Im gonna try keeping this for a year. I think this is a good opportunity. This is the link: www.jadeprotocol.io

The thought of a crypto credit card has definitely piqued my interest in the past. This morning I recieved a prompt from Shakepay (a fiat on-loading app in Canada) saying that their credit card is now live. It returns 2% Bitcoin on every purchase made at a VISA vendor, and there is no annual fees or credit checks.

I've got a feeling this isn't my best option. What are your favorite crypto credit card? What are the perks of them?

I'd be glad to hear from people all over the world, but if there's any that are specific to Canada I'd like to hear about those for sure.

Merrymen is suppose to be the answer to Robinhoods disgusting treatment of its users, and wrote this in an Medium article in late july:

"Merrymen, a brand new DAO based decentralized exchange (DEX) on the BSC network, is today announcing its unique tokenomics.
Created to demonstrate how important decentralized finance (DeFi) and DEXs are to the retail investor, Merrymen will make available 30% of its tokens to its investment community through its IDO. It will also airdrop 10% of its tokens to Robinhood investors who lost money through the GameStop fiasco and 10% of its tokens to the communities of projects who provide liquidity on the exchange. Additionally, 10% of the supply will be allocated to projects having their raise on Genesis Pool that will list on the Merrymen DEX post-IDO.
With these three allocations combined, that is an incredible 70% of the total tokens minted being allocated to retail investors. This will allow Merrymen to bring in a whole new group of crypto retail investors into the world of DeFi and the Merrymen ecosystem."

This sounds great and all, but is it the real deal? How can I identify if this is just a rug pull in the making?

I'm wondering if there's a platform where they aggregate NFT volumes from the vast different platforms (Just like CMP does for coins).

Coingecko for example show data of only 75 collections.  
Opensea has over a 1000 of collections  
Binance NFT platform has a lot of collections  
Immutable X now has a large growing trading platform  
And it goes on and on...

So, do you know of any place where all the data cross-chain cross-platforms is aggregated for NFTs?  
Preferably a website that has an API, though I believe that if such a website exists with so much data it would be almost obvious for it to have an API. So that one could have a broad lookout on the NFT market

If such a platform does not exists that would a bit bizarre. Since the NFT market is quite developed already.

  
Thank you for your time dear people! And have a great life!

I've been really stupid here and have somehow ended up with my account hacked. I think it was a link from a telegram group that was supposed to help people who were buying shinja. / yes, I was very naive and sent my seed to that page.

After that I noticed my shinja had been converted to eth then forwarded on to 0xcbD03816040313Def5d2A369fb21C33199D71B92

Is there any way to recover? I've read articles on the police recovering funds. Would they only recover large amounts? What is peoples experiences of this? Has anyone on here had funds personally recovered?

Is it possible to trace or gather more information on the address at all?

I had a wallet associated with zumo and metal ask - would they offer support?

Is there any protection from credit card companies? I bought the ETH with my credit card. Would this come under "section 75" protection, could I claim anything back through them?

Section 75  your free credit card purchase protection

What is Section 75?

Its part of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 that means your credit card provider is jointly and severally responsible for any breach of contract or misrepresentation by a retailer or trader. It allows you to make a claim against your credit card company to get your money back if a retailer or trader lets you down and refuses to honour the contract properly - including if it goes bust.

How does it work?

The goods or service you bought must have cost over 100 and not more than 30,000.

However, to claim under Section 75 you don't have to have paid more than 100 or the full amount on your credit card  the card company is liable even if you made only part of the payment - perhaps a deposit - on your card.

For example, if you book a hotel costing 2,000 and pay a 60 deposit on the card and the rest by cheque or debit card, you would be covered for the whole amount if the hotel went out of business and you didn't get to have your stay.

What does Section 75 cover?

It covers a wide range of instances:

You can claim if you order goods that dont arrive or that are not in the condition described when purchased.

It covers costs but theres also an opportunity to claim for associated costs. So, if an airline went bust when you were on holiday and you needed to book new return flights to get home, these costs should be covered.

It applies to foreign transactions as well as goods bought online, by telephone, or mail order for delivery to the UK from overseas.

You can even claim against a now closed credit card account.

The law also applies to store cards.

What doesnt it cover?

There must be a direct link payment to the company youre claiming from for Section 75 to apply. However, PayPal can be an exception as its still possible to claim against the credit card company providing PayPal has a 'Commercial Entity Agreement' with them.

Taking out cash on a credit card and using the cash to pay doesnt give you Section 75 protection.

Theres some small print on the minimum of 100 spend too. If you bought two items that together cost more than 100, but each cost less than 100, Section 75 would not apply.

It doesnt apply when an item is faulty but still under warranty with the manufacturer. You need to take that up with the manufacturer directly.


Or is it a total lost cause and a hard lesson to be learned here.

Please correct me if I'm wrong or missed something. Math has never been my strong point. 

The current price of M00ns is $0.119 and there are currently about 80,000,000 M00ns in circulation, which equates to a market cap of $9,520,000.

Since the maximum number of M00ns ever issued is 250,000,000, that would be $29,750,000 at the current price.To reach a price of $1, there would have to be $250,000,000 in circulation. 

$250,000,000 still seems very low to me for a platform with this reach. Not to mention that we will not reach the maximum number of the total supply 250,000,000 m00ns in the next few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

To reach the top 100 with the 80,000,000 circulating supplies currently in circulation, we would be at $10.83 for the value of one m00n.

As an example, I used: Rank 100 ICON (ICX) with a market cap of $866,236,889, a price of $1.29 and a circulating inventory of 677,632,697 ICX.

&amp;#x200B;

First, please comment immediately if you notice an error like above, I have no math affinity at all, second, how realistic do you think it is that M00ns will eventually be in the TOP 100?

I understand that m00ns currently have no use, but in the past meme coins that had no real use have even made it into the top 10. 

Let me know what you think about it

So apparently Evergrande has defaulted. Will it cause another GFC? No. The chinese knew this and they have printed 200 million to bail them out. So now that we have got that out of the way lets see how it effects crypto. 

What if the market crashes? HODL and buy the dip if you have fiat for the love of god dont sell at a loss. If youre truely a believer in the coin you have invested in you should be drooling over these dips.

What if the market pumps? Well watch the rocket go up and if your a little sceptical take some profits along the way or just HODL.

What if Im stressed? Take a break for the charts and focus on something else to take your mind off it. 

Seriously it isnt rocket science everyone needs to take a chill pill. 

Enjoy the ride everyone there is never a dull day in the free crypto world

In the infamous "leak" published by gizmodo and supposedly outing Craig Wright as Satoshi, there is an email that - if true - would be a real bomb.

it is dated march 12th 2008 and it reads:

&gt;I need your help editing a paper I am going to release later this year. I have been working on a new form of electronic money. Bit cash, Bitcoin...  
You are always there for me Dave. I want you to be part of it all.  
I cannot release it as me. GMX, Vistomail and Tor. I need your help and I need a version of me to make this work that is better than me.  
Craig

([https://youtu.be/SJpj0zj35zQ](https://youtu.be/SJpj0zj35zQ))

This mail wants to show that the early idea of bitcoin came from Wright to Kleiman, and not the other way around.

Needless to say, it is extremely suspect.

One thing I have found is that not only it is suspect, but it is provably false.

The domain information-defense.com from which this email supposedly originates (the sender is [craig.wright@information-defense.com](mailto:craig.wright@information-defense.com) ) was only registered by Wright on jan 23rd 2009, when he registered the Australian company "Information Defense PTY".

BTW, this was just a couple weeks after the blockchain started, and this company is somehow the predecessor of the similarly named American company "W &amp; K Info Defence Ltd" controlled by Kleiman and later passed back to Wright.

The fact is, I believe "Information Defense PTY" is indeed related to bitcoin mining, but I think it's pretty likely that Wright forged that email in order to establish a priority over Kleiman.

That domain wasn't his in march 2008.

Gizmodo explains the problem saying:

&gt;pointing to the likelihood that its registration lapsed and was later renewed, which would explain the discrepancy

( [https://gizmodo.com/the-mystery-of-craig-wright-and-bitcoin-isnt-solved-yet-1747576675](https://gizmodo.com/the-mystery-of-craig-wright-and-bitcoin-isnt-solved-yet-1747576675) )

but this just does not hold, in light of an historical whois search

On Aug 25, 2007 the registrant was a "John W#####ck, 26 New Lane S####n, NY nnnnn-nnnnn US" and expiry date was 15-Mar-2008. (redacted to protect privacy of previous owner)

On may 27th, 2008 the domain was listed in a list of domains in pending-delete state: [https://web.archive.org/web/20151226101620/http://www.expire.cc/2008/05/27](https://web.archive.org/web/20151226101620/http://www.expire.cc/2008/05/27)

The domain probably expired, and on Jun 1, 2008 the domain owner was "eNom, Inc. on behalf of eNom, Inc. Customer TBD eNom Customer TBD eNom Customer ([legal@enom.com](mailto:legal@enom.com))"

Enom is a registrar, who had a "back-ordering" service for expired domains" this appears to be an ownership used by Enom for "domain tasting" ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain\_tasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_tasting) )

Only on jan 23rd 2009 the domain was bought by Wright (presumably he got it from eNom) and shortly later archive.org shows a site for the first time: [https://web.archive.org/web/20090216141126/http://information-defense.com:80/](https://web.archive.org/web/20090216141126/http://information-defense.com:80/)

So, I think that email is a provable forgery.

For the skepticals: the historical whois of the domain can be ordered for $49 from domaintools.com . I am not going to publish the report's PDF because its copyright status is unclear.

Probably most of you won't need to hear this but I'd like to remind us all that whatever the market does, we are never losing coins. However trivial, I find that comforting. If you bought into a project you believe in and its price is suffering, you still have the same amout of coins that you bought.

You might have gotten more at a different price, and of course buying the bottom would have been lovely, but at whatever point you buy in, your bag of coins is now bigger than it was before.

If you don't like what your portfolio is worth but you're still convinced by the projects you've invested in, just take a look at the number of coins you have. LINK doesn't move? At some point, it probably will.

Don't get too hung up about the right moment to buy in and percentages. They're true and often seem relentless. But in contrast to the number (or fractions) of coins you have, they're only snapshots in time. Both numbers are true, but you're in it to make big money, so with all your daily chart watching, how about a good strong look at that bag of yours, too?

It scares me how much people here and in other crypto spaces are willing to sell the things they like to crypto and NFTs without a second thought just for further implementation.

There's a post in the front page calling people who don't want crypto or NFTs on games idiots, and I can't wrap my head around that. Do you really want crypto to become a part of everyday gaming? To fall on the lap of EA or Activision? Aren't pre-orders and paid DLCs bad enough?

And to top it all off, do you really want to turn gaming into a second job? That's the part I really can't understand. Gaming is my escape from work, the one thing I can do to relax, and people want it to be a paid thing? 

What's next, crypto rewards for eating, for breathing, for going out on a walk, all dependent on how well you do it? Do you really want to gamify your life, your free time and the experiences that are meant to be your escape from trying to make money? Is that really the world you want?

This is very exaggerated and dramatic probably, but this is how I feel. I really don't think Crypto will make games better in any way, I think people just want to believe that because it'll make them money.

LRC really is one of the best investments I made this year. It's not quite as good as ADA was back then, but then again I invested into LRC with the money I got from ADA, so that just keeps growing and growing.

I saw the rumors about possible big news coming soon, and also possible drops during the "sell the news" stage.

Regardless, I did what everyone should do if they got big gains on LRC, and took out my initial investment shortly before the big crash last week, and now the money I got on LRC is just house money.

That way, whether LRC explodes upwards or tanks downwards, I'm sitting pretty. It's money I didn't have before, so I don't gotta worry abou it.

Remember, if your money triples on a certain investment, it's always a good idea to take out what you initially put in, just in case.

Hello people

The music industry has been in a state of *upheaval* for the past decade. The arrival of streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music has disrupted conventional models, bringing artists to a broader audience while eroding profit margins for labels and musicians. Artists are becoming frustrated with unfair **royalty rates**, limited resources for marketing, and data mining by third-party companies that profit from their hard work.

Now, we're starting to see a similar effect with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.**NFTs**are a new technology that could potentially be applied to the problem of making music**profitable**again.

What if **Fractional Ownership** (in F-NFT) could be the solution?

Key Points
Bitcoin offers one of the best risk/reward profiles out there.
Leading U.S. tech stocks are arguably still overvalued.
Blue-chip stocks that have already sold off may be the best option out there.
In just a few short weeks, the U.S. stock market and the global crypto market have suffered sizable sell-offs as investors grappled with slowing growth, valuation concerns, a new COVID-19 variant, inflation, and other headwinds.

Industry watchers that have patiently waited for prices to come down are in luck. But even fully invested folks may be wondering if it's best to invest in crypto or stocks in 2022 and beyond. Here's a breakdown of both markets and the best buys in each.

A good time to buy "blue-chip" cryptos like Bitcoin
Fear of missing out (FOMO) is a dangerous emotion that can pressure us to chase skyrocketing valuations and cloud our judgment. If you've felt like you've missed out on Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH), you're not alone.

Just like stocks, investing in cryptocurrency has its risks. And picking specific cryptos, especially smaller altcoins, can be feast or famine. Solana (CRYPTO:SOL) has captured investors' imaginations for its over-12-fold return so far in 2021. But for every Solana-like success story, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of failures.

If you're new or unfamiliar with crypto, simply going with the industry leaders is probably the best way to expose yourself to an attractive risk/reward profile. Bitcoin has the reputation of being complicated, risky, and has long been accused of being a bubble. But at its core, its investment thesis is beautifully simple.

Bitcoin has a market cap of $925 billion. It sounds like a lot until you realize what its value could grow to become over time. Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning its network is supported by thousands of independent nodes. Unlike fiat currencies, it isn't controlled by any single sovereign nation or tied to one economy. Bitcoin has never suffered a major hack, and is probably one of the safest, most liquid, and most tradeable stores of value that exists on the planet.

In short, the leading cryptocurrency has the attributes that make it an ideal currency in countries that lack a stable method of payment. It is a vessel for wealth for folks in developing and developed economies. It is also arguably a better inflation hedge than gold. Add it all up, and bitcoin has the potential to be worth more than any single company -- and could one day be worth more than the world's total gold supply (which is valued at roughly $10 trillion). And since it has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, about 19 million of which are already in circulation, bitcoin prices won't have to fight inflation effects.

Few investment opportunities offer a feasible long-term gain of 1,000%. Bitcoin is one of them. And considering it's finally back down to the low $50,000 range, it could be time for investors to start a small position and dollar-cost average into bitcoin.

Getting selective in the stock market
A lot of growth companies have seen their share prices downright annihilated in recent months. So when investors glance at an index like the S&amp;P 500 or the Nasdaq-100 and notice both are still up big for the year, they may scratch their heads. The reasoning is because these indexes are market-cap weighted, meaning the large companies contribute the bulk of gains and losses. And this year, the largest companies are all doing quite well.

For example, the 10 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 50% year-to-date, and they make up nearly one-third of the index.

As a group, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia are crushing the market this year. Collectively, they make up -- wait for it -- over 60% of the Nasdaq 100 index. This is all to say that until these companies suffer major declines, stock indexes can only go down so much.

Unlike the crypto market, where buying the largest names seems like the best all-around option, you could argue that the opposite is true in the U.S. stock market. Companies like Apple have hinted at declining demand for new iPhones, supply chain challenges, and slowing growth. And yet, investors have flocked to its stock as a place of safety amid market volatility, ignoring cracks in the company itself. Therefore, blue-chip companies like Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) or PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) that are down over 35% from their highs (but offer plenty of long-term upside) seem like better all-around buys.

Combining safety, value, and growth
To answer the general question of whether it's better to take advantage of the crypto crash or the stock market sell-off, I would actually argue the crypto crash is a better buy -- Bitcoin and Ethereum are down a lot from their highs but they have so much growth ahead. However, if the question is whether it's better to buy crypto or certain blue-chip stocks, I would say blue-chip stocks that have already sold off are going to make more sense for most investors.

We discussed Disney and PayPal, but there is actually a long list of strong industry-leading companies that are down 20% or more from their highs. From dividend and value stocks like Lockheed Martin to downtrodden leaders in attractive industries like cybersecurity or the gig economy, the market is ripe with buying opportunities outside of the largest tech stocks. 

As with all investment decisions, it's important to select the companies or cryptos that best fit your risk tolerance so you're eligible for the right amount of reward for the amount of risk you are comfortable accepting.

I see a lot of talk on here comparing investments in crypto and stocks, and which one is more favourable..

I gotta throw it out there that they need to be looked at differently and I dont think you can favour one or the other. 

Obviously there is the volatility and high risk high reward nature of cryptocurrency that many are drawn to, and others the future of both transactions and storing wealth.

But stocks you are actually investing in something with capital. One thing that sparked my concern even though I am an avid crypto enthusiast is I was looking at Royal Caribbean Cruises (which I am a shareholder) and they have a Market Cap of $19.2B less than CRO and Matic and Shiba and they have the capital to back it up..

I dunno, scares me when I see some comparing the two

Hi all, just had a quick question about Certik audits.

https://www.certik.org/projects/elvantis

Im interested in the above project due to launch soon, but its a little bit suspicious. However, Certik is seen as the holy grail of audits. Its expensive and takes a while, but its seen as one of the best.

The project is due to have a private sale today on their own website but my concern is that the audit hasnt come back yet (its currently been onboarded by Certik), and they may do the private sale, scam investors and vanish all before the Certik audit comes back and lets people know its not safe.

When a project has been onboarded by Certik, what does that mean? Simply that a request has put in? Ive also heard rumours that to even be considered for a Certik audit, you must KYC with them. How true is that?

I've noticed several posts about new token that was born from the representative Sherman's quote 

 

&gt;"The number one threat to cryptocurrency is crypto. Bitcoin could be displaced by Ether, which could be displaced by Doge which could be displaced by HamsterCoin and then there's CobraCoin what could MongooseCoin do to CryptoCoin?"

Since then a token emerged called GOOSE. According to Bogtools it went up a lot. Telegram pump and dump groups are already on it. This wont end well for the investors. 

Instead of chasing geese with this, I urge you to remember what happened to SQUID and other shitcoins that emergen from the void like this one did.

Don't get fooled. By investing into a solid project you aren't only doing yourself a favor but the community of crypto in whole. 

  
Stay safe and keep away from tokens like these

Just in case you are not aware, Evergrande has just defaulted as it was expected. 
We did know that this was coming in, just wondering, if we are going to do the normal panic thingy, then drop  maybe 20 % or can we just for once get over it and just continue our way up? As I'm writing this the market already  started bleeding.. I guess here we go again please wake me up in January.

It is really hard to understand , even that we knew this was happening  how it would still affect the market that much? Don't you al get just sick of all the FUD around?

This is a slightly updated post on the one i made yesterday because as i researched more into this project i realised it was incorrect to call them Hyperverse. That's part of their efforts to disappear, and most others will know them as Hyperfund. 

They are actively deleting everything they can right now. Their Whitepaper has gone, so has their Github if they ever had one. 


Formerly HyperFund. They've just name changed. I haven't done a deep dive here as it doesn't look to be necessary. Its a Ponzi scheme with extra steps.

Looks like they are creating tons of shit tokens and then requiring you to reinvest part of your money into their shit token. so all the tokens in the ecosystem are created by them. This means that their shit tokens look good to outside investors who see their prices going up, as you have no choice but to reinvest in them. That returns the profits which they are giving out to you to encourage you to invest more and bring friends in.


The issue here is that these shit-tokens you have to invest in have no actual value. As soon as outside investors realise this and decide they want to take their money out everything will come crashing down like a house of cards. Multiple governments have picked up on this and issued warnings.


Over the last few months [India](https://behindmlm.com/companies/hyperfund-under-regulatory-investigation-in-india/), [the UK](https://behindmlm.com/companies/hyperfunds-homepage-added-to-fca-securities-fraud-warning/), [New Zealand](https://behindmlm.com/companies/hyperfund-securities-fraud-warning-issued-in-new-zealand/), [Guernsey](https://behindmlm.com/companies/hyperfund-securities-fraud-warning-issued-by-guernsey/), [Germany](https://behindmlm.com/companies/hyperfund-under-investigation-in-germany-for-securities-fraud/) and [Bermuda](https://behindmlm.com/mlm/regulation/hyperfund-ponzi-scam-warning-issued-by-bermuda-police/), have all taken regulatory action against HyperFund.

[https://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/hyperfund](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/hyperfund)

[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency-hyper-fund-under-government-scanner/articleshow/86316428.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency-hyper-fund-under-government-scanner/articleshow/86316428.cms)

  
Here's a list of their distinguished guests at their latest event: [https://imgur.com/a/ECJccCw](https://imgur.com/a/ECJccCw)

1) Their founder Ryan Xu has just disappeared and didn't attend. His previous Crypto projects have collapsed losing all their investors money:  https://rorysinghreviews.com/hyperfund-blockchain-global-collapses/

In addition to Blockchain Global liquidation, victims of Xus and Lees ACX scheme are suing for over $10 million in losses. ACX was a crypto investment scheme launched through Blockchain Global. It collapsed in February 2020.

By that stage Xu and Lee had created HyperTech and launched the HyperCapital Ponzi scheme.

HyperCapital collapsed in mid 2020, prompting HyperTech to launch HyperFund.

After HyperFund we have Hyperverse, an NFT Ponzi scheme hiding behind a space-themed video game.

Its basically a list of ponzi scheme after ponzi scheme created by Xu



2) Their new CEO Steven Reece Lewis, touted as a business expert doesn't exist outside of one video created by Hyperverse. He has no linkedin, no twitter, no mention of him on the board of any previous companies.

3) Grig Richters doesn't appear to exist, at least not one with any public connection to Hyperverse/Hyperfund.  


4) Chris Hector.. barely exists: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-hector-806a47226/?originalSubdomain=my](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-hector-806a47226/?originalSubdomain=my)  


That's an entire line up of non-existent people they've put together. The lack of effort makes me think they are close to pulling the rug. 


There's a pretty good break down here:

1. [https://behindmlm.com/mlm-reviews/hyperfund-review-hypertech-now-a-ponzi-shitcoin-factory/](https://behindmlm.com/mlm-reviews/hyperfund-review-hypertech-now-a-ponzi-shitcoin-factory/)
2. [https://behindmlm.com/companies/hyperfund/hyperverse-affiliates-instructed-to-destroy-hyperfund-evidence/](https://behindmlm.com/companies/hyperfund/hyperverse-affiliates-instructed-to-destroy-hyperfund-evidence/)
3. [https://behindmlm.com/companies/hyperfund/hyperfund-withdrawals-disabled-hypertechs-new-boris-ceo/](https://behindmlm.com/companies/hyperfund/hyperfund-withdrawals-disabled-hypertechs-new-boris-ceo/)


Destroying evidence. A new CEO no-one's ever heard of before. A disappearing founder. Unfortunately I think the bubble is about to burst.


The recent name change is because they are attracting bad reviews which means people will stop being duped and they are near that one big collapse. They've also picked a name already taken by a legitimate project working in a similar area, which they must know they are going to fail to keep. Either that's just being lazy as they are pulling out as fast as possible, or they are hoping to confuse people looking into it. 

This Hyperverse doesn't have anything to do with the [Hyperverse being built by Decentology](https://www.decentology.com/hyperverse), which is a different team and appears to be trying to build a legit product. I couldn't find any links. I think HyperFund have just switched their name to Hyperverse and probably messed up all the other teams marketing and dirtied their name, which sucks. 

Credit to BehindMLM.com who have been following this the whole time and have a more in depth write up than i've made.

The music industry has been in a state of *upheaval* for the past decade. The arrival of streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music has disrupted conventional models, bringing artists to a broader audience while eroding profit margins for labels and musicians. Artists are becoming frustrated with unfair **royalty rates**, limited resources for marketing, and data mining by third-party companies that profit from their hard work.

Now, we're starting to see a similar effect with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.**NFTs**are a new technology that could potentially be applied to the problem of making music**profitable**again.

What if **Fractional Ownership (**in F-NFT) could be the solution?

Hi everyone!

I have a tax related question for any US expats that are on this sub. I live in the UK and have recently started dipping my feet into crypto. I wanted to ask how other US expats are handling their crypto gains with the IRS, particularly any % earned from staking. I'm not too worried about capital gains on sales at the moment as I plan on holding for the long term. 

It's really important to me to make sure I'm doing this the right way with the taxman, but that I'm also being efficient and making the most of any loopholes etc. Afaik, gains from staking are taxed as Misc Income by HMRC in the UK. However, because the income itself isn't 'earned' I believe that I cannot claim it under the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion with the IRS.   


I've never used the Foreign Tax Credits (FTC) before, but would that be the most efficient way of claiming this?  


Or could I claim any staking income under my standard deduction with the IRS, while still paying tax on it in the UK?  


If you've run into any other quirks buying/selling/dealing with crypto as a US expat abroad, feel free to drop it in the comments below.   


Thanks!

Hi not sure if anyone will be able to advise on this.. I think this was a pretty dumb move by me, given that I'll scoff sometimes at how people get scammed.

I was part of a community where everyone was invited into a particular channel last night, after which there was a bot asking us to join a "potential" giveaway. After typing /join in the chat, the bot PM-ed each of us, sending us a link which will direct us to a website with options to link our wallets. I selected Metamask and was directed to the Metamask login, with the logo and everything seemingly legit. The security logo at the site information was also secured. I tried to log in using my password, and it even prompted me to enter my secret phrase key, but I just couldn't sign in. After several attempts and verifying that my secret phrase key was indeed correct, it only dawned on me that this could be a phishing website.

I have since changed my Metamask password, been checking my Metamask wallet since yesterday and my stuff are still intact inside, but just wondering if I should create a new wallet and transfer them out. Since the website is likely to be a phishing website which has my secret phrase key now.

I originally wrote this as a comment, but got buried, so I figured I'd share it as a post.

Intuitively, it seems like having a bunch of other RCPs is really bad for us, because it will just make moons less scarce and dilute our value. But is that really true? 

I've thought about this for quite a while now, and I believe that it isn't. Here are some of my top reasons:

1. If there was only a single reddit coin, it wouldn't be worth a mere 9-10 mil. It would be worth billions, if not tens of billions. Reddit has 400M+ active monthly users. Assuming even half of them participate in RCPs when Reddit opens them up to all subs, that's 200M+ holders of reddit RCPs. **that's more than the number of either BTC or ETH holders**. 

2. So we've established that the total value of reddit RCPs should be **much greater** than it is now, especially when Reddit does more with the ecosystem, like NFT auctions and such. And by the virtue of there being hundreds of millions of users with reddit RCPs, **there will be other devs looking for opportunity and develop DApps around the RCP ecosystem, just as there are devs developing for ETH, Shib, SOL, etc**, creating even more value.

3. Moons will likely be the largest, at least one of the largest RCPs for the following reasons:

- Moons have a huge early mover advantage. Look at BTC. It's way behind in terms of tech, yet it is by far the biggest crypto because of early mover advantage.

- Besides all the traditional benefits of an early mover advantage, there's also an additional huge benefit here, because moons have already been around for over a year, **the inflation schedule of moons will be far lower than the inflation schedule of new RCPs**. Because we see that the inflation scale is on a logarithmic curve; inflation is far greater at the beginning. This means that there is a lot less additional coins being minted to moons than other RCPs, making it much easier to appreciate in value, even assuming all else is equal.

- r/cc is one of the largest subs on the entire platform with over 4 million subscribers. Additionally, we have anywhere from 10k-30k active members at any moment. Compared to extremely large subs like r/worldnews with 27 million subs which still only has 16k active members at the time of my comment, and r/TIL with 26.5M subs but only 7.7k active members at the time of my comment, you see that r/cc really is among the largest of subs.

- r/cc is a crypto sub, THE largest crypto community in the world, in fact. This is huge, for obvious reasons because, well, RCP is crypto and you'd expect the crypto enthusiasts to make the most of it. But other than that, there's a huge difference in the **quality of communities**. Take YouTube, for example, it's something I'm familiar with. Gaming channels and entertainment channels like MrBeast might get a lot of views, but the value of those views is very low. Most gaming channels have a lower revenue than $1 RPM. This means they earn less than $1 per 1000 views. Compared this, to financial YouTube channels like GrahamStephan, Meetkevin, AndreiJikh, etc, they make up to $10-$30 RPM. Financial content is by far one of the most valuable on the internet, and obviously cryptocurrencies are financial products, so having a community of crypto enthusiasts in itself is worth a lot more than say r/fortnitebr, a place filled with a bunch of kids who don't have money.

Yes after carefully crafting the title out of the idea that i heard my friends btching ab the fact that i use too much spice in my food and it smells the kitchen (well f you, it is food, it is kitchen, it is supposed to smell) I think i have the perfect time for some discussion.



No this isn't about spices. This is about diversity in a portfolio. I am a fan of having multiple corvettes and not just the 2 battleships. what is wrong with me with all these analogies today. idk, im sorry.



START HERE: Most of us have more than btc and eth, and it is perfectly fine. However some of us have way more than initially planned. I mean, i never thought id have &gt;60 different tokens, i am feeling that you might resonate. I am planning to reduce the variety of tokens that i have, however i lack one huge technical ability for it.


I'd like to see how much further the coins that i have can gain, or where they are currently im their life cycle.


So far i've managed to get .csv file of all my buy/sell/deposit/transfer/stake but damn, I AM SURE there must be a way to combine the 4 excel sheets i have and see the average price i bought of every coin, along with the profit/loss with percentage and fiat.



TLDR: got many coins, made profit from some, perhaps not much from others, want to see how i did in total, coins that i profited from would get sold the most, coins that i didn't profit or lost would get re-evaluated (what caused my personal loss, me or the project) and proceed appropriately upon re-evaulation.


thank you, (id post my results if i can figure out so we can all see what happened this year. My results would be helpful i guess because a) why not? b) im not here to shill a coin.)

We are nearing the end of 2021 and Reddit has recently released the 2021 Recap. When I first clicked on it I have to say that even though I know crypto was one of the most trending and quickly rising communities, I was surprised to see a lot of it in the Recap 2021. Meme coins may have been the leading factor but as long as they act as a bridge to other projects, I'm perfectly fine with it!

You can check out the recap here \[Reddit in 2021\]([https://np.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/rbqu7c/reddit\_recap\_2021/](https://np.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/rbqu7c/reddit_recap_2021/))

&amp;#x200B;

As far as cryptocurrencies go, the most upvoted post in cryptocurrencies was  \[You hear about the kid who put in $500 into a memecoin and made 100k, but you don't hear about the hundreds who put $1000 and are left with $0.1\]([https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n7rl2y/you\_hear\_about\_the\_kid\_who\_put\_in\_500\_into\_a/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n7rl2y/you_hear_about_the_kid_who_put_in_500_into_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) leading with crazy 53.9K upvotes.

&amp;#x200B;

I was pretty conservative in terms of bullishness but this gave me a real boost. We are still so early. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's fantastic to see that so many new people are entering this space which was a few years only whispered around. According to \[[mashable.com](https://mashable.com)\]([https://mashable.com](https://mashable.com)),  Reddit has seen 6.6 million mentions of crypto  across the platform. With  **430 million** active users on Reddit, we are the best marketing campaign for crypto there ever was. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im pretty sure that shit bull run has barely just begun.

I oftentimes see posts on this sun that have like 10-100 upvotes but already 300+ comments. The reason for that is obviously farming for MOONs. A lot of the people who comment will comment for the hope of gaining some moons rather than contributing something like information or a joke (think the classic single word comment bullish). 
Now while in my opinion any kind of engagement is still good, it got me thinking if this sub would be still as popular as it is now without the premise of being able to earn money from it. 
Same question stands for wether or not people would still so actively comment on posts if it wasnt for the possibility to make some crypto.

So I used to be really really down bad. I was 20 and had literally $5 to my name in January 2021. I felt helpless and didn't know how to get my bread right. I was already planning to buy this sneaker or this watch, when in reality I couldn't even afford a fraction of the things I wanted. After the DOGE hype during April-May I began to invest, I started with $120, it doesn't sound a lot, but it's still something. During the lil crash in May I thought it was the end of my investment, but by watching a couple YT videos and doing my own research I understood that a correction is healthy for the market, so I survived a couple dips and DCA'd. Now I'm 21 and have over $1200 in my crypto-portfolio. This was only possible by not spending too much money on things I don't even need, I did one stupid purchase though (bought myself YEEZYs for $300, which I regret a lot, but I think it's okay to spoil ourselves, eh?). In a week or two I'll be able to invest another $2300 (50% ETH, 40% ALTS and 10% DOGE). I never would have thought, that I'd have a crypto-portfolio worth over $3500+, but I did it. I'd like to thank myself for not giving up, thank the crypto yters, that kept it real and especially thank y'all for spreading solid information in this sub !  Wish y'all a bullish week :)!

I started investing in crypto last year. Just an once-off small investment in BTC and ETH. I did not follow up after that, also did not check crypto news and charts. However, one month ago I received a letter from my bank that they will start charging me a negative interest rate because my savings have surpassed a certain threshold. So that got me thinking about new investments to get my savings below the threshold. As I wanted to diversify my investments I decided to do more in crypto this time. I did my own research, checked the projects, observed the charts on a daily basis, read the news, etc. for about 3 weeks until I decided to make it happen. So on Thur dec 2, I placed my investments (BTC, ETH, CRO, XRP, QNT, SOL). I was happy. Until the next day almost all crypto turned red and within 24hrs my portfolio was down 30%. I knew it would eventually recover which it almost has in the meantime. But Its just that my timing was so bad. If I had invested only a day later, my portfolio would be 30% up now. So I am asking myself if there is anything I could have done to anticipate that heavy dip. Any ideas or comments?

A few days ago I saw a post shilling a token called Hocus Pocus. It was obvious that the post was made by a bot because it was in a completely irrelevant sub and it was using the standard cryptomoonshots spam template. 

It was supposed to launch later that day, so i figured I was early enough to make some quick profit. 

I visited their site and joined their discord. The discord was pretty dead, pretty much 20 people talking and half of them were saying the token was looking sus.

The website had a couple typos, and the whitepaper of the token was shitty. It did not mention anything other than tokenomics. When the dev was asked about the use case of Hocus he said he was planning on making a game similar to defi kingdoms but did not elaborate on how Hocus would be relevant. I assume he had not thought of the possibility of people asking him about it. When asked (again) about the use case of Hocus he replied that the community will vote on it. 

Despite all the red flags, I still wanted to buy. I figured i'd only spend $5 on it as a gamble.

I bought some as soon as it was listed on a dex. I saw my $5 turn into $10 and sold as fast as I could. 

Then I started paying attention to the discord again. 

A bunch of people were complaining about not being able to sell. The dev said he'd look into it but then stopped replying. Apparently the dev was able to change the token's contract to prevent people from selling. 

A few minutes later the discord, the website, and the reddit posts were all deleted, confirming that it was indeed a scam. 

Honestly it was quite fun, more fun than spending that $5 betting on sports.

Hi all,

I'm currently between two fronts: The gaming subs I'm subscribed to are raging about the recent announcement of Ubisoft to implement NFTs, while this sub is hailing it as a step towards wider adoptation.

As someone who hated the concept of microtransactions in games like everyone else and is still more of gamer than hardcore crypto trader, could you please explain to me why the move of Ubisoft could be positive for the gaming community and not just make more money for the people trading in NFTs (and the games publisher)?

Thanks!

There are so many choices on good cryptos to pick up and I was recently bought cardano while cheap as I thought that was a snag, Im starting to see that it quite was the opposite. As Ive seen barely any movement and a little bit of a downtrend. So I was wondering should I hold this cardano or sell it for something like quant, LRC or I was thinking dot would be an excellent pick?
If anyone has any good suggestions hit me as I would love to hear feedback on how I could set out my portfolio for some nice returns.

Over 9.6 million Americans have lost their jobs post pandemic and around 81 million labourers and employees lost their jobs in the Asia Pacific region. Massive layoffs just before the holiday season could also be the main catalyst to this crab market. 

The level uncertainty around the market has been mapping back to covid times. The mass resignations of exactly matches the start of the dip in the bull run we have been having. Employees between 30 and 45 years old have had the greatest increase in resignation rates, with an average increase of more than 20% between 2020 and 2021. While turnover is typically highest among younger employees, our study found that over the last year, resignations actually decreased for workers in the 20 to 25 age range (likely due to a combination of their greater financial uncertainty and reduced demand for entry-level workers). Interestingly, resignation rates also fell for those in the 60 to 70 age group, while employees in the 25 to 30 and 45+ age groups experienced slightly higher resignation rates than in 2020 (but not as significant an increase as that of the 30-45 group).

With new and younger investors entering the market and older one cashing out to sustain their livelihood, it could take quite sometime to exactly see how this pans out. With a new year just around the corner, let's hope it brings back Crypto market back on track to BTC 100k. Santa Sminem could also happen. So clean your chimney and hope for best.

Some people who prefer more stable savings should buy stocks instead.

Actually, I think in every financial portfolio, stocks should have a place. Not only does it secure your funds against extreme volatility that crypto can have, it also helps you learn the basics and pillars of finance, and therefore potentially improve your investment strategies in crypto as well.

On the other hand, when crypto goes up, it might easily touch the skies.

The point of this post is to make it known that diversification in crypto assets is great but a more secure/wise investment contains a few **types** of investments.

The 0.05% APY your bank gives you is a joke but your money there cannot vanish down to 50% in one night either.

Stocks don't reward you as much as crypto does but they educate you about the basics of the market and can act as a hedge against huge losses.

Every portfolio should contain BTC and/or ETH in my opinion, too, because those are the most reliable and least volatile assets in crypto (besides stablecoins of course and compared to "moonshot" altcoins).

So either diversify, or hold long term until you don't even care about short term losses.

...or leave crypto all together.

I get it that you can downvote someone for an offensive comment, or something off-topic trying to farm karma. Ok, I get it.

Downvoting everybody just for the sake of it is loser territory. Do you realize how many people you would need to downvote to earn an extra moon? Something you could easily earn by writing something nice or helpful instead. 

We are here because we have this common interest that is crypto. Just let us be. It is sad to see people having to delete their totally normal comments because they are getting downvoted for no apparent reason. 

And if you truly disagree with me or with anyone else, don't be the coward that downvotes without saying anything. Let's discuss and learn from one another. Let's respect opinions different from ours, and even agree to disagree in a polite way. Is this too much to ask for?

Literally watching BTC right now (as of posting this) on kucoin 5m chart.  HUGE single green dildo with the following red...(edit: as I re-read this before posting it seems that following red turned into small greens but zooming out to 4hr chart shows downtrend and more immediate crab.). We've been seeing lots of sudden dumps.  My point is there was a sudden spike in buys and relative downtrend from there.

I feel like since so many cex's and defi does leveraging now we have seen what happens...and how it favors the whales manipulation overall.  I'm only kind of bitching here, really just putting the thought out there.  Speaking what I'm thinking.  I could be totally wrong about all of this but we know whale manipulation happens. And with more and more leveraging coming to defi chains that suddenly become popular and onboarded...I sometimes question if crypto is ultimately more liberating from the division of wealth when the richest (in crypto) can still manipulate the market and also get retail poor(er) investors to leverage for "gainsX" and end up liquidated.  Seems more prominent recently.

Am I off base here?  I'm ok with that if I am.  Just honestly a thought I was having and wanted to share and get feedback on.  I am NOT fud with this.  Just something I've been seeing more of and thinking about how it plays out for good or bad.

Basically I'm noticing how defi is starting to get more leveraging protocols and wondering how that may be detrimental and ultimately mirroring the same system crypto is supposed to get away from.

I would normally chalk this up to "well maybe this is how it goes" but this same time last year had less chains being as popular and less leveraging protocols.  So I can't help but wonder...

Thoughts?

When somebody writes some emotional reddit post about a particular coin:

*"ABC coin" HIT All Time High of "XYZ" MILLION+ daily Transaction on Mainnet on this day for the first time,* ***this is the testament of global usage &amp; exponential growth*** **

Like no, it makes me want to puke. This only means that it had xyz daily transaction. That's all. This is the same level bullshit for me when they refer their company as their family. Like a 2 week old relationship which screams insecurity by always saying "Oh he is the best. I finally found him. Never been truly loved before."

Am I the only one who feel this way?

Governments as a whole arent the bad guys. Whats bad is the financial system running most governments.

As weve seen with things like DeFi, our money is capable of yielding much more than what banks and government backed financial systems offer us.

Which is why I think taxes should stay in order for a country to keep operating normally. However, it would be great if we broke from the grasps of government control over our other finances.

This is why I invest so much in DeFi like Algorand and Yearn to gain much better passive income and DAOs like BitDAO which will offer me governance power over a lot of DeFi projects since BitDAO holds the biggest treasury in all of the market, a whopping $3.13 Billion

How yall doing you beautiful people?

Back when I started investing in crypto around 2016-2017, I remember I felt a certain sense of control over the price of BTC. The reason for that was due to the fact that it felt easier to pinpoint what was influencing the price of BTC (and most alt-coins).

- A country banning crypto? (drop in price)
- Elon tweeting something positive crypto related (increase in price)

Nowadays it feels different, the runs and drops are not as easily explained by obvious factors. Often I see price movement without any (for me visible) underlying context. This does somewhat scare me, making investing in crypto feel a bit more like a casino then before (dont get me wrong, I am very bullish on the long-run unlike a casino). 

I wonder how you feel about this, and if other have similar reflections? Also, if it is true, what could be the reason for this change?

I sometimes wonder if its just me or a general thing. But i suppose i cant be the only one.

Since i started with investing into crypto currencies, i find that more and more my thoughts turn around it. I check my portfolio like 25 times per day, and i am no day trader, i hodl what i have (besides some shitcoins for fun). So there is really no need to check the price every 5 minutes, because i wont sell anyways and a good portion of the funds are in earn programs or staked. So even if i wanted to i couldn't t do anything if the market crashes. ok, sometimes i buy the dip if i get some dry powder left and the timing is right.

I even spend too much time on reddit to read about it and the same for YouTube where i try to stay up to date with certain projects and follow some channels for info (coinbureau, etc.). Even while i try to get some sleep my thoughts turn around what could happen and what i would do ...

Sometimes i think it would be really relaxing to just not open the apps to check where everything is at and just forget about everything for a month or two. But hell no! I am into crypto since the start of the year and never ever didn't check everything for a even a day.

I sometimes feel that it drives me mad. I certainly hope that i am not the only one in this case.

What are your experiences, and how do you cope with it?

I've been in crypto for 4 years. And by being in it i mean I've learned about it, bought it and sold it. Hodld and panicked. But i had not really used crypto as it was intended until one currency changed all that.

It started with a community token that recently launched on the Algo Blockchain. I bought it quite early and quickly got interested in trying more part of the Blockchain. And in the matter of 6 weeks I've used crypto more than i had in 4 years. I've minted NFTs, added to liquidity pool and even created an alt coin myself (ASA). I've joined the friendliest community for this token and spend a lot of time socializing with strangers.

So if you just like me have been investing in crypto but would also like to use crypto. Try algorand, it's really easy to use. Everything is simpler than you might have though.

I know this comes of as a big shill, and i supposed it is. I'm sure there are other Blockchains that allow you to do the same things but i doubt there's any that offer the ease that Algo did. Thanks for reading, hope to see you on the Blockchain!

Got 10k in the bank; did some thinking and decided to invest it into altcoins.

I've looked into BTC and ETH and I've decided to mainly focus on altcoins.  BTC is just out of reach along with ETH.

I ending up doing a little bit of reading on following coins.

Enjin / Luna / Avax / Sol / Matic

I am deciding between these though I really do like Enjin(ENJ).  Still need need to do a bunch of researching before making the call but at the same time I feel pretty good about those 5 mentioned.  Especially since the top10 on Coinmarketcap have changed and will probably change again next year.

Also I guess the other question is.  All of it in one coin? or split it up between the picks?  Either way is a risk.

Also made up my mind I'm okay with losing the 10k. Take it as a lessons learned about high risk investments.

I start thinking of that old song "it's raining men"
And twist it around in my head whenever I see new moons in my vault. 

*"ITS RAINING MOONS!... HALLELUJAH ITS RAINING MOONS!"*

I do a quick dance wherever I am.  At the job site, or at home in front of my hot wife. 

On my other account. I have about 55K moons and i since I got a new phone , I never bothered to sign in.  Just my alt account.  I was too lazy to farm anymore...but when that exploded after arbitrum announcement several months ago.....  I felt sexy

That's what they make me feel like.  When they go main, I will look sexy.

Hey everyone,

Relatively new to crypto. Although there have been a lot of questions answered already, I have one that I'm really curious about now. My current biggest question is as the title says. How much do bots run the market? 

The other part of this question is buy and sell orders. How much of an impact do limit and stop limit orders have on the market as a whole? 

Is there a way to see where people have orders placed? 
Or is there a skill in assuming where these buy/sell walls are, and buying or selling right before?


When it comes to this type of trading, either automatic or automated, how does it effect price action of the market at large?

Thank you for your insight!

Ive been researching and thinking about staking some coins for awhile now, and came across Midas Investments. At first, I was looking at just stablecoins like USDC and seeing Crypto.com at 12%, and then Midas with a whopping 19%. Then I looked at their site and they have somevery high rates for others as well

- 17% BTC
- 23% ETH
- 19% DAI

I justhow? 0_0 Thats way more than anybody else is offering, which makes me believe this is WAY too good to be true. So I was wondering if anybody on this subreddit has any experience with them or is currently using their platform can give any insight to how they work, and if they are truly legit?

There are two main strategies when it comes to investing your hard-earned money. Dollar-cost averaging and lump-sum buying. DCA is by far, the superior method to balance out **time** and **risk** while still making a substantial profit.

To begin with, you aren't exposed to situations like these:

* Not having any cash to buy during a bear cycle (which will give you the best returns)
* The emotions brought on by huge losses in a short period
* Failing to time the market

# How much time do you need to make $1M?

If you somehow managed to find the elixir that makes you live forever, you could almost guarantee wealth. We don't have that much time, most of us will live to 80 and everyone wants their investment to pay off well before that to enjoy the money they earned.

If you decided to take the boomer route and just invest in the overall growth of the economy without doing any work, you'd buy index funds and make 10.49% on average per year, as has been the case since 1921.

Below is an example of someone investing **$25,000** once and then waiting 36 years.

https://preview.redd.it/6xjr7yprcg481.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e08867bf866874f6cf106e471e012089d0c2197

Don't want to wait 36 years? Well, that brings us to the next variable, risk.

# Risk

As you increase the risk of your investment, you decrease the time it takes for it to pay off. Let's put that **$25,000** into DOGE at the end of 2020.

https://preview.redd.it/yhrzxu2eeg481.png?width=757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b2adc3dbeb7b73bedb78ff341ea66d76161653f

Much better! But to call that a risky investment would be an understatement. How would you have known that out of all the tokens in existence, DOGE would be one of the best performers. When you imagine actually investing in DOGE back then, you'd likely be asking yourself these questions:

* It's dropped by 50% before, am I ready to stomach a $12,500 loss?
* Should I sell now that my investment has already doubled?
* Do I buy a house now that my investment has turned into $400,000?

You'll never see an upvoted post showing off a 40% loss. Nor will you see a post of someone losing all their money through a token that went to zero. You only see the winners and not the 90% of losers. This is called survivorship bias. 

All the stories you hear about insane profits lead you to believe that most people are getting these returns, which is false. Think about how many people had to lose money and buy near the top for that one person to make a 5240% profit.

Reducing risk can be done through diversification and unfortunately minimizing your potential return by picking tokens with less room to grow but with a higher chance of sustained growth.

# Knowledge

Not many people believe they know something others don't and even fewer actually do. You can't accurately value a cryptocurrency like you would a business. There's no balance sheet and minimal proven metrics you can use to predict price movement.

There are also factors that are out of your control. Short-term price fluctuations are definitely out of your control, they are governed by early adopters, exchanges, unpredictable news, and government regulations.

**Well, what do we know?**

Nothing for certain, but it's pretty easy to see that the cryptocurrency market will only grow as institutions, governments, and citizens realize that blockchain technology, smart contracts, and other functions of crypto add value to society.

I've seen posts from people who believe they deserve 100% returns in a month without doing any research. Investing is a long game and you acquire knowledge along the way. 

# A middle ground

Let's say that **$25,000** was invested in Bitcoin divided up into monthly intervals for the past 5 years.

https://preview.redd.it/f6frvpwljg481.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83d71c145bb9f649a2d3d653772fe87223ba3f25

If you were this person, you didn't have to risk $25,000 with no proof that your investment would pay off, but you still made a ton of money. Time in the market beats timing the market and dollar-cost averaging is the best way to do this.

I've had a look at the relevant law, the Securities Act of 1933, and cannot see how this is going remotely well for Ripple. The definition of a security is pretty clearly exactly what crypto is, and the law says sale of securities must be declared. The court has previously said no to narrowing the definition of a security, and the reasons they might narrow the definition of a security aren't applicable to crypto (other laws superseded the current ones etc.). The exemptions to register sales don't apply here either. I cannot see how this case is going  well for Ripple, but I'm not terribly into crypto so am looking for some insight into why so many people think the case is going well/a guaranteed win. I don't have very much experience with crypto but am studying law, so have a decent grasp of the legislation.

All of us joined crypto for whatever reason, your story or mine doesn't matter as much as the fact that most of us here want a better financial shot or chance. Crypto has proven a viable option towards a ' financial  reset ' that many of us never thought we'd have.

So read and learn as much about the technology as you can, humans are all unique. You may end up stumbling upon the next x1000 and while everyone is laughing at you, you just plug away and wake up to millions one fateful morning.

There is a lot of noise in this market, technical analysis, charts, opinions and ' experts. ' Nothing will ever beat your own mind and intuition. Why? Because you alone know your situation, you know what you need and your heart and mind will guide you towards it if you focus and research stuff you feel has potential.

Something may just pop up and who knows maybe you ride into the sunset within the next couple of years a fresh millionaire.

I'm trying to recover my Metamask wallet which had both a hot account and a hardware connected account.  Using my safe/offline/never shared seed phrase, I'm able to recover the Metamask wallet with the hot account but I can't seem to find the appropriate account for the hardware wallet.

Clicking "Connect Hardware Wallet" and going through the Trezor steps does bring up a list of available accounts but the one I'm missing is not listed.

Here is the address of the account on Etherscan:  
[https://etherscan.io/address/0x91ed3399d9b3bb2878a03fa6ff7d06badfea1887](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91ed3399d9b3bb2878a03fa6ff7d06badfea1887)

My problem is basically identical to the thread shown here:  
[https://community.metamask.io/t/how-i-recovery-hardware-wallet-on-metamask/6347](https://community.metamask.io/t/how-i-recovery-hardware-wallet-on-metamask/6347)

The Metamask thread above mentions derivation paths which I'm trying to research and learn as much as possible about but my hope is that the solution is much easier/simpler.

Thanks in advance for the help!

Well they did the rug pull today screwing recent investors.  This is why crypto will suffer until people who do this kind of stuff are held accountable.

Personally I think prison is too good.  I also think services like Telegram should be held accountable for helping facilitate.  

I know people will try to say how is Telegram responsible?  Well when you allow admins ban conversations when the words such as scam, ponzi, scheme etc.

If Telegram can turn a blind eye then they are culpable.  

People will so say do your research but they flat out lied on their website.

We have seen a lot of debate about the uprising of so-called Memecoins. Tokens which seemingly do not have inherent value or a specific use case, or serious ambition at all. The most notable example of this would be Dogecoin. A coin seemingly created as a joke, but rising sharply in value. But why is that? 

Note that this is my personal opinion and interpretation. Im not stating this as a truth. Im curious what your opinions are about this subject. 

Now there are people claiming that one coin holds inherent value, more so than others. A Bitcoin may have more value than a Monero. A Litecoin should have more value than a Dogecoin, right? But I think in this particular reasoning, something is missing. The value of a currency is basically nothing but the social acceptance of its value. A Bitcoin may be worth $25.000 because we deem it so. A Dogecoin may be worth $1 because we think people will buy it for that. Of course we know tokens which are backed by a product. A good example is Ethereum or BAT. They have working products, with the token as some kind of incentive / market currency within. These edge along the regions of assets / securities with their own playground. 

A euro isnt better than a dollar. Nor is a yen inferior to Kenyan shillings. Said currency gains traction (long ago) in the market as the accepted form of value transfer. The exact value reaches a certain equilibrium in regular circumstances. There are plenty of currency instabilities to mention here, even in the fiat world. But know that central banks have the task of regulating the monetary market, by manipulating supply and demand to keep price volatilities at bay.

So, what do you think about this? Does every token need a product or solution to a problem? Or is being a socially accepted currency enough?

I started using crypto ecosystem with DOT, and I feel amazing using polkadot.js, it looked complicated at first but the learning curve wasn't too steep, once your familia with the UI everything work great. I can do crowdloan, I can stack my DOTs. I truly believed Crypto is the future.

Then yesterday I stupidly bought LRC and tried to transfer it to their wallet (I follow the guide on their website) believed it would be fine (I also use ALGO wallet and their DApp, which works good). And now my LRC is being held hostage in Metamask. I actually bought ETC to pay gas fees to get my coins back then transection failed I lost $50 for nothing and felt like I was scammed. (I didn't want to transfer my coins to LRC wallet anymore because the gas fees was even bigger). And I believe not only me got their money held hostage this. way.

ETH ecosystem are far far from user friendly and unreliable. If I started with ETH ecosystem I would have a really bad impression with the whole crypto space.

Please don't tell me L2 is the answer because to active my L2 wallet I have to transfer it through ETH layer one.

So basically ETH is only for price speculation, buy and hold in exchange. not for average people to use it ecosystem, except you're rich.

  With the upsurge of tokens, coins and blockchain, I see a lot of companies piggybacking on blockchain technology. This has highly saturated the market and seems like most project are solely built off of hype and their technology offers little to no inherent benefit to the alternative. 
  I have to ask do we really need this many coins, tokens for porn, charity, shopping? I feel like with the amount of cryptocurrencies floating around, it is a hinderance to mass adoption. 
  In my honest opinion, there should be a few key cryptos and not every platform needs their own token or coin.

Back for a quick guide on how to do your own research :

**coinmarketcap/coingecko**

First  thing I do is Coinmarketcap or coingecko . if the coin have mooned  several thousand percent and crashed at any point in time its usually a  big red flag for me .

The king of that metric would be BTC/ETH constant gain over the longest term

**Coin or Token**

token are easily minted so I give them extra screening especially bsc ones

**Website/whitepaper**

Proceed  to take a quick look at their website and white paper most serious  project have a well-made video or presentation to explain their utility  and problem there are solving

**Development**

Then I head to GitHub this is a MAJOR one for me. I look at the activity commits/code frequency/contributor

If this metric is low its a MAJOR redflag for me there is a few exception like project that do not rely on heavy dev

The kings of that metric would be ETH/cardana/polkadot/solana

**Use**

Blockchain  explorer and on-chain metric going to be your friend here if very  little uses the project or adoption is not going upward and marketcap is  already high this is a HUGE red flag , I use most of the project Im  invested into on weekly or daily basis (defi,transfer,ects)

osmosis,rayduim,tinyman,traderjoe ... i use them all

Why would you gamble/invest in a project you dont even use/like yourself?!

The king of this metric is Solana with 66M transaction daily

**TRY IT**

that would be my last step throw in a few $$ and try it see if you like it . UI good ? fees? speed ?

**Conclusion**

Now  you have to compare what is comparable. Cannot compare on-chain metric  of a micro-cap with Solana that would be silly, if the project you are  looking into is well above in every metric comparable to project within  the same MCAP you most likely found a long term winner.

So for those of you who doesn't know. Ubisoft (a major game publisher) is taking a step into the NFT market and linking it to their games. They are calling it Ubisoft Quartz. You can check out the site here [https://quartz.ubisoft.com/](https://quartz.ubisoft.com/)

The first game (test) that they are using is Tom Clancys Ghost Recon Breakpoint (released in 2019 and sells for $60 now). This in general isn't a super popular game and basically there is a rumor on Ubisoft ditching Ghost Recon or finding ways to spend less money and time on it. So basically, they are seeing if NFT will bring in extra sells where is needed as a test. Otherwise they could easily get rid of everything if needed.

Because it is only open to 1 game right now, this is the requirements [https://quartz.ubisoft.com/faq/requirements/who-can-acquire-digits](https://quartz.ubisoft.com/faq/requirements/who-can-acquire-digits)

(The NFT they are calling Digits)

# Free

Assuming you meet the requirements you can get 3 free NFT (some gun, helmet, and pants)

https://preview.redd.it/piqw0tcq5g481.png?width=1476&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=010afdd4ffa118db444b0cfe97635bbc42800af8

In the game you will be able to use the items

https://preview.redd.it/xx9a82p36g481.png?width=835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31a9281c2bdecd5bf06040b91871830db62d25fe

and sell them

And you can use them on your wallet. Remember not your keys not your crypto. I don't have this game, but am looking at picking it up to see where this goes. But I do wonder if it works with hardware wallets like Ledger.

# The nasty

* We don't know if they are going to kill this off after. Keep in mind, this is more than less a test. But lets assume this will pass whatever test and keep going to other games
* In theory you can use another NFT market as long as it takes Tezos NFT. But we don't know of any downside to this if there is even a Tezos NFT market out there. So you really could be stuck on their platform to sell your NFT if you want.
* Chances are is you will never make any money on an NFT outside if it's super rare and people for whatever really want it. At best instead of losing $10 on an NFT you never will use again, you just like $3 type of thing because the sell made up the difference.
* Since the sell is on the blockchain, you seriously need to check your tax laws in your area.
* There is no word at all if and when NFT will be used in a new games or have any other ability. Meaning when the game dies, so does any use for the NFT could die. This is assuming you can't use it in other games.
* There is no word on if it is possible for the NFT to work with games outside of Ubisoft. Like in theory it should work if a game allows it. But legally, will Ubisoft allow it. More than less the other game will be just reading some NFT which most likely a few lines of code. This telling the game to load whatever thing. And this means in the game itself the thing that represents the NFT has to be animated. Meaning any 3rd party game might run into legal problems with artwork or other things.
* If you can't transfer it to games outside of Ubisoft, then there is a high high high likely that it being on the blockchain is pointless outside of the cool factor and maybe easy to sell. But outside of that, it's basically could just as well be some items attached to your account on their servers.
* There isn't any word if this will be just more micro-transaction type of thing or a play to earn thing. Like will the only way to get NFT is by paying for them/getting them as gifts from other players, or will you be able to also earn some by doing stuff in the game.

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR

Ubisoft is test driving their new NFT thing. But you need to have Tom Clancys Ghost Recon Breakpoint, and meet a few other requirements to get a few free NFT. We could see this expand to other games, but there is no word on that yet. You can put the NFT on your own wallet, and you can sell the NFT. There is no word if they will regularly do a play to earn or if this is another money grab.

&amp;#x200B;

# My opinion

I honestly think it is interesting and hope it does become popular. Not so much for Ubisoft to have a money grab. But this can skyrocket the chances of things we been talking about with the metaverse. Where you will be able to transfer stuff between games, publishers, and other things. Like in RL if AR glasses were popular and the tech was there. I could see a floating thing in my room of the gear I got as an NFT from games I earned with it. Or if some indie game wanted to, they could let us transfer stuff from other games to it.

Now with that being said. Realistically I don't see this going far due to the culture around these big gaming companies. That and how it is tied only to 1 random game that already has been out for 2 years. And because of this, I don't think anyone should be going into this thinking they will make a ton or any money from this. Like you might here xyz streamer making a ton. But it's the same problem that is in the NFT market now. Where you have people buying it due to the person who is selling it and not due to the product. And chances are is if you just stop being tomorrow. Outside of family, friends, and a handful of others. No one would generally care or noticed. Meaning you shouldn't ever compare a famous person's success to you.

Traci and Dave Gagnon met in the cloud, so it only made sense that their wedding took place in it. On Labor Day weekend, the couple or rather, their digital avatars - held a ceremony staged by Virbela, a company that builds virtual environments for work, learning and events.

Ms. Gagnon's avatar was walked down the aisle by the avatar of her close friend. Mr. Gagnon's avatar watched as his buddy's avatar ambled up to the stage and delivered a toast. And 7-year-old twin avatars (the ring bearer and flower girl) danced at the reception.

I am relatively new in crypto industry. My financial background is stocks. Because I mostly play a long game, there is very little sensation in the process. I barely check my account. So I decided to give crypto a try.

I went deeper into the rabbit whole and began forming my very first crypto portfolio. I was overwhelmed how fast and volatile this industry can be. Everything can change in a matter of seconds and there are no weekends to get some rest either. I took it as challenge and started checking my phone whenever I had a chance throughout the day.

Fast forward another week. I realized that I was missing valuable data when I go to sleep. I looked up and practiced unihemispheric slow-wave sleep to allow half of my brain to rest while the other half stayed active. This significantly boosted my gains. 

Decided to create an account on Reddit to exchange ideas on how to transplant snake eyes and stop blinking. 

Shortly after reddit, left hemisphere lost control and traded everything for SafeSquid Shih Tzu. 

Now I am in recovery. Snake eyes got swollen.

My wife bought this stupid heat radiation suit on ebay which renders her invisible if she is not moving. I dont know if she left me or watching my every move! 

Also my dick goes up every time I hear my neighbors flute.

Okay, so we have all heard by now that former Google CEO, Eric Schmidt, has joined Chainlink ($LINK) as a strategic advisor...

If this has been answered, I apologize in advance.

A lot of people are excited about this and Chainlink did well today following the news. I, however, am worried by this. As we all know, Google is the furthest company from a decentralized platform. Decentralization is one of the most important aspects of a project for me personally and I refuse to invest in a company that isn't planning to stay decentralized. 

Does anyone else have this same fear or am I just overthinking it?

I was reading a post on the ImmutableX subreddit about someone who had copied and pasted the wrong address - do you guys use a tool to prevent something like this?

I've also been really paranoid about NFT minting because if you sign on the transaction carelessly they can empty your wallet. Is there some kind of software that would help me protect against this?

These scams also seem to be getting really sophisticated - there are a number of NFT scam accounts on Twitter that list them and how they get your assets. I also did some research and came across [bitsCrunch.com](https://bitscrunch.com/) that offer value estimation of NFTs and I would like to know further on how such systems work until the price is determined

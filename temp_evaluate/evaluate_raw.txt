#Basically there is a new technology/approach to smart contracts. Its off-chain scriptless scripts, and its gonna invalidate many seemingly big players in the market in the long term. Read on if youre curious what they are and how they work.

## Off-chain scriptless scripts to the best of my current knowledge are a solution to privacy and scalability issues with growing smart contract capable blockchains such as Ethereum and Terra.

Basically, the concept is that normally, smart contracts are stored and processed on the blockchain itself, implemented usually using a Turing complete language such as Ethereums Solidity, or Python and JS on Terra. For off-chain scriptless scripts, the smart contracts and protocols are created and stored off chain with whatever programming language a developer wants to use, as the blockchain doesnt need to know what the contract or protocol is, but rather just that the obligations of a contract have been met to execute payments. This is a simplified explanation of what this is.

So what does this mean for blockchains that are already Turing complete and implementing on-chain scripts? It seems as this is less scalable and private, not only will they turn to off chain scriptless scripts as their go to in the future, this opens up possibilities for figuratively speaking 100 times the competition for whose blockchain is the best.

But and there is a big butt, this makes it so that the only requirements for a blockchain now, is to be an efficient payment system, and to understand when obligations of a smart contract are met. And for more cheeky protocols like Mirror on Terra which allows stock market exposure with on chain pegged tokens, to support these on chain tokens, which to the best of my knowledge doesnt affect scalability that much.

This eliminates the need for a LOT of standalone blockchains with their own protocols as this opens up solutions for major smart contract interoperability possibilities. This means in my opinion that only chains that people like and have a demand for will survive, meaning that the oversaturated crypto market will finally drop some dead weight. And with bitcoin being a chain thats ready for this kind of solution, perhaps this accentuates its number 1 position in the market.

My only concern is, if a Contract is off chain, whats stopping a hacker from changing the contract?

Choose your long term bets wisely for 2022 guys, because it just might be a rough ride for most coins out there now.

TL;DR
Off chain scripts are the next solution in smart crypto, this invalidates many big chains. Careful on long term bets.

I could really use some advice on this. Ive never sold coins before since I always HODL. However, Id really like to get rid of some coins that I dont really believe in. The way I see it, my options are: 1. Sell and then buy what I want, 2. Convert the coin to the coin I want, or 3. Convert into USDC and then buy what I want with USDC. For purposes of this post, forget the tax implications. Im more curious about the fees involved in converting versus selling. Thank you in advance for your suggestions.

I know this sub loves to fud SOL, but this new one really doesn't make sense to me. Last time there was major spam from bots, the network crashed for several hours. This time, the network slowed due to the congestion, but the new features implemented kept the network up and reaching consensus the entire term. Obviously, there is still more work to be done, but it is performing better than last time, and more importantly, better than other chains.

The reason that these spams keep occurring is because the network is so cheap to use. There is no network to my knowledge that has had to deal with these conditions because every other network either hasn't had the activity or has high fees under high activity. Having a better fee system is the solution to this, but that is literally the only issue here. SOL fees are currently 1). extremely low and 2). based on the txn/block for the past several blocks, meaning that sudden spam attacks don't result in a fee increase for the initial spam, and even when they do, the fee increase is minimal. This is the real issue here, but as we can see by the fact that the network is simply congested, still doing more tps than many other chains, improvements have been made.

People talking about "centralization" for some reason sound unbelievably dumb because that is so far away from the real issue. Please dyor instead of parroting this sub's fud because literally everything they've said about SOL so far is wrong

Hello! I'm not sure if this the right place to ask. 

So I've been thinking of accepting payment in crypto currency for art commission, I have PayPal and I'm still using it, but the world is evolving and I as may get into it too as sort of an investment  and a way on insert money in the exchange (I hope I'm not too late), but I have something to ask before I make sure that I'm really up to this. I'm like a beginner in understanding wallet, I have a binance, I fairly understand how to use it now after couple of YouTube videos and the only experience I had is putting money into binance and transferring it to metamask with little amount of money as an experiment.

Question: So the question is very simple, I'm just not really understanding it even after dmor. Let's say, I want to receive $100 in BNB/btc/eth etc, how do I know that amount of BNB is equivalent to $50? I understand usdt as it is a stable coin similar to usd, but I don't understand if it's another coin. I haven't put much money to find out for myself and I don't really have friends to try it with me, so anybody wants to help if you know something about this or have experience payment in cryptocurrency? I don't understand how to make the currency similar to the price that we charge for our artwork.

Or is there a charging method more effective that converting the currency. Any suggestions is welcome \^\^

Thank you!

Hello everyone, 

I wanted to buy some decentraland for 100.

However it have 30 of fee to transfer it to my metamask wallet. 

Now I was wondering if I could let it on my binance account and let it there and it was finally a wallet and I would not spend fees. 

And if it grow I could transfer it back to fiat directly. 

Is it a good thinking ? 

Or am I missing something ? 

Thanks a lot

Ps : i need to increase my character number so i'll try to make it enough caracters. Don't mind this PS...
Binance wallet vs metamask wallet utility. 
Is it safe to store in a binance wallet. 

Decentraland cryptocurrency. 

Sorry for this but the bot don't allow me to post

Hello folks, here's some background:  
As for the title says, I'm finnaly getting my independance, moving out with my girlfriend, a dream coming true, she has a stable job and I work as a freelancer in e-commerce which is kinda unstable right now. We decided to split our costs evenly and I wanna give us the best possible as we are getting into a new life together, so, without further ado.

Heres the detailed case:   
I live in South America, BRL is my main income. I've already paid the initial rent (aprox. $415 per month). I'm now relying mostly on profting of Staking AXS tokens (23 un.) on my Binance account, which is giving \~104% APY as of today (aprox. $220 per month) but recently I found out that there's token staking like MeritCircle (MC) with 699% APY by using MetaMask on their website.   
The question is:   
As for getting/wanting the most profit from staking tokens, to make a living of it, am I on the best deal ?   
If not, how do I get the least fees from transfers if theres a better deal than I'm at right now ?   


A breakdown of my portfolio right now:  
23 AXS (on staking)  
79 MATIC (on spot, dunno what to do with it)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kinda nervous about it and would love to hear some honest takes and hoping for some good solutions, also excited to get into all of this. Really appreciate it!

&amp;#x200B;

\_PSA: I'm transfering those profits to BRL as my bank account is in it for paying bills, that's my final transaction needed\_

I got into crypto from watching skateboarding videos and clicking on a suggested content out of boredom which was a crypto meme when they were still allowed here. That was the beginning of my crypto journey. 

People continously kept telling me that I only need to invest what Im not afraid to lose because it can all go to 0. Yeah, so do the stocks. Or real estate. Look at the now unpopular Evergrande that was booming a few years ago. 
Now it got its price slashed down to a fraction of its ATH. Yet no-one tells people to only invest what you can afford to lose when discussing stocks. Or trading Turkish Lira for example which is plummeting. 
Media especially loves to point out how dangerous, risky, and could go to 0 crypto is.

Dont you think so?

This Reddit recap thing is kind of neat and of course being so far immersed into crypto the first thing I thought of when I saw it was "NFT's". I wonder if Reddit is considering or has considered when the possible tokenization of the site occurs if they will somehow incorporate this recap into it as NFT's. These cards and stats they are releasing per account could have potential value if tokenized and interest was encouraged across the site as people try to collect them and trade them. And then a secondary thing that could be done is use Moons along with fiat as a way to buy/sell/trade them to encourage more value with Moons. Thoughts on any of this?

So you, like everyone in this sub, have made millions in crypto and are ready to cash out and buy that lambo and retire, right?  Hold on, now.  Not so fast.  

The government is going to take a cut of YOUR money.  What if you don't want to give it to them, but still want to be rich?

Here's one secret they don't want you to know.  If you never sell, you never pay capital gains.  But what is the point of being rich if you can never spend it?  The answer:  to become even more rich.

The secret to retiring and buying lambos on your millions of crypto gains is that you can do so by earning passive income instead of selling your hard earned cryptos.  

Let's say your stack of ETH is now worth $2m.  You could sell that probably stretch it out to live well for the rest of your life, but you would pay at least 20% in long term capital gains taxes.  However, if you stake those earnings, you will *never* have to pay a cent of capital gains taxes on that stack of ETH.  You will continue to collect a percentage of that (somewhere between 5%-15%, depending on what the fees look like after the merge), for the rest of your life, and only have to pay taxes on the staking rewards.

This can be true of other staking cryptocurrencies, like ADA or ALGO.

By this method, you will effectively never have to pay capital gains on your current earnings, but you can still benefit from it by having it generate more money for you.

First, this is a strictly technical project so there will be many things to read !

Argennon (ARG) is a cloud based blockchain and smart contract platform which tries to solve the shortcomings of existing platforms. The Argennon blockchain uses a hybrid proof of stake (POS) consensus protocol, which is based on participation of every Argennon user.

White paper: (Chapter 1 is outdated and will be updated soon) [https://github.com/aybehrouz/argennon](https://github.com/aybehrouz/argennon) (download: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aybehrouz/AVM/main/pdf/A.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aybehrouz/AVM/main/pdf/A.pdf)) (our most important features have not been added yet, checkout our discord for more knowledge on the FAQ sections).

BEP20/ERC20 token and the governance system: [https://github.com/aybehrouz/ADAGs](https://github.com/aybehrouz/ADAGs)

The Argennon smart contract Execution Environment (AscEE): [https://github.com/aybehrouz/ascee](https://github.com/aybehrouz/ascee) The Argon programming language: [https://github.com/aybehrouz/argon](https://github.com/aybehrouz/argon)

**Website:** [https://www.argennon.com/](https://www.argennon.com/)

What do we expect: It's good to have some developers to review the project or help in testing. But the fact is, they won't be able to help doing the core development. Fully Understanding Argennon may take at least 2 months for an advanced developer.

I live a really wealthy nation. I feel so lucky, we have good healthcare, decent politics and our infrastructure is somewhat decent as well. Even working ad a teacher, I have decent sallery.

Today Norway set a record high inflation of 5.1% in 14 years. Even with my annual raise of average 2.3% it means I have less buying power and it looks to me that the gouverment isn't going to do anything about it. This might not seem a lot, but for some, this is a big deal.

A lot of other countries has it way worse and from what I can see, the support from wealthy countries to the unfortunate ones, are getting slimmer by the day.

The current inflation world wide, seems to be a bit of a *survival of the fittest* race, and it makes me wonder how is everyone else holding up?

I'm happy I invested some in crypto and I really hope this will keep me safe if the inflation goes wild. I believe we need crypto as an asset against inflation and a currency that isn't loosing value due to inflation

Which crypto do people own that really grinds your gears?

Is there one in particular where the technology really isn't that impressive, but people shill it anyways?

Are there little to no good use cases for it?

Do people only follow it because it has a cult-like following?

I just want to see people's negative opinions on various cryptos and prove why they believe that it is considered "overrated" or not as good as people may think.

Sometimes it is best to acknowledge the potential flaws in a project and see the legitimacy to people's claims as to why it may not succeed or be as good as other's may believe.

Who knows maybe someone can be saved from a project that may have some issues that they may have never known about otherwise.

With lots of recent posts asking for information on the current state of the market and the downward trends of certain coins, it has come clear that many here struggle with anxiety when it comes to the value of their coins. Checking the graphs several times a day gives a nice feeling when green is the color of the day, but when red is dominant, panic sets in and people flock to this sub to find solace and confirmation that their assets aren't doomed.

This can being a lot of stress and anxiety, so here's a mindfulness trick for you; consider the money you invested in coins to be lost forever as soon as you press the buy button. There's no more money. There's only the digital coin you purchased. And since this amount can't go up or down unless you sell or  buy more, there's no reason to stress about the fiat value of the coins.

That being said, only buy coins that are worth having. If you buy shib then you can vonsider it the same as buying a lottery ticket. You know this in advance, you have a very slim chance of striking big, but as soon as you buy the ticket the money is gone and you accept the chance that your ticket will be worthless if your numbers aren't drawn.

Let go of the value you think your fiat has. It's gone.

I wanted to start a GPU mining rig from a $800 3060ti and work itself up. But due to the Merge, I've been seeing a lot of articles that GPU mining will die without ETH and to sell their GPUs now while the prices are still up. Should I buy a 3060ti now and ignore the merge? Or should I wait until the merge is done because GPU prices are sure to drop. Then buy a GPU to start mining? Or should I just forget all about GPU mining because it's too late and it's already dead? If it's the third option, Is there anything similar to GPU mining to produce passive income?

 This sentiment here has been so volatile that a day literally feels like this

08:00 AM - Hey guys, just wanted to let everyone know that due to the US Inflation number's, we're officially in the bull market.  
09:00 AM - Oh wait, Evergrande defaulted. Crypto and Stocks are skydiving. Clearly the start of a 3 year bear market.

10:00 AM - Nevermind! It's all good now! BTC broke the \*insert random parameter which no one actually knows which here, because let's face it, no one knows sh-t about f-ck\* resistance and now it's on a clear run for 969.420k. Welcome bull market and may the alts season begin:

11:00 AM - Uh-oh. Did you hear the news? Apparently an exchange we haven't even heard before is now hacked! Bad news for crypto. Crypto winter imminent.

12:00 PM - Time to invest in crypto - by buying lunch with my CRO card. Bullish on CRO.

1:00 PM - Oh my god can China and India please not ban crypto and drop the market literally every other week? Here comes the bear market again

2:00 PM - Okay, I'll just buy the dip right? If we zoom out the charts, we're in a bull run and the market will bounce back. This is the easiest money I've ever made

3:00 PM - Why is the dip dipping more

4:00 PM - WHY IS THIS EVEN HAPPENING

5:00 PM - Yeah I was stupid enough to buy that "dip", but at least I wasn't stupid enough to predict 98k BTC in November 2021 lol

6:00 PM - Time to do my weekly research and buy some more tokens... Ofc this research won't even matter since I'll end up losing money anyways, everything has just been red all week. But at least I can pretend I know what I'm doing.

7:00 PM - Ramen's for dinners, boys! ...and the other four girls in this subreddit.

8:00 PM - I didn't even knew Evergrande could default twice in a day, but apparently so. And the charts are down AGAIN.

9:00 PM - Look, grandpa BTC did a lil pump since El Salvador bought the dip and now everyone is having a great time. I mean, there has to be a reason why the country is literally called "the saviour" and I'm pretty sure it that they are always saving our crypto. Everything is green right now and damn, I wish I had bought more this afternoon. Bull mode on

10:00 PM - I really need to go to sleep but I'll check the charts and Reddit one more time

11:00 PM - Another time

12:00 AM - And another time

so current estimates show the final bitcoin being mined in or around 2140 but even before that the the cost to mine a single bitcoin might become to high to be profitable and transaction fees are not profitable enough to cover the cost of running the network. so what would be the best solution for this?

could transaction fees be raised? and by how much?

Is there a possibility that bitcoin could be forked to allow the total amount to increase past the 21 million?

I know I probably wont be around till the year 2140 to see this, unless they invent immortality that I could buy with my crypto gains for being relatively early in this space. 

TLDR: what is the solution for bitcoin as they are all mined and can it be forked to allow bitcoin to go past the 21 million cap.

As the title says, two italians are trying to live one month and a half in El Salvador without any fiat currency, their journey started 10 days ago.

Their goal is "to visit it all, getting out of the big cities and tourist routes, meeting the people, living even in rural and non-civilized contexts, to understand how much this technology is really penetrating the territory and whether the population has really grasped its deep meaning ".   
This is something I haven't seen yet, many journalist went there to cover this topic but no one that was willing to give up on fiat and visit even the rural area.  


\[You can find their blog here\]([https://bitcoinitaliapodcast.it/missione-el-salvador](https://bitcoinitaliapodcast.it/missione-el-salvador)) both in italian and english with daily updates.  


Hope this does not break any rules, I just found about them and I thought this might be interesting for someone.

Ill give an example Im thinking about

Until an NFT can replace notarized documents (purchases for houses, vehicle, etc), could I:

* sell my vehicle
* Have all the proper documentation written up and notarized (preferably digitally, but scanned if necessary)
* Put all needed files in a zipped folder
* Mint an NFT with zipped folder
* Upon the next sell, download documents, edit, re upload to same NFT

Essentially a ledger, but a document that can be edited within the ledger.

And if so, how may I invest in the platform? Aside from Ethereum and Polygon and the other tokens.

Im curious what everyone actually feels about the possibility of another crypto winter. 
Im not the most savvy crypto guy but it seems like a crypto winter would be not very likely. In 2017 far fewer people had been involved in crypto. Now we have more people, more large companies, non crypto billionaires, multiple countries using bitcoins as legal tender. 

So it just seems like a huge doomsday crash would not last very long. If bitcoins falls to 10K its gonna be crazy how many people decide to dive in. I dont see crypto going down to sleep for years like it did in the late 20teens. 
Am I wrong? Does anyone with a bearish outlook have a different opinion on why they think it could fall.

I am starting to understand many of the risks, such as impermanent loss and such.  Im just looking for a recommended lower risk farm to engage in. I already have CRO-VVS LP to count as my high risk, but I also wanted to get something more stable/less risky. 

I know theres high risk in all of crypto/mines/farming.   But I want to find something I dont have to watch as closely and get consistent/passive returns, even if at a lower rate due to the risk being lower.  

I know the APR changes, but hell beats a savings account or some of the returns/dividends of my stock portfolio right now.   

No answers here will be considered financial advice.   Im prepared to lose what I put in, but Id prefer not to Im not a sadist.  Thanks so much!

History works in cycles. As much as we try to resist it, its been repeating since the dawn of man. 

1) Picture a pendulum that reaches its left-to-right peak every 80yrs or so. One side represents a swing towards centralization, the other representing decentralization. Within each swing comes Expansion, Boom, Recession, Depression, which then swing back going through those same waves (under either the umbrella of centralized or decentralized ideals, depending on the direction of the pendulum swing)

2) Historically, civilizations collapse after ~250yrs. Each of those collapses share commonalities: mainly, excessive dictatorship or centralization bringing on the collapse (the harder they try to squeeze us, the harder we resist and push back). 

Its no shock that we are under extreme digital centralization. Through media, the selling of our savings through inflation, the random laws currently being made for our own good (covid-related), our private property is even centralized through rent guidelines and inability to evict certain tenants. And thats just US-based. 

Now lets look at the Renaissance. The 2 largest contributors to the end of the Dark Ages were:
1) Printing Press.
2) The end of the florin currency. 

See any relationships there? the internet is synonymous with the printing press (a push towards decentralized information), and USD is synonymous with the Florin (a push towards a less centralized currency). 

To boot, we are currently within a reset range of BOTH the 80-year pendulum AND the 250year collapse. 

Food for thought.

Did the same in 2019, 2020, and 2021. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.
* **November** **Highlights:**  **ETH** and **LTC** dominate. 
* **Overall since Jan. 2018:** **ETH** solidly in the lead, followed by **BTC** and **ADA.**
* **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 533%.**

The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is**BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,**and**Stellar**.

November highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **Ethereum**and**Litecoin**are the top monthly performers, most others in the red.
* **ETH**maintains a solid overall lead,**BTC**in second place, four coins in the green since January 2018.**LTC**approaching break even point.
* 2018 Portfolio falls behind S&amp;P 500s ROI over the same time period.

## November Ranking and Dropouts

Heres a look at the movement in ranks since January 2018:

*Processing img 9gk2wita2q481...*

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:**After forty-seven months of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that[started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)have remained.**NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA**, and**Litecoin**have been replaced by**Binance Coin, Tether**,**DOT, SOL**,**Doge**, and**USDC.**

## November Winners and Losers

***November Winners*** For the second month in a row**ETH**(+8.3%) takes the victory, followed very closely by**Litecoin**, up +8%.

***November Losers*** Also for the second month in a row,**ADA**finished in last place, down -19% in November.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After forty-seven months, heres a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment.

https://preview.redd.it/ye4ge5hc2q481.jpg?width=411&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=933daede3f2b68048e252b0b22e0452cb4c11c2a

With 11,**Bitcoin**has two more monthly wins than second place**Cardano**.**NEM**has finished last place most often (12 months out of 47).

**Bitcoin**is still the only cryptocurrency that hasnt yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).

## Overall Update  ETH solidly in first place, Dash worst overall performer, and 2018 Portfolio falls from All Time High.

After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in[October](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost a bit of ground. Only 4 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green:**BTC,** **ETH,** **ADA,**and**Stellar.**

Overall, first place**ETH**(+552%) is ahead of**BTC**(+332%) and third place**ADA**(+136%).

The initial $100 invested in first place**ETH**forty-seven months ago? Its worth $654 today.

**DASH**is at the bottom, down over -82% since[January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) The initial $100 invested forty-seven months ago is worth about $17 today.

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/8mdfi8qd2q481.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a88582eeea1e1ff371b7a31f25b55a779d8ef023

The total crypto market remained nearly flat in November, falling a mere 4% from last month. Crypto as a sector is up +444% since[January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).

There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Years Day 2018, youd be doing better than the Experiments Top Ten approach (+67%), the return of the S&amp;P (+69%) over the same period of time, and each of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for**Ethereum)**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:**$114B in**[**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:**$2.65T in**[**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/)**.**

## Bitcoin dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/y7epfr0g2q481.png?width=487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2cebf616b8cb85c58cc88e82f3a3783fd6d5b73

**BitDom**declined 3% in November, ending the month at 40.7%. When looking at the entire 2018 Experiment time frame,**BTC**dominance is still near the low end. For context:

Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:[**33% in January 2018**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one).

High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:[**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018:

https://preview.redd.it/3oc09s1h2q481.jpg?width=325&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d396c962d48951de1cb6672af41217de5025877d

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost $53 in November.

If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today,**the $1000 initial investment would be worth $1,666**, up 67% from[January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).

Green is unfamiliar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and a recent development. Over the first 47 months of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only nine months of green. And all nine of the green months have come in 2021.

Heres a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment forty-seven months ago:

https://preview.redd.it/crma3l4i2q481.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46a60ec5d46e5e31aa6e5b2a90222a725930b702

The all time high for this portfolio is[October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46)(+72%). The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down[\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Remember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year. The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Alright, thats that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didnt stop the Experiment in 2018: I invested another $1000 in the***2019***,***2020,***and ***2021***Top Ten Cryptos as well. How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?  

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47): up +67% (total value $1,666)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +665% (total value $7,645)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +1016% (total value $11,160)
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +387% (total value $4,866)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, heres the bottom bottom bottom*bottom*line:

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,**the combined portfolios are worth**$25,337**($1,666 + $7,645 + $11,160 + $4,866).

**Thats up +533%**on the combined portfolios,**a second straight all time high**for the Top Ten Index Fund Experiment. Heres the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking it in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/7rszmhoj2q481.jpg?width=508&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22f1930bcc36df4f25ab5550c582c9e29ea08bf4

***Thats a +533% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four years in a row.***

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500:

Im also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.

https://preview.redd.it/6w19362m2q481.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c8654eaed799568f1809ed5bba2e2076e0c7365

The S&amp;P 500 is up +69% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on[January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)would be worth $1690 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P. Thats a bit better than the +67% return of the Top Ten Crypto Portfolio.

When I combine the four Top Ten Crypto portfolios (taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that Ive been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments) the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,690 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,800 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,400 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,200 today

Taken together, heres the bottom bottom bottom*bottom*line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P:

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,090**($1,690 + $1,800 + $1,400 + $1,200)

That is up**+52%**[since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)compared to a**+533%**gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of 481 percentage points***in favor of crypto.***

Heres a table summarizing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments.

## Conclusion:

Many thanks to the long-time Experiment followers, appreciate you taking the time to follow along over the years. For those just getting into crypto, welcome! I hope these reports can somehow give you a taste of what you may be in for as you begin your crypto adventures. Buckle up, think long term, dont invest what you cant afford to lose, and try to enjoy the ride!

Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for monthly progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects where I repeat the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of new sets of Top Ten cryptos as of[January 1st, 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34),[January 1st, 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-22), and most recently,[January 1st, 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10).

The first round of parachain auctions is winding down and the price of DOT has really suffered over the past month or so. Of course, most of the market has been down, but DOT especially got hammered. 

Unfortunately I got into Polkadot near the top and am struggling to find good reasons to believe that price action will turn around. Yesterday on InvestAnswers James said the the auctions were a miserable failure. I'm not knowledgeable enough on Polkadot to take his word for it or not.

At present, the price of DOT is about $27. I am wondering whether to:
1. start bailing on DOT gradually over a couple weeks in favor ETH/L2s
2. hang tight for actual working projects to start up at the end of December and start LP/farming
3. Drop my DOT into a second round auction project coming up
4. Put my DOT to sleep in staking for a couple years and cross fingers things turn around

I'm not trying to be bearish on DOT - on paper it's a great project and interoperability is important in my mind. But recent price action has me worried and I need to be real and start asking tough questions. TIA.

It would be totally cool if there was some kind of bot or program that had every sale and buy of a crypto asset feeding into it. This would be an interesting tool to be able to have some more knowledge on which way a candlestick has more probability of going? From a programing standpoint, it cant be that hard to just input all the exchanges buys and sells of a particular asset into an equation, then use some kind of system like you would counting cards in Black Jack. Have it go plus one or minus one in one to five minute intervals. This would really help me at my prediction betting on Pancake swap!!

Its always said that people on this sub dont know shit about fuck, and nowhere more so is that evident than by the amount of posts about market cap that make it to the front page. Every time its a variation on X coin cant reach x price because its market cap would be too high. The same arguments have been made against Doge reaching $0.01, bitcoin reaching $1,000, and more. Guess what? They were all wrong because they used flawed data incorrectly. This data was market cap.

Unfortunately, these top posts are displaying a grave misunderstanding of how market cap works and is achieved. There seems to be a myth that has perpetuated in this sub that market cap represents the amount of money invested in a coin (and hence the idea that a coin cant reach a certain amount because this would be more money than in the world economy). 

However, this is not true. Market cap simply represents the amount of coins multiplied by the last price a coin was sold for. The price moves independently of the market cap, but market cap cannot move without the price doing so.

An example to show how flawed this idea is - if I create a coin with one billion coins and sell it to myself for $1, my coin suddenly has a $1 billion market cap. Is there $1 billion dollars invested in it? No, its just $1. 

Market cap *can* be a good indicator of the size of a project, but not its future price potential. It needs to be coupled with more important data such as current supply and volume for it to have any real meaning. The sooner people learn this and start to take market cap with a pinch of salt, the better for this space and the less chance people will have of missing out on good projects. 

TLDR: this sub has a improper understanding of market cap and is using it incorrectly. Market cap does not equal amount of money in a project.

Unrealized Vs realized is just a tax  status and wordplay that fund managers like Warren Bitcoin is Rat Poison Buffet use to trick their financially illiterate investors into thinking they havent lost money. 

If you have $100 in BTC and then it falls to $50 in value, you lost $50.  It doesnt matter if you sell or not, your net worth has decreased, your access to financial resources has decreased, and your purchasing power has decreased.  Of course, this is the same for gains.

People here constantly posting you dont lose money if you dont sell dont seem to understand this.  

Dont worry about realizing gains or losses unless youre trying to claim a tax status.  Your money is already gone or made. 

This extends to the concept of Locking in profits.  No, youre not locking in profits, youre just stabilizing your net worth by diversifying into USD (or something else).

Your net worth fluctuates every second of every day in crypto.  Its ok.

If you look at crypto charts , check the 8:30 est or the time the inflation data got released 15 minutes ago.

Inflation accelerated at its fastest pace since 1982 in November, the Labor Department said Friday, putting pressure on the economic recovery and raising the stakes for the Federal Reserve.

The consumer price index, which measures the cost of a wide-ranging basket of goods, rose 0.8% for the month, good for a 6.8% pace on a year over year basis and the fastest rate since June 1982.



As mentioned, It came at 0.8% vs estimated at 0.9%, for the month and 6.8% vs estimated 6.7% year over year, not as bad as market had anticipated, and thus the correlation between the S&amp;P 500 and the rest of the markets with crypto. 

BTC is now beta 0.6 , to S&amp;P 500, meaning very close correlation. 

I heard the argument that Wall Street has begun investing in the crypto market , and thus the close correlation!

Just a heads up , have a nice day!

The major cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb has transferred close to $100 millionXRP between its own wallets in a short period of time after the coin retraced from17%growth.

The first 70 million transactions

The first large transactionappeared on the chain fourhours ago with a large exchange-related address transferring a significant number of XRP coins to another address related to the aforementioned exchange.

The recipient address that ends with "a6hpZ"currently holds 75 million XRP coins and is constantly sending and receiving large amounts of funds. The address is most likely being used by the exchange to utilize orders, make withdrawals and receive deposits.

Exchanges utilize numerous wallet addresses to make operational processes safer for their users. In case of a security breach, exchange managers would be able to properly transfer funds to safer cold wallets.

A smaller second 15 million transaction

After the 70 million cointransaction, a smaller 15 million transaction hasappeared on the chain. The second transaction was also part of the exchange's internalmovements. The transaction is also tied to the movement of the previous coins for having the same recipient address.

The sender address currently holds approximately 12 millionXRPwhile constantly sending and receiving funds on other exchange-related addresses. The "VkeWM"address is more likely to be used as the order execution hot wallet designed torapidly receiveand placefunds in the order book.

XRP's market performance

XRP has shown 15% growth in the last five days byreaching $0.93 previously. The rapid growth was justified with the former Coinbase CLO's shout-out in Congress when he asked officials tolist XRP on the official U.S. Exchange if it is being considered a security.

JAKARTA - WhatsApp has launched a cryptocurrency payment feature for a small number of users in the United States, thanks to the integration of Novi, Facebook's digital wallet which has now been renamed Meta Platform Inc. As reported by *Macrumors*, Novi's pilot program, allows users of the encrypted messaging app to send and receive money "instantly, securely, and at no cost" using the stablecoin Paxos Dollar (USPD), whose value is tied to the US dollar.
There is no limit to the number of times the Novi system can be used to send and receive money via WhatsApp. Regardless of the frequency of use, there are no fees associated with keeping a balance in a Novi account or withdrawing it to a bank account.

Also, Novi's inclusion in the chat platform has no effect on the overall encryption of private messages.
This small pilot program is available to some users in the US starting today. For more information on WhatsApp integration, see the Novi website.
This trial is one result of Meta's cryptocurrency plans, which have changed since it was officially announced in 2019. At the time, the plan was to develop a cryptocurrency called Libra that would link to Facebook's digital wallet called Calibra.

However, Libra has become Diem, and Calibra has become Novi, and instead of using Diem, Novi has adopted the stablecoin Paxos in partnership with Coinbase, which is the custody partner that holds the funds for the trial.

If we take a look at the popularity of a project like SHIB, it is currently sitting around a huge $20B market cap, which Im guessing is mostly based on the fact that it has a cute doggo logo. And thats fine, I completely understand the lure of great branding. 

Lets compare some numbers here, just for example: 

**SHIB has a total supply of 1 Quadrillion coins and a circulating supply of 549.2 Trillion coins, which means only 55% of its total supply has been mined/released so far. The more coins that enter the circulating supply, the more people have to buy SHIB to keep the price from dropping.**

**XNO has a total supply of 133.2 Million coins and a circulating supply of 133.2 Million coins - all of these coins were originally mined using CAPTCHA.** Much of XNO was actually mined by people in third world countries, not first world techies with gaming rigs (btw, this was the original ethos of Bitcoin - to bank the unbanked).

However, lets forget all of the technical fundamentals of XNO and its real world usability as a currency for a second and lets focus directly on inflation and price appreciation of these coins: Which project has the potential to make the most money in the long run? A project that has 55% of a quadrillion coins, or a project that has a deflationary, zero inflation value of 133.2M coins?

At the current market caps: 

**If you own 1,000,000 SHIB ($35) right now, and SHIB were to reach the market cap of Bitcoin, 1M SHIB would potentially be worth around $1,690 (but only if people keep buying it to sustain the price against inflation)**

**If you own 1 XNO ($4) right now, and XNO were to reach the market cap of Bitcoin, 1 XNO would potentially be worth around $6,900.**

**This means that if you had $35 worth of XNO (equal to 1M SHIB) right now, and it eventually reached the market cap of Bitcoin, it would potentially be worth $60,900 with zero chance of the inflation that SHIB has.**

It appears to me that the selling point of SHIB is *not* its inflationary or price appreciation fundamentals, which is kind of weird because I feel like most people who invest in this sort of project are purely trying to make some gains. In my opinion, the people who got into SHIB early made bank, but most people who are buying in at a $20B market cap are not going to come anywhere near those gains. 

In my opinion, this means people are purely investing in SHIB for the meme doggo aspect, which again, I get that. But look, even XNO has its own Nyan cat meme wallet where 1 XNO = 1,000,000 Nyanos (see /r/Nyano if youre interested). If you wanted to have the fun meme aspect of projects like SHIB and DOGE, but have an actual instant and fee-less to use currency, you could own 1 Million Nyanos, with zero inflation, for only $4. 

Keep in mind, this is only one example. 

**There are other projects that I could compare like LRC and MATIC for example. If you look at the total supply of LRC, it has 1.4B coins with a circulating supply of 1.2B coins (91% of the total supply) at a $3.1B market cap vs a project like MATIC which has a 6.9B circulating supply out of 10B coins (69% of the total supply) at a $15B market cap.** 

This means that LRC has a much higher market cap to grow and also has more of its total supply in circulation, so it could potentially make you much more money. This obviously disregards any project fundamentals and tech aspects of both of these impressive L2s, but something I think everyone should be considering when investing.

**If you would like to do your own research on this type of thing, I highly suggest checking out https://thecoinperspective.com/ which lets you compare market caps, coin supplies, and potential prices of projects.**

Christmas is coming up, and with Coinbase's new gift feature, I'm really thinking about giving my little brother some Etherum or Bitcoin. He is 17 and currently has no interest in crypto, but I was thinking this could be an opportunity to make him interested in investing in general, and also give him the gift that'll keep on giving in the future!

Anyone else giving their friends or family crypto for Christmas? I think I'll add in a Steam gift card or something, so he also something he can get use of immediately :)

I have a question related to countries banning crypto and I'm sorry if you guys have discussed it already. 

I know crypto is secure and anonymous, but what happens with countries where crypto are illegal? Can they track me somehow? It is secure for people continue using it? Can they invest on inteligent service to track the wallets? If you're using an app visualizator wallet, the app can give information to the goverment if they ask to, to give your ip? 

Sorry if this question is delicate or it is easy to reply, but they actually can do something? 

Can you please give me some research or work on that?

This is the last missive I received from CDC:

Thank you for the provided information. We have recently performed a review of your account and after careful consideration, we have determined that we are no longer be able to offer you our services due to a recent change in our customer acceptance criteria.
We apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause.
If you need any further assistance, I remain available.
Kind regards,
Crypto.com Team

Incidentally, I went through their T&amp;C document, and there is nothing in there regarding the use of VPNs.  I could find no information regarding why I am no longer an acceptable customer.  I have been full vetted for over 20 months, and used the account to convert some BTC to MCO, and later to CRO, which I then staked.  There were also some CRO airdrops, which Im grateful for, but nothing else.

I had a few purchases planned, and some of them I can do elsewhere, but they dont want me as a customer.

Simply put, their transparency sucks.  I believe all of my funds are safely in a non custodial DeFi wallet, but

I'm a new marketer for a Market Maker that launched their own products. We're no scam and working since 2017. The main thing that we want to promote is an opportunity to participate in pre-IPO with staking our coin on our launchpad ([https://launchpad.marketmaking.pro/](https://launchpad.marketmaking.pro/))

I'm relatively new to the crypto niche, have some solid PPC and Facebook ads knowledge, but I see that influencer marketing is a HUGE traffic source for crypto. But the amount of crypto-influencers is mind-blowing. Also, I do believe in the power of micro-communities and that it's more effective from the ROI perspetive.

I'll really appreciate if you share the links to your favorite influencers that you find trustworthy!

Not sure if this is a vent or a question.. so i'll just lay it out there.

i'm working on a DeFi project where people can crowdfund ideas / nonprofits / green initiatives with "self paying loan"  (i.e. people give you crypto, the fundee gets to take portion out, and rest is used to "re-grow" the investment back to original principal.) Since most of the "good" things in life are unfundable w/ traditional financing (thanks to sh\*tty banks), this could be a venue for "do-gooders" to raise fund and have investor get paid back - hence the term "lossless" investment.

Problem - When I shared this idea with some people (who are FAR from crypto space), the idea eludes them to the point where they think this is just pure scam. "What? free money? You're asking to go to jail" is usually the ballpark of answers I get.

Question: 

1) do you find that this is a normal response from non-crypto aware people?

2) anyone (developers, entreprneuers, etc.) who tried to do similar in the past (i.e.. share with them about the benefits of crypto and defi, not just HODL'ing)... do you find that trying to bring crypto to the masses is an uphill battle ? What are your thoughts on persisting through ? obviously its easier to sell to the people who already believe in the idea, but I wanted to get some experience from people who've done it.

Here are a few reasons why Bitcoin debit cards outweigh your traditional debit card: [What Are Bitcoin Debit Cards and Why You Should Use One](http://www.oobit.com/blog/what-are-bitcoin-debit-cards-and-why-you-should-use-one/)

* Use crypto for real world transactions  

You can use crypto to pay for groceries, transport, and everyday goods without having to worry about the premeditated work of selling and converting it.

* Spend less money on fees  

As the conversions from crypto to fiat take place on the backend, there are no hidden costs incurred for foreign exchange conversions.

* Seamlessly change between currencies  

Many Bitcoin debit cards allow users to onboard a fiat option too, allowing them to interchange between paying in various cryptocurrencies as well as fiat currencies and saving the hassle of switching between cards.

* Travel convenience  

Bitcoin debit cards can bypass conversion fees, simply offering cryptocurrency payments when youre out of your own country, or another fiat wallet internally linked that allows you to load and spend the local currency wherever you might find yourself.

When I tried to login to Gemini this morning, I was greeted with a message explaining they are experiencing some outages.

Let this be a warning to you: Move your crypto off the exchanges please! What I love about crypto is the idea of freedom. We no longer have to be restricted by custodial financial institutions regarding OUR money. 

Leaving your coins on an exchange is no different (to me) than leaving your fiat currency in a bank, and it keeps away from the freedom that crypto can provide us.

Please help me understand the following:
(All amounts are as of this writing)

ETH in my wallet:

0.00758 ETH is reported to be worth 40.61 CAD.
40.61/0.00758= 5357CAD/ETH

ETH in crypto earn:

0.15 ETF is reported to be worth 782.11 CAD.
782.11/0.15= 5214CAD/ETH


Aaaaand the list goes on:

DOT in earn = 34.94CAD/DOT

DOT in app = 35.9CAD/DOT

LINK in earn = 25.45CAD/LINK

LINK in app = 26.15CAD/LINK

AVAX in earn = 111.28CAD/AVAX

AVAX in app = 114.39CAD/AVAX

The lis goes on and on, you get the idea

I reached out to crypto.com support and was explained that spreads were shown on the crypto earn values and that they were all 100% real time.

So what am I missing?

Thank you!.

You can accuse me of wishful thinking but I really dont think that the infamous crypto Youtubers that this sub hates so much will have the same kind of presence they once did. Yeah theyll still be around but I doubt it will be the same kind of intensity it once was. If internet culture has taught me anything, its that influencer communities that appeal to ignorant young men typically have a short lifespan due to the influencer peaking and the audience moving on. Anyone remember the YouTube fitness community that took the internet by storm 5-10 years ago and promised that their magic supplement would make you gain 50 lbs of muscle in a month? Theyre well past their prime now even though the fitness industry is still evolving and growing. Im optimistic the same thing will happen with Crypto

In a market where there is no liquidity there is a cost, and in markets with liquidity there is a different cost.

Problems in illiquid markets:
hard to buy and sell at any price (opportunity costs)
Hard to know the price
Larger bid ask spread
More volatility (greater risk)

 A lot of these will cost you money. If you are interested in a world where you can exchange an arbitrary number of assets for other assets you understand why there have been historic liquidity crises that large entities like banks, hedge funds, and wealthy individuals have stepped in to "solve".

I bring it up because I think we have become so blinded by blanked statements like "we need liquidity in the markets" and also become very averse to dealing with illiquid markets that we have begun to take for granted that it's worth allowing anyone who can provide liquidity please do it. Banks and oligarchs have been extracting the spread from our markets for like a thousand years or more, they have been convincing us that we need liquidity so that they can justify all the crime the do to make it happen. I think we have an unreasonable expectation for what a liquid market feels like fueled by margin and other instruments that do not benefit the average person. I definitely think people should be free to do whatever they want in the markets (especially in crypto) but I think we should take an honest look and at least recommend against certain practices.

Decentralized liquidity pools are a good start towards a solution. Currently I'm sure most of the liquidity on centralized exchanges is provided by the exchange themselves or their rich friends and I bet they are doing the same exploitive stuff that happens with market makers in the stock market dark pools. Dexs are interesting to me because basically anyone can get a big enough bag to provide liquidity for a token pair and everyone can see what everyone is getting as far as rewards so a dex can't really exploit it's regular users to benefit the market makers, you would just use a different dex. I would like to see even more innovations that start to make it harder and harder for actors to extract value from the system in this way, I'm especially excited to see of we can manage to have an acceptable amount of liquidity that adds to the system rather than takes from it.
For example a smart contract protocol that is an autonomous market maker, inaccessible by anyone, that provides liquidity and grows it's funds perhaps at first through donations but then performs automatic philanthropy or random rewards to all users out of its excess. This would justify the initial donation used to fund the liquidity providing contract. Just spitballs now.

&gt;I have abandoned Ethereum despite supporting it in the past.

&gt;"Ethereum culture suffers massively from the Founders Dilemma

&gt;Everyone is already far too rich to remember what they originally set out to do.
-CEO of Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) on Twitter

In less than three weeks following his statements, his company purchased 156,400 Ethereum, worth over half a billion U.S. Dollar

When asked about this, he answered:

&gt;bought this ETH from whoever was financially illiterate enough to sell this weekend

Remember: Someone spreading unreasonable FUD about a given Crypto, might actually only be interested to buy it cheaper, this is the best example

I saw Simply ($SIMPLY) on CoinMarketCap trending the other day and started looking in to it.

Simply claims they will analyze new, pre-sales crypto projects and rate their viability. Their platform will be launching in the next few weeks. They are part of a larger organization called Urgaming so it seems like they have some support. They've done a security audit and their Telegram is fairly active. It seems like a good idea to attract new crypto investors who are not familiar with technical analysis or just don't know where to start when finding new projects.

Do you think they have potential?

Hi all,
Many think that crypto will be the future of payments. Actually its already a reality as some companies started accepting bitcoin as form of payment.
My only doubt is about the price stability of cryptocurrencies. How can you plan your business on a currency that can heavily fluctuate on daily basis? If I need to sell 100 books to hit my monthly target assuming an average selling price of $10, how can I risk my success if that $10 can easily become $8 or $6?
Do you have any idea on how we will overcome this challenge? Some ideas (tell me if Im totally off here)

- products price will simply stay in $ and consumers will just pay the equivalent in crypto. Once the transfer is executed, the seller will just automatically convert crypto in $ (conversion fees might be on consumers). This approach should work for sellers but its a bit tricky for the customers as their buying power will swing a lot
- products price will be in crypto and sellers will freeze it for a fixed time (e.g 1 day/1 hour/ etc). After that, crypto prize will be updated based on latest exchange $/crypto
- Bank of America will create an official crypto version of the American dollar that will have the same value of the $ plus the benefits of a cryptocurrency (like USDT but official)

Thoughts?

#Loopring starts with Ethereums massive size (and flaws)

We first need to understand that ethereum is the most used blockchain today by far. It boasts the most developers, most decentralised apps and most exchanges by far. 

Eths smart contracts enable the existence of DEXs (decentralised exchanges) which fill the role of banks so you and I can buy crypto using other crypto.

SushiSwap and Uniswap (DEXs built on ethereum) alone have a 24-hour trading volume of $3.5 billion. Thats a lot of activity!

Apps and DEXs on ethereum have basically recreated the traditional financial system we have now.

#But like a highway in constant rush hour, ethereum isnt made to handle transactions by millions of people around the world simultaneously.  

Ethereum has a low TPS (transactions per second) of around 15 which makes it easy to get congested and traffic to build up.

Eventually each transaction will go through, but there are downsides.

And these are transaction fees, or gas.

Transactions need  A LOT of gas on ethereum, whether youre doing something small like transferring from Wallet A to Wallet B, or something big like exchanging your familys savings for tokens in Uniswap. 

Look how huge ethereums fees are right now compared to other blockchains (smaller is better):

* Eth: $4 (on the low side)
* Cardano: $0.27 (93% cheaper)
* Tezos: $0.10 (97.5% cheaper)
* Algorand: $0.002 (99.99% cheaper)

And here's the speed difference in transactions per second (higher is better):

* Eth - 15 TPS
* Tezos - 40 TPS (166% faster)
* Cardano - 250 TPS (1,567% faster)
* Algorand - 1,100 TPS (7,233% faster)

#Loopring builds a highspeed skyway above ethereums congested highways

And the name of this skyway is zkRollup.

One of the things zkRollups do is group hundreds of transactions and process them together instead of individually - and on a separate layer of the blockchain called Layer 2. 

This new layer is capable of handling up to 2,000 transactions per second. 

This means gas fees are slashed because:

* Carpools (transaction bundles) are now available so there are less cars (transactions) causing traffic on the main highway (the Ethereum blockchain) 
* Theres also a carpool lane open for further decongestion (Layer 2)
* Transaction speed on both layers is increased

Less gas fees means developers can experiment and build apps and users can exchange tokens without spending a ton to further grow adoption. 

#TLDR:

Would you rather take the express skyway or commute through traffic congested highway every single day?

Ten Thousand Suns is a collection of 9,096 (including Sol) NFTs which correspond to all stars of stellar magnitude 6.5 or brighter. Every star visible to the naked eye from Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

We have obtained data from the Yale Bright Star Catalog which lists the properties of every star visible to the naked eye. The catalog was last published in 1991 and is open-source and available across the internet. We have processed and enriched this data set to make it accessible and interpretable to modern data professionals. This includes parsing certain fields into more human-readable formats, adding missing fields such as stellar radius (by consulting research and replicating those equations for ourselves), and merging in auxiliary data sources such as constellation names and Bayer-Flamsteed metadata. Our source data will be available for download in .csv format. Please feel free to download it, and use it for any purpose which advances our understanding of the cosmos.

&amp;#x200B;

We have also generatively rendered using WebGL each star within this catalog. The stars are accessible as an interactive experience in web browsers, as well as in augmented reality and virtual reality.

Hello. Since I found out the European and French central banks prefer Tezos over Ethereum as they test CBDC and digital Euro, I feel XTZ is a sleeping giant. Moreover Socit gnrale , france's 3rd largest bank also chose XTZ , they want to manage crypto assets for professionals in 2022. I am fairly certain a lot is happening behind the scene between Tezos and state institutions. Which is great news for all crypto.

 The benefits I see in XTZ is efficiency , lower costs and much more environment friendly, which is a sensitive issue with the public and politicians.
Australia and Indonesia central banks want their own crypto currency.
Ubisoft, a French company also recently picked XTZ for t NFT in its games.
. 
Do you guys think XTZ could become mainstream institutionally? Replacing ETH as the leader? Am I right to be bullish now?  Why isn't it faring much better considering its prospects?

In this decentralized world, we always see how freedom leads to centralization, be it Binance, Bitcoin or Ethereum, but now even [CoinMarketCap.com](https://CoinMarketCap.com) doesn't support innovation anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a new idea, implementation and many possibilities for this token, thanks to our professional circle of capable artists, but all this does not matter because we want to use an advanced network.

&amp;#x200B;

HPB offers 2 functional block explorers and my token is listed on well-known small centralized exchanges like [Bibox.com](https://Bibox.com) or DEXs.

I have a friend who is completely blind, but has tremendous aptitude for understanding and comprehension. This friend listens to a lot of podcasts and YouTube via their PC by using on screen speech apps and the like.. Recently I was speaking with them and they wanted me to help them get into investing, specifically with cryptocurrency.. Now this is where I realized how exclusionary KYC truly is.. My advice to this friend was to give them the safest bets possible, especially considering their fixed income and my actual desire to help them get ahead financially. It isn't easy being blind. The world is very critical of being able to see.

So traditionally they would use a text to speech app to fill out URL boxes or search certain things but that app does not work with some secured apps, like ones linked to financial institutions. 

This is where a helper like me comes in, doing what I can for them regarding things of this nature.

Well being as this person has no drivers license nor visa (passport) it comes down to a state issued ID.. which after a few days of *frustrating* talks with the couple of exchanges we can use here, they are saying they can't verify their identity. 

Not only can they not verify identity, but I realized very quickly that if it even came down to sending or receiving cryptocurrency, they would be out of luck as well. 

They can't confirm if an address is correct via the first few/last few digits, like most of us do. They can't easily pull up a QR code to allow transfer into a wallet.
The only thing they can do is hope someone like me is around to help them should they need it.

This doesn't scream "financial freedom" or "financial inclusion" to me.

This thought snowballed quickly, and I am now reaching out to this community for any advice or maybe spark innovation to address this..

Thanks.

If there was anything we could learn this year then it is that there is not a single person on this world who can predict this market.

Just listen to yourself, and even if you make a mistake you will learn from it, so you will do better next time. 

All of them experts can only guess and hope that they are correct. "Experts".

I hold VeChainand before May this year I could read almost everywhere how VET will reach a minimum of $0.50, and $1 is expected by the end of the year. 

Because of that news, I didnt sell VET when it was on ATH when I had a chance to take descent profits.  The same goes for other cryptocurrencies. 

*- BTC $100k to the EOY, ETH to $10k EOY and blablabla.*

*- The dip is finished, hitting new moon by the EOY* 

All wrong.

In an age in which it is hard to be anonymous, the identity of the cryptocurrencys inventor remains a mystery

Thirteen years ago a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto released a paper describing a new software system called bitcoin. Today bitcoin is worth more than $1 trillion and has sparked a phenomenon that, its proponents believe, might rewire the entire global financial network.

There is a mystery at the heart of bitcoin, however. Who actually is Satoshi Nakamoto?

Nakamotos identity has since been shrouded in secrecy, nobody knows who the founder of the coin is.

The Short Public Life of Satoshi Nakamoto
On Oct. 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto sent a nine-page paper to a group of cryptographers outlining a new form of electronic cash called bitcoin.

At the time nobody cared about Nakamotos identity. Most of the people in that group were skeptical of the bitcoin idea itself.

Cryptographers and developers such as Hal Finney, Nick Szabo, David Chaum and Wei Dai had been trying for more than a decade to develop an electronic version of cash. All of them had failed, for a variety of reasons.

On Jan. 9, 2009, Nakamoto launched the bitcoin network. Mr. Finney was one of the few who was intrigued by it, and in the early weeks the two worked remotely to get the network running. The first bitcoin transaction went from Nakamoto to Mr. Finney.

I am not here ranting, i'm in peace, genuinely trying to understand something i've been wondering (and i am sure many have as well). 

After many readings on the internet, watching youtube videos and read actual books, I am not clear on something that seems to me an elephant in the room: 

* Besides transferring money to a third party with low (or no) comissions or making profits on trading currencies or holding them as long term financial investment, what is an actual real life example of crypto currencies, blockchain networks, apps, etc?

I see a lot of discussion on the future of internet, apps built on blockchain and so on, decentralizing, but i can't any real life examples. 

Can you folks point me a few examples or are we in a point where there's only ideas for future frameworks and nothing is tangible as of yet? I'm serious and asking to learn from people in the field.

The state of this sub sure has changed since 2018 and while that isn't necessarily bad I see new people struggling with the same stuff over and over again.

 I'll just quote a few posts from the front page to try and get my point across.

&gt;Just because a coin's value is $0.00001 doesn't mean it has room to reach $1

**Isn't this self-evident?** How much time do you have to spend researching crypto before you realize that every token has a defined supply that plays a key role in determining the token price? Why are we still learning the basics here?

&gt;Saying "we are still early" is setting yourself up for wildly unrealistic expectations

You are still early. There is no doubt about it. For perspective, only [3 million ETH wallets](https://nairametrics.com/2020/06/18/ethereum-wallets-holding-at-least-0-1-eth-just-crossed-the-3-million-mark-for-the-first-time/) have more than 0.1 ETH in them. There are 8 BILLION people on this planet and they all need financial services. You are as early as you can be. Even Bitcoin active wallets only crossed 65 million active users recently. Do the math. It's that simple.


&gt;TA YouTubers are full of sh*t

YouTubers are here to make money for themselves, not for you. If you want them to paint a bullish scenario just because you want your bags to go up they will. Their content is determined by metrics and your Google searches. If you want to feel bullish they will make you feel bullish because that brings in more revenue.

This doesn't mean that you can't find reasonable people out there. Some that I follow are expecting BTC to go down to 30K before we can make a significant rebound. Are they also full of shit?


&gt;Whitepaper's today is nothing more than a long list of promises like that of a politician's manifesto before election! 

Did you not find it suspicious that people asking for money up front can't even bother to give you a working product to try first? Whitepapers are there for show and none of them should be taken seriously. This is something we all learned during the ICO era, why do we have to reevaluate the same shit over and over again?  They all smell like manure so treat them accordingly.


**Perspective is everything in crypto**


The problem may lie in the unrealistic expectations new people are fed with as soon as they step into the crypto industry. Before you can talk reason into them they will find Bitboy crypto and he will tell them that Ripple is going to $250 in 2022 while also lying that he is an expert on the subject.


The hard truth is that no one knows what they are actually doing. We can't know if Ethereum will be here in 10 years even though it may seem obvious today. What if they don't fix the issue with fees and people just find something different but equally useful?


**You are running a marathon** and anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar. If you want to "make it" in crypto you need to commit to something. Find a project that resonates with your personal beliefs and moral values, get involved, stack the token over time and reap the rewards once people recognize the value you saw years ago.


It is really not that hard if you stop listening to idiots. NO ONE KNOWS what they are talking about when it comes to long-term investments. Just find something that makes sense to you and mute the noise. It won't get you anywhere. 

If all those influencers actually made generational wealth with crypto they would have no time to record videos, make stupid faces in the thumbnail and lie all day for a living.

Okay so with all the hype around the [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) marketing i have been asking myself how effective this really is. I see countless events coming up in the [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) arena, that A LOT of non crypto enthusiasts will see without a doubt.

But does it really stand up to the hype? Will this lead to significant crypto adoption?

I personally am pretty young still, and while i have heard about crypto online for years, i never really started investing until i decided to sit down and figure out my general finances. All of that started with stocks, just some global ETF's the normal rational approach i guess? Well i got curious about some more lucrative options that i could expose a small percentage of my portfolio too.

What i am trying to say is, i knew about Coinbase and Binance and all those options through online marketing, however i never felt impacted by it until i personally decided to go down the rabbit hole out of my own curiosity.

Obviously where the marketing worked is getting me to Coinbase as my first exchange because that's what you heard everywhere, i since moved on but yea i guess you can be bullish on [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) , i just don't know what it means for the entire crypto space?

I've been using DAI as my stable coin for ages now and always considered them a solid trustworthy project.

Just wondered if there was any reasons to switch to the newer stable coins. Lower fees? More pairs on more exchanges? Better auditing?

This post with an obligatory 'Fuck Tether', as we all know sooner or later its going to impale us all from behind without lube, leaving us all trying to buy the mega-dip, but probably failing as most exchanges are down. I would hope Uniswap is still up, although increased traffic is probably going to cause them issues too.
-------------------------------
16391381582021-12-10
Ive been looking into Tezos during the dip but from my understanding, staking brings in around 5-6% annually, which is fine.

But when I look at the fee its 5%.

So is it actually worth it, are those two 5% referring to a different principle amounts?

I could just be bad at math but if anyone can clarify this for me it would be a big help.

Or if there are staking pools that offer bigger dividends that would be great too, although I expect  that 5% is around the average. 

Thanks for your help

So, the other day, I wrote a post asking people to nominate which coin they thought would challenge BTC/ETH in the neat future and become the third important coin in town...


It triggered some interesting discussions and quite a bit of shilling (which I certainly didn't mind!), and it certainly gave me a couple of coins to think about that perhaps I hadn't spent too much time looking into up until now.


But it also made me think about the opposite situation.


There are some who believe that we might be heading into a crypto winter - that there is the potential for a perfect storm of conditions in the upcoming months that could see crypto tumble. Evergrande is defaulting on its debts and there are some that think this might be the first domino to fall in a global financial crisis that will result in chaos not seen since 2008. There is political instability, with the potential for conflict, in a number of places in the world. And there is continuing talk of legislation so that governments can attempt to wrest greater control of crypto. Throw in the potential for more covid varients popping up in 2022 and there's all the ingredients needed for some serious problems. And, if all of that hits together, then the values of crypto could tumble for some time.


So if we do see a shake-up in the world of crypto in 2022, who is going to fall by the wayside? Not talking about the assortment of shitcoins, but which genuine players are no longer going to be with us when the dust settles?


I'm going Devil's Advocate here and saying CRO (even though I have some in my portfolio). Why?


Well, Crypto.com is the public face of crypto to millions of people who'd never heard of it (or only vaguely heard of it) until this year. Their adverts and sponsorship have pulled people in that previously would have steered clear of crypto as something too risky. But those same people also have unrealistic expectations of continued exponential growth. And, being new to the market and buying in (in many cases) at an ATH then - if crypto winter arrives - they are all going to lose an awful lot of money. And they won't be happy. I see class action lawsuits ahead in such circumstances. Crypto.com could go from poster child to scapegoat pretty fast. And CRO is tied to it and goes down with that same ship.


Ok, maybe not entirely realistic. I'm sure you can do better. But I figured I'd call this the anti-shill because I want to understand what you see is destined to fail - maybe even without a crypto cataclysm!

I have been using Coinbase/Pro for a month, this week I sent a large bank transfer, to the same address as before, that never showed up. Ill bite my tongue on this ongoing issue, as the point of this post is not to vent.

Consequently Im at a loss as to how/where I can safely invest in crypto.

It seems everywhere you look, every platform has terrible reviews, fake reviews both positive and negative. It seems being a well known brand, having an IPO etc doesnt make you exempt from communities all trying to take legal action.


This was my first crypto issue and its a big one. I also use ledger and dont leave funds/coins on coinbase. I initially used eToro but they have a 60 day period before being able to withdraw funds to their wallet (which only accepts a handful of different coins). As Im still in that 60day area, I dont want to risk putting more into them until I can see how the withdrawal process goes. Im aware you cant sell from your wallet into their platform.

Im based in the UK. Ive looked into Binance, crypto.com, and with ledger: coinify, moonpay. But they all have serious concerns. There are many other exchanges, but not all allow you to withdraw to your own wallets.

Even if I turn my back on crypto, I still need to be able to sell my existing coins somewhere secure and reliable.

Im really upset that coinbase has shattered my trust in crypto exchanges just as I was getting started, through no error at my end (as far as I can tell, and double checked) I already was very careful, I just didnt expect exchanges themselves to be a bigger issue than hacking.

I dont mind paying a higher fee for top security and good customer service. Any suggestions greatly appreciated

The live Ethereum Name Service price today is $45.66 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $97,632,824 USD. We update our ENS to USD price in real-time. Ethereum Name Service is down 5.64% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #219, with a live market cap of $924,440,354 USD. It has a circulating supply of 20,244,862 ENS coins and a max. supply of 100,000,000 ENS coins.

If you would like to know where to buy Ethereum Name Service, the top cryptocurrency exchanges for trading in Ethereum Name Service stock are currently Binance, OKEx, Mandala Exchange, Bybit, and ZBG. You can find others listed on our crypto exchanges page.

ENS is an open, public, decentralized identity protocol that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can register .ETH names native to ENS or import in DNS domain names they already own, which they can use as their cross-platform web3 username and profile, one name for all of their crypto addresses, and as a decentralized website.

$ENS is the governance token of the ENS DAO, which manages the treasury and key parameters of the ENS protocol.

As the cryptocurrency space is highly technical, it can be overwhelming for first-time users and non-tech-savvy individuals to onboard. 

Take crypto transactions, for example. To send a crypto payment, you need a long public wallet address composed of a string of digits and letters of the alphabet that looks like gibberish. Moreover, users have a different public address for every cryptocurrency, making it difficult to manage and confusing for crypto beginners.

ENS, short for Ethereum Name Service, aims to make the crypto and decentralized finance space a bit simpler by allowing a user to create a universal nickname for all your public addresses and decentralized websites. Instead of having an unreadable string of keys for each crypto address, youll have a single ENS domain, like Rick.eth, where you can receive any kind of crypto and NFTs.

ENS aims to become the naming protocol of the decentralized internet by creating portable Web 3.0 usernames that are interoperable across all blockchains and decentralized apps (dApps). To understand its impact, lets take a look at how ENS works.

So [this](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/cryptocurrency-world-map/) map has been shared on here before, but I decided to make my own thread about it because it has so many problems. It really seems like that dude has never worked with Google Trends before and didn't think a lot about his map. Firstly, it is not very transparent - did he search only for the names or also for the abbreviations? I think for some coins the abbreviation is used more regularly, for some the full name, so this probably leads to some distortion. 

The bigger problem though: he writes "Search interest for Terra, Shiba Inu or Polygon is ambiguous because people also search for those terms in different contexts". However, he seemingly did not think all that long about this. Some examples:

* Italy seems to be full of Cardano fans! I'm sure it has nothing to do with the town called Cardano in Northern Italy
* same with Solana and "La Solana" in Spain
* You will notice "Avalanche" is included, do you know in which countries it's searched a lot? Japan, Canada, United States. So all countries with mountains, where you might want to inform yourselves about avalanches. The most common related search? ["Avalanche Colorado"](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2021-01-01%202021-12-10&amp;q=avalanche). Huh
* TRON is the 5th most searched crypto - not bad!! I'm sure it has nothing to do with the movie or the Audi E-Tron, the [top related searches](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2021-01-01%202021-12-10&amp;q=tron) are "audi", "e tron audi", "e tron gt", "e tron gt audi" and "audi gt"

and others that I've missed. It is a fun little gimmick, but don't take it too seriously

First off I understand there are dozens methods hackers steal millions in crypto and the technical aspect of it gets extremely complicated. Also I'm glad they had no hiccups in announcing they would compensate all individuals who had their assets stolen, this helps dispell distrust in the industry as a whole.   But nearly $200 million in crypto just stolen from a massive exchange with most likely inconclusive infestation? This just seems way too fishy to not be asking questions.

Now maybe most of the executives at bitmart didnt coordinate anything. However the incentive this massive exchange or the executives/ shareholders could have to just make $200 million dissappear and impossible to track can not be denied. 

Do you think this was just a legitimate hack that no one saw coming? If not, what are your theories as to what could have possibly happened in this case or similar cases that have happened?

Hello, fellow kids!

I was recently thinking of my asset allocation and was wondering what yours is and why? Currently mine looks like this:

6% crypto (BTC)
0% altcoins/memecoins/shitcoins

74% all world total market index fund
0% stocks

20% cash

My allocation looks like this, because I've been slowly DCA-ing into crypto for the last couple of months. Before that, I was just invested into an all world total market index. I decided to diversify with some crypto, as to not keep all of my eggs in a single basket. Started reading a bit and slowly DCA-ing into BTC. I'm thinking of a target allocation of 10-15% crypto, but haven't decided how I would rebalance if there is a huge price increase or decrease somewhere in the future.

What does your portfolio look like? A 100% in crypto? 0%, just looking from the sidelines?

I've been hearing about USDC defi yields for a while, and I'm considering putting some money in for a good reliable APR. But I'm still having trouble understanding it. How exactly does it work? How safe/ reliable is it? Where should the coins be staked? What should I take into consideration when choosing a platform? 

Does someone have some good sources of information on this? Books, channels, articles, anything.  I'd like to know more, but I'm having trouble finding concrete info myself. 

Thank you in advance!

Hey people, I need help or advice what to do.

So the issue is, I have some amount of DAI on my Metamask. I wanted to bridge it to XDAI and me as a noob, totally forgot I need to pay ETH gas fees. So, is there any solution available to bypass that? Or to pay fees directly in DAI?

If there is any other way, I would like to know that. I really want to try to skip buying ETH for that fees if that is possible, or send it from other places.

I need to fill out 500 characters to post this.

Anyway, I wanted to switch to XDAI to stake DONUTS on Honeyswap. They have nice APY, so if you have Donuts from r/ethtrader , you can make some money by staking too.

----------------

Many moons ago, [safemooners got themselves in a tizzy about a cryptic date](https://twitter.com/mrssafemoon/status/1406343105792651268?s=21) left intentionally on some marketing material distributed by official Safemoon communication. There was a hell of a lot of speculation on what this meant, as well as confusion on the dates. In American, it reads the 12th of September 2021. Sure enough, that date came and went without any ceremony so of course the narrative shifted effortlessly to Ah, CEO John Karony is using English date format, as COO Jack Haines is English. Makes sense   

That would make the date the 9th of December. Which was yesterday.  

As expected, absolutely nothing happened and CEO John ~~Baloney~~ Karony needed a quick and easy excuse to A) fulfil the cryptic promise from June and B) get the screaming investors off his back.  

What would you do in such a situation? Probably admit what you had planned, explain why its not materialised and then either give a new approximate date or scrap it with an apology.  

What does John Karony, Safemoon CEO wnderkind do?  

[hush, Halo time](https://i.redd.it/bwfzctbyek481.jpg)  

Not once.  

[Twice.](https://i.redd.it/3v4pwgymsk481.jpg)  


These are people asking the CEO on the public discord what is happening with promised roadmap features, and his response is to hand wave them away and say Im playing Halo today 

This, in the context of Bitmart exchange being hacked and some 27 Trillion safemoon tokens being dumped on the market, against the backdrop of Safemoon CBO leaving and then a 20T wallet mysteriously and conveniently awakening and dumping its entire contents on the market, in the context of several missed deadline, incomplete product launches, mass departure of core members.  

And the CEOs best response is to say Shut the fuck up and let me play Halo in peace   

Truly we are living in an idiocracy.

I'd like your opinion about BTC whales and by whales i mean really huge whales.
I read the recent interview of the Saylor, CEO of Microstrategy who now own 112400 BTC.

Here is my thought...
If one person/company own 112400 BTC, it's easy to think that 8 or 9 others possess/could own the same amount to reach in total 1 million BTC.

Now if we multiply that by 22 (there is only 22 billilons BTC), i think it would be easy for 200 or 300 huge companies/rich men to posses all the BTC market leaving us peanuts satoshis
After all BTC is "just" 1000 billions when the whole economy FIAT reprensent 500 000 bilions.

So isn"t it possible that with actual prices or dips 90% or BTC end up in a few hands ?

If you've been around for long enough in this sub, you have probably seen tons of people saying they don't have more fiat to buy the dip.

I just wanted to share a little strategy to make this work better for the ones looking for a solution.

Well, first and foremost, I wanted to share that this complements the strategy I have for every "DCA" (it's not really DCA but let's call it that) period.

In this strategy, we invest a percentage of the money at price the coins are now, a percentage in orders at the price the coin could reach if it dips and a small percentage for the "dip bank", a sum of money in case the market goes to shit. 

For example, if a coin is at a ATH price, I'll invest less at the price it is now, maybe 10%. I'll add 70% in the case the price drops, which is very probable knowing it is at a new ATH (it could be divided into different price points below). 

Finally, I'll add 20% to the dip bank.

With this strategy, I'm already looking forward for dips as they will secure the 70% allocated. However, if the market goes beyond my predicted dip, I'll have 20% to invest.

BUT, instead of investing those 20%, if the market keeps dipping, I invest a percentage of those. And keep working with Percentages (lower than 100% of course). 

That's how you'll always have money to invest.

TL;DR: Allocate money for a dip bank. And if we always invest in percentages lower than 100% of total fiat available, we will always have more money to invest

Be very careful with Game of Laughs tokens as there appear to be two; the one listed on Coinmarketcap had the contract address **0x535440b93dd3e99f57a3d7f5a8e65aa68c630c3a ($ GOL)** while the one on their website, [gameoflaughs.com](https://gameoflaughs.com), has this **0x535440b93dd3e99f57a3d7f5a8e65aa68c630 (GOL)**. As soon as I commented below the posts on Twitter they changed the one on CMC to the same one on the website.

Furthermore, the Instagram page has more than 175 thousand followers but the comments under the token posts are almost always 0; the same on Facebook. There are only 3,300 followers on Twitter and the comments are always few. I only think of two scenarios: either their pages have a huge number of fake followers or they are deleting the comments of those who report the issues.

Among other things, the token ($ GOL) is reported on BSCheck as a possible honeypot. At this point I don't know who created it but the fact remains that in twitter posts they always use the $ GOL symbol instead of GOL.

Please let me know if I missed something and if you have had any direct experience with this token, I might as well be wrong. I hope I explained myself.

Disclaimer: I am not sure if it is a scam or if it is just something handled in a questionable way; when in doubt DYOR

**How to choose a project for investment?**

Since 2015 I am interested in cryptocurrency, developing blockchain project and investing in projects. During 6 years I saw a lot of scam in which people invested hundreds of millions of dollars. Now investors are more literate and trying to analyze the project.

**What is your algorithm for analyzing a blockchain project?**

My algorithm is:

**1) Ideas**

Assess the relevance of the idea, the likelihood that it solves a real problem. It is important that you share the views and ideas of the project

**2) Team**

Developer licenses, how many years on the market, media history (scandals), who is the CEO of the company, employees are not interesting, they come and go...

**3) Ways to achieve the plans**

**The most important point!** The creators of the project can tell a lot of interesting things in the waittaper, but if they do not know how to implement said, then most likely the project skam (or too innovative idea that needs time).

**4) Timeline**

Any project plans a timeline for each item in its plan. It all depends on the innovativeness of ideas, trivial projects deadlines should be respected in time or with a margin of error to a maximum of six months. Don't forget that the industry is just budding and not meeting deadlines is normal practice, I as a developer understand this very well. If the project makes innovative solutions, it is acceptable to postpone updates for 3-12 months. If more than 1 year, there is distrust.

**5) Technology**

List of technologies used. Very cool when a project has its own technological developments (e.g. its own blockchain) or improvements of popular solutions (e.g. its own consensus algorithm for Ethereum blockchain).

**6) Listing**

Listing can be done on rating sites (coinmarketcap, etc) and exchanges (binance, etc). For me, the listing is not the most key factor, I think many know the projects that were loudly released on exchanges, but the teams were weak for implementation of their plans, or even worse were scam and exchanges had to delist.

**7) Scientific Approach**

I have great respect for projects that write their documentation in professional scientific language. This is very rare, as most often the documentation is written by "marketers" (to sell the idea to more people) who are far from the scientific subtleties that lie in the whole essence of the project. By scientific approach I mean the argumentation of written according to the accepted norms in the economic, legal, technological, statistical, historical aspects. Let it be difficult to read, but as close as possible to the reality of the project development.

**8) Analyst comments**

Relative point, it all depends on who the analyst. Opinions of the people on the forums are the most useless information, because most of them have either bought the coin or lost money in it, that is, these opinions are biased. If the analyst is a well-known personality in the financial industry, you can listen to him, but he may also be interested in PR for the asset. More than once the representatives of the major banks and the government said that Bitcoin will die, expected a fall in the rate and bought it themselves. Therefore, any opinion should be regarded as nothing more than an opinion.

**On December 9th, Phunware, an enterprise cloud office software company, announced that it had purchased another 100 bitcoins for approximately US$4.975 million in cash, at an average price of approximately US$49,750 per bitcoin. As of December 9, 2021, Phunware holds a total of approximately 630 bitcoins. The total purchase price of these bitcoins is approximately US$36.8 million, and the average purchase price is approximately US$58,513 per right bitcoin.**

***In the same breath, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor tweeted that he bought 1,434 bitcoins for about $82.4 million in cash. As of Dec. 9, the company held about 122,478 bitcoins with a total purchase price of $3.66 billion, or an average price of about $29,861 per bitcoin.***

According to documents submitted by MicroStrategy to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last Monday, the company purchased 7,002 bitcoins in October and November at a cost of US$414 million, with an average price of US$59,187 per bitcoin. After completing this "purchase", the total number of bitcoins held by MicroStrategy has exceeded 120,000

Although most investors in the crypto market have only one or two years of understanding of MicroStrategy, the development process of MicroStrategy has exceeded 30 years. In November 1989, MicroStrategy was established in Tysons Corner, Virginia, USA. It is an enterprise that provides business intelligence, data analysis, mobile software development, and cloudcomputing. For 30 years after its establishment, MicroStrategy has always adhered to its leadership. In terms of business, it has not been reported that it has any intersection with encrypted assets. Even the company's CEO Michael Saylor (Michael Saylor) criticized Bitcoin on social platforms in 2013.

*However, with the arrival of the bull market in the crypto market in 2020 and the increasing risk of uncertainty in the global economic environment, Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy under his leadership did not escape the "law of true fragrance" in the end. On August 11, 2020, MicroStrategy suddenly announced that it had bought $250 million worth of Bitcoin, and thus became the world's first public company to publicly allocate Bitcoin as an asset. In this regard, MicroStrategy gave the following reasons: the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, the decline in cash returns, the impact of the new crown epidemic and other macro-environmental impacts prompted the company to seek more diversified asset allocation plans. Looking back at the historical market, we can find that the Bitcoin price at that time was only around $11,000. From the perspective of later comers, it can be described as an accurate bottom hunting.*

*Soon after MicroStrategy announced the purchase of the first batch of bitcoins, bitcoin started a significant upswing, from around US$11,000 in August 2020 to a maximum of US$64,846.9 on April 14, 2021. Platform market data), but since then started a five-month volatile downward trend. During this period, MicroStrategy continued to raise Bitcoin.*

*As of the close of Nasdaq on December 2, 2021, MicroStrategy's total market value is 7.08 billion U.S. dollars, and the value of its holdings of Bitcoin is 6.841 billion U.S. dollars, which means that the total value of its holdings of Bitcoin has reached the company 96.62% of the total market value, compared with 71.76% in June this year, an increase of nearly 25%. Such a high proportion means that Bitcoin's rise and fall will directly affect MicroStrategy's stock price, and its trend is closely related to the ups and downs of the crypto market. It is precisely because of this that MicroStrategy's stock has also won the title of Bitcoin "shadow stock".*

Multiple debt issues to raise additional bitcoin

MicroStrategy has a record of borrowing to buy Bitcoin. As early as December 11, 2020 and February 19, 2021, MicroStrategy issued two notes, raising a total of 1.7 billion US dollars in funds, and will raise money. All funds are invested in Bitcoin. The most noteworthy thing is that MicroStrategys two bond issuances cleverly used "convertible notes" as a financial tool to obtain funds from the traditional market with a cost that is almost negligible. For betting on Bitcoin with high volatility, from the current results, it is clear that MicroStrategy is betting in the right direction.

On December 11, 2020, MicroStrategy announced that it has completed the issuance of a senior unsecured convertible note (Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes) valued at US$650 million. According to the Business Wire website, the annual interest rate of the convertible note is 0.750%. In 2021 Interest will be paid semiannually starting from June 15th, that is, interest will be paid once every year on June 15th and December 15th. The bill initially planned to raise US$400 million, but eventually the excess funds raised reached US$650 million, which to a certain extent reflected the attitude of the capital market towards the digital asset industry at that time. It is understood that the expiry date of the note is December 15, 2025, and investors can choose to convert the note into cash or MicroStrategy's Class A common stock, or a combination of the two. The agreed initial conversion ratio is 2.5126 MicroStrategy Class A stocks for the principal of the $1,000 note, which means that the investor buys its shares at a price of $397.99, and MicroStrategys closing price on December 8, 2020 is calculated at $289.45. The premium is about 37.50%, but if the latest closing price of MicroStrategy stock is calculated at $683.36, then the current floating profit of the creditors of MicroStrategy's financing has exceeded 130%.

On February 19, 2021, MicroStrategy once again completed the issuance of a $1.05 billion senior unsecured convertible note with a maturity date of February 15, 2027. The convertible note also allows investors to choose to convert it into cash, MicroStrategy Class A stock, or a combination of the two after maturity.

The initial conversion rate of the convertible note is 0.6981 MicroStrategy Class A shares for every US$1,000 note, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of US$1,432.46 per share. Compared with the closing price of US$955.00 on February 16, 2021, a premium of approximately Is 50.00%. In addition to the premium rate that shows that investors are enthusiastic about this round of financing, the interest paid by MicroStrategy's convertible notes can also be seen. The previous round was still 0.750%, and this round is directly with zero interest (the annual interest rate is 0%), and you only need to repay the principal after maturity. To be precise, this is not a regular zero-coupon bill. Zero-coupon bills are generally issued at a discount, while MicroStrategy is issued based on the face price. For these two debts worth up to $1.7 billion, MicroStrategy has to bear only $24.375 million in interest. From the point of view of the floating profit of MicroStrategys current Bitcoin holdings mentioned in the previous article, although it is less than a year since the completion of the first financing, the book income has already been more than ten times the interest it should pay, and Taking into account the impact of shadow stocks, the rise in the price of Bitcoin in the past two months has not only made MicroStrategy a fortune in the crypto market, but also increased its stock price. Compared with the low price in June this year, At present, MicroStrategy's stock price has gained a 48.16% increase.

MicroStrategy's last financing to buy Bitcoin occurred on June 7th of this year. In a report submitted by MicroStrategy to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it was mentioned that the company expects at least $284.5 million in impairment losses on Bitcoin investments in the second quarter. But then it was announced that it would issue Senior Secured Notes (Senior Secured Notes) worth 400 million U.S. dollars (later increased to 500 million U.S. dollars) to purchase Bitcoin at an annual interest rate of 6.125%, which will expire in 2028. However, because the entire crypto market was still immersed in the panic since the 5.19 drop, the crowd who was optimistic about the news in the capital market was obviously less than the previous two financings.

The opposition believes that MicroStrategys Bitcoin position is already too large, and it can even be regarded as the companys main business. If the price of Bitcoin continues to fall, this aggressive method of increasing positions may make MicroStrategy insolvent. Once it reaches this point, the huge bitcoin position it holds may become a bomb that will be thrown into the market at any time. Citibank even adjusted its rating to sell after MicroStrategy first claimed to issue convertible bonds for the purchase of bitcoins, and HSBC prohibited customers from buying MicroStrategy stocks. Fortunately, MicroStrategy once again bet on the right direction.

***MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has also changed his negative view of Bitcoin. He wrote in a prominent position on the homepage of the propaganda website operated by him: "Bitcoin is like a bank in cyberspace, through fair and credible rules. Run to provide a global, affordable, simple and safe savings account for billions of people who have no choice or do not want to run their own hedge funds."-----Michael Saylor.***

For some time now, with a group of enthusiasts, we have been creating a website that collects onchain data for 8,000 people. altcoins. I am curious what is the opinion of average investors on such data.

Do you think they can be used as a trading indicator more than technical analysis? Do you think that small cap tokens can be controlled by whales and that observing such charts will predict price movements?

Below, as an example, I am enclosing a chart of funds held on $ QNT portfolios in the 1.5kk - 2.5kk range

I have never really understood why people were that optimistic about Bitcoin. I don't want to spread FUD or criticize or anything, I would just like to hear what have to say about my thoughts.

When Bitcoin was new, it was a big thing. Decentralized digital money. But then Ethereum came and took the next step by essentially allowing anything digital to be decentralized. The token Eth was just the currency to reward the network maintainers. Now there are even more efficient and flexible protocols such as Solana, Avalanche, Harmony One, probably many more.

So I am just wondering, why, really, do people still expect Bitcoin will be relevant in 10 years from now? Again, I know this sub is very protective of Bitcoin and I am not trying to provoke FUD. I just really can't see why people would want to use Bitcoin to build the future of finance and would like to understand why so many people still believe it will stay around.

The current 'dip' is all that's being talked about here, so I'm assuming most of the complaints are coming from recent buy ins. Don't buy doing a hike if you don't wanna deal with correction prices.

Since September BTC had just been on the rise, hitting a new all time high. Those of you who believed that this would just keep going on are now in here talking about either "crypto sales" or "bear market" depending on your angle. The prices will go up again that's most likely, but this correction is perfectly healthy. Just because the market isn't continuing its bull run doesn't mean it's all going south. Since Saturday BTC's movement has been beautifully sideways. At this point most of the sell offs have most likely stopped. 

The direction of the market is upwards, but you're gonna have to get used to corrections and crashes if you wanna become a stronk HODLer!

Hey Reddit,  


I want to ask a question.  
As we are a small startup in the early stages and want to start marketing soon,  
we are asking ourself the question if Reddit or Twitter better for promoting  
showcases of our product. We are limited in our marketing and this is why we have  
to think about fokus. I know that the reach of most coins is better on Twitter, but on the  
other hand I think the better or more valueable audience which is better educated in crypto is  
to find on Reddit. Reddit communities in my opinion have the greater impact if you catch them in the right way.  


# But what do you think? Reddit or Twitter?

It really starts grinding my gears when people babble about their beloved crypto reaching at least 100$ worth per coin. People like that are speculating the price of their assets based on what ETH now is or BTC. Or even lower mcap like SOL or ADA. None of them actually understands how total supply comes into play.

Furthermore, I'd say that most people don't even glance over the whitepaper of the project. One could literally copy paste a script from a Scooby Doo episode and people would be still "IM PRETTY BULLISH ON THIS ONE".

[https://thecoinperspective.com/](https://thecoinperspective.com/?vs=dogecoin) is a good way to see how your crypto can rise by comparing it to marketcaps of other projects.  If people continue to invest into shitty rug pull projects they are stabbing themselves in the leg by putting money out of good projects into shit that gets pulled by single entity. 

Want crypto to succeed? Put your money into legit stuff.

I thought I would paint one vision of what might be in store for cryptocurrencies in 2022. Most of this is just an extrapolation of where were are today and stuff I came up with just to get people thinking and generate debate.

**More and more people will get into cryptos**

Crypto has had a great ride in 2021 when it comes to adoption. Most of this adoption has been in winning over financial institutions. In 2022, crypto will become  an investment vehicle for the masses. This will be spearheaded by banks acting as custodians and offering crypto based investment portfolios to their customers.

As the realization that blockchain is disrupting business models seeps into the public consciousness,  altcoins will be viewed as investment in tech startups. As a result the correlation between altcoins and Bitcoin will breakdown and greater emphasis will be placed on the fundamentals of each token. Good projects will receive substantial investment while lesser projects will flounder.

As more and more people start to interact with DeFi and staking; scalability and usability will become important. DeFi experiences that are **easy and cheap** to use for the ordinary person will become important.

**Digital identity will become important**

The traditional world the crypto world will continue to come together and unified through regulation. A key part of this will be KYC and AML laws. DeFi solutions that blend in KYC will become important.

This will give rise to the importance of digital identity solutions that allows for verification while maintaining privacy. 

**Low energy coins will become important**

The energy usage of cryptocurrencies will receive a lot of attention. POW will be viewed as wasteful and POS will be seen as a favorable alternative by lawmakers.

**NFT 2.0 will develop**

NFTs will be used to tokenize and fund music, film, and games development with holders getting a slice of the revenue. 

NFTs will move on from being associated with low quality jpg images to high quality artwork. The first ever art galley to physically show case digital NFTs will launch.

**Layer 1s will become invisible**

Layer 1 blockchains will increasingly be seen as infrastructure that DApp developers care about but DApp consumers are oblivious to. Alternatives to the EVM operating system will become popular similar to iOS and Android today.

The same DEX will exist on multiple blockchain platforms and liquidity will be aggregated across them. 

**Real world governance and Crypo governance will intermingle** 

The first ever governmental election recorded on a blockchain will happen in 2022. This will pave the way of governance of all sorts moving onto the blockchain from housing boards to stockholder voting.
-------------------------------
16391328622021-12-10
It is often said that NFTs do good things and make life easier in terms of event tickets, document storage and many other applications, precisely because they cannot be changed afterwards. The disadvantage that everything is really stored forever on this blockchain is not talked about.

That also makes me think that theoretically they can do a lot of damage. 

Hypothetically, anyone who wants to can publish private pictures or documents, which are then stored on the blockchain forever. 

Which might not be in the interest of the person in the picture or the documents of a company.

I know that theoretically someone can put things online and it's difficult to remove them from the internet again, but it's not completely impossible. 

What is your opinion on this? Am I overthinking this?

Im trying to understand DAOs. What book/vid/podcast can you recommend that helped you go from confused noob to confident dude(tte)?! I dont mind buying and reading books (I love books!), but I have a long daily commute to work, so audio books and podcasts are especially easy for me to put in some serious time..

Since I was busy studying for finals this week, I was unable to attend the polygon (MATIC) Zk summit. Is there anyone here who went to the conference, and how was it? Are you looking forward to the future? 

Vitalik Buterin was supposed to be at Polygon Summit, and they had a huge announcementwas it really that huge? Many "hyped" crypto announcements, in my experience, tend to disappoint. 

Anyway, I know I can look things up on the internet, but I wanted to have a discussion and see how people felt afterwards. 

Brief polygon info below: 
Polygon is a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Aggregating scalable solutions on Ethereum supporting a multi-chain Ethereum ecosystem.

Suspend belief and probability for a moment, and imagine a scenario. 

You have invested into a coin, lets call it WET coin, so people don't think I'm shilling. 

WET has been cruising along for a few weeks when suddenly a major announcement sends the price soaring. You thought there was a possibility of a good gain, say, 5X. But the price is moving past 30x right now, and still climbing. Momentum builds and more investors pile in. The subreddit sees thousands of new users - some of them new to crypto. As a veteran of the coin you even offer some opinions of your own.

Buy-ins and FOMO continue and now you are looking at a more than 500x on your investment. 

But then, tragedy. The announcement was fake. Nothing is happening, and there is no possibility that it will ever happen. The price drops. And it continues to drop. 

Screams of HODL and Buy the Dip echo across multiple subs, but staring down the possibility of losing a major gain, you decide to sell. You sell it all and take pride in your massive gain - roughly 350x your initial investment. You have done nothing wrong, you did your DD on a project and timed the market reasonably well. 

A few days pass and the price is still falling its now back to around the 10x from your original investment - a drop of 98% from its ATH. You feel justified and calm buy your decision making. You also still have some faith in the project, so you decide to put your original investment back in at the new price. The price appears to stabilise now and you seem to have done well, ready for a new pump in several years, if it ever happens. 

Then one thing happens that completely floors you. A post from a user on reddit catches your eye. Its a new investor who has lost big on WET. Down 97% on his original investment. He appears to have legitimately lost most of his life savings, and his family doesn't yet know about it. Users are hounding him about being so reckless. But something else startles you particularly. You recognise the name. It is a user that you have previously provided advice to - bad advice. More than that, the price he bought into WET at was exactly the same price you sold it for. 

It strikes you that, that the exact amount of this users loss is the same amount as your profit. You have done nothing wrong, and even that user likely knows that. 

WET has made you rich, but at the cost of another family's wellbeing. So, what do you do? Do you reveal the connection? Do you reach out? Do you smile and laugh maniacally? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: You get rich of a coin, and then discover another redditor here has lost everything by the same amount. What do you do?

I had no idea Reddit do such things as Reddit recaps, but it is not suprising. But this year  is also first time ( if I am not wrong), when users can check their own personal recaps, which include main subs where they were active.

Subreddit  where I spend  most of my time on Reddit was
...suprise...suprise... CryptoCurrency. I spend 197 hours here! In my second and third subreddits I spend just 10 hours each. 

197 hours in CC. Is it much or not? I have no idea, I compared it with just few people, and they are much more active than average user, so they are not good comparation. I am really curious how are your stats? Is CryptoCurrency the sub where you spend most of your Reddit time. How many hours you spend here?


How to check your personal recap?

In desktop reddit there is blue narwhal ( dolphin with  horn) logo near  chat and notification logos. You can't miss it. In mobile you need to click "home". There you will see two updates from reddit. First one is "It's been a year, 2021", this is  whole Reddit recap. Next one near it is your personal recap. I had problem with checking my recap on mobile, but it worked fine on desktop reddit.

And little easter egg, everyone in their personal recap get their own  character card (kinda like cards in MTG or Yu-Gi-Oh). Your avatar, number of karma  and unique skill. There are many different skills, which one you will get depend from type of sub, where you spend most of your time. I saw skills like political shielding  or game sense. There is (which suprised me a little...positively of course) also crypto skill you can get: "Crypto Keeper" skill, with...little spoiler..."+5% crypto gains and +5000% chance to talk crypto with every one you see". 
Ha, ha, ha... very funny Reddit. I do not talk about crypto to everyone I see... Ok maybe I do. Do I?

The pace of Bitcoin price losses has gained momentum as it failed to hold on to the upward momentum it experienced following last weeks flash crash.

But Nuggy is embracing the volatility and confidently buying the dip.

The comments come from Bitcoin slipping around 6% on Thursday, before regaining some ground on Friday, after it could not hold the important $50,000 price level. Other digital currencies were also down.

Mr Chicky says: Its been a wild few days for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which have been swinging between price gains and losses.

 Since the 20% flash crash last weekend  which was triggered by a wider risk-off sentiment that also impacted many areas of global stock markets  Bitcoin had been making small gains over the last few days.

But it has failed to hold on to this momentum after not being able to hold above $50,000.

This is an important threshold and the failure to secure it will likely spook some traders.

He continues: However, like many serious crypto investors, Im embracing this short-term volatility for longer-term gains. 

Im using the lower prices of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies to top-up my portfolio. Why? Because like many major corporations, financial institutions, governments, prestigious universities, and household-name investing legends, Im confident that digital currencies are the inevitable future of money.

In our increasingly tech-driven, globalised world, it makes sense to hold digital, borderless, decentralised currencies.

In addition, adoption and demand are increasing all the time, whilst at the same time, supply is decreasing.

The Nugget boss is seemingly not the only one taking this approach. The third-largest holder of Bitcoin added more than $150 million of the cryptocurrency to their holdings following last weekends flash crash.

Figures from BitInfoCharts show the investor purchased more than 3,000 Bitcoins over the last of the last few days.

Such whales, which are individuals or entities that hold enough cryptocurrency to have the potential to move currency valuations, shrug off concerns about dips, use them as buying opportunities, and focus on long-term trends. This approach alone has the power to push crypto values up, affirms Mr Nuggy.

He concludes: Despite the recent turbulence, the trajectory of Bitcoin and other major cryptos is upwards. I would not be surprised to see Bitcoin reach $100,000 in the first half of 2022.

People talk about revolutionary NFT in games, NFT games, crypto earn games and so on.

The bottom line is that the vast majority of crypto games are classic crap. Like literally.

Completely boring, earn games, or pay to win games, and in most of them you have to put a lot of money investment to start playing and maybe enjoy that game.  

There are two games I play that are fun for me, and another is in sight. 

If youre interested Ill tell you what they are, but I didnt mention them because some people may think that I am shilling those games.

I know I know, the main point of crypto is decentralization, but in the current market, usability wins big time.

My grandma won't use crypto until she can pay for groceries with it.

My uncle won't use crypto until he can send bitcoin to his contacts without having to stress over tens of addresses with scrambled characters impossible to memorize.

My niece won't use it until it's as fast as an app or a website launching on her computer.

And I'm 1% of my whole family tree who manages to use crypto in the decentralized, yet bone chilling way. 

Thing is, CEXes have been much more successful at implementing these necessities than DEXes. We either need DEXes that are ACTUALLY for the average joe, or we have to support CEXes when it comes to pushing adoption forward.

Decentralized solutions for this trilemma, on the other hand, would be the preferred future of crypto, and I think every project should strive to make it safer, easier, and quicker.

Ive been in crypto for five years.  I remember trading on poloniex when it was a massive chat room that people would abuse to pump and dump shit coins.  I remember when BTC hit $1400 and I told my friend not to by because we were at an ATH and the market was toppy (I wasnt technically wrong, it did go down only to shoot up a few months later sorry bro).  I even remember the Mt Gox hack that shook the crypto community at the time. Those fuckers got off with a lotta good stuff, and led to the shut down one of the best exchanges. It was kind of like the Wild West, this new exciting world was opening and no one knew where it was going. One thing everyone involved at that time shared, though, was a belief in the concept of blockchain and its potential to change the world.  

Something pretty significant changed this year.  Theres been an influx of dumb money and people looking to use crypto as a platform to get rich quick.  It makes sense, I feel like thats the case with just about anything that is new and in demand. But honestly, I miss the good old days.  Yes, we are still early in terms of adoption and implementation.  But it is a different time now.  Just about everyone who knows how to use the internet has heard the world Bitcoin once in their life at this point.  Hell, BTC is listed as a currency next to USD on CNN.  If that isnt mainstream, idk what is. 

I see a bright future for crypto and blockchain, and Im very excited for where it goes next.  But I cant wait for this next bear market to come and wash clean the ranks of lite investors who dont care about what this technology is all about. I love widespread adoption, but I hate it when people just throw money at trends with no regard for what theyre investing in. While the number of investors who actually invest on an understanding and regard for the technology has increased, the percentage of crypto investors who invest on these principles has decreased due to mass adoption and dilution of smart money by dumb money.  

In order for something to have value, it has to actually do something. Crypto actually does something beyond go up, which is something this new wave of investors doesnt really seem to care much about. Its the tangible recognition and adoption of this utility that produces value for an asset.  Im excited for the days where more people again recognize the true value of crypto.

I experienced someone attempting to access my email account while I was at work. My phone is synced to my watch so I saw the notification and ran to my phone to check whats up. I denied the request as it came through my authenticator app within a minute of it happening. Im not entirely sure how this happened, I feel like I was pretty secure. 

Anyway I need to go ahead and create a new email address but cant decide what platform to go with. Ill be using this exclusively for crypto and **nothing** else. What do you recommend? Im based out of Canada if that makes any difference. Also, why do you use the email platforms that you do? Do you have a personal account AND a crypto account?

Hi all, new to the Crypto space and need a little help - I am currently looking to invest in a few projects and in turn want to review the historical trends / patterns of these projects (last 3-5 years) before jumping in. Anyone able to advise which application / website is best to offer this information? 

I currently use the standard Coinbase Pro exchange as well as the Kraken pro exchange but find info quite limiting on both. Any recommendations / suggestions welcomed. 

Thanks very much in advance.

&gt;A hard spoon is a meta-protocol on top of a blockchain creating a token that inherits the blockchains underlying tokens balances. The idea of a soft spoon would be to create two competing \*branches of a protocol\* within \*the same blockchain.\*  Vitalik Buterin

The term Hard Spoon was first coined by Jae Kwon, Founder, and CEO of [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint). A Hard Spoon involves the creation of a newly minted cryptocurrency, on a different blockchain, for a cryptocurrency that is already in existence. The account balances are replicated from the existing cryptocurrency. Essentially, you end up with two cryptocurrencies that are run parallel on different blockchains, where each has its own value, can be used for staking, and is also tradeable.

&gt;Hard spoon: a new chain that takes into account state from an existing chain; not to compete, but to provide broad access.Jae Kwon

The Hard Spoon allows for cryptocurrencies to exist on multiple blockchains while taking existing account balances into consideration. This allows current token or coin holders to receive the same amount of newly minted tokens or in any other ratio that is not 1:1 based on an account balance snapshot that can be used prior to distribution.

A key component of the Hard Spoon is that it is non-contentious. It is not intended to result in competition or steal market share from the original chain. The goal is to provide broader access to a cryptocurrency by replicating a coin or tokens account balances and minting a parallel cryptocurrency that functions on a divergent blockchain. This is bound to offer greater efficiency and boost performance over time.

&gt;A key takeaway here is that this allows a new world of developers and programmers to work with existing community members from the original chain to ultimately explore the platform and improve on any deficiencies.

Hard Spoons provide mobility to avoid blockchain-based restrictions and help expand a cryptocurrencys reach and thus promote greater use and adoption.

For example, if a cryptocurrency were initially launched on the Ethereum Blockchain, but the team found a faster, interoperable blockchain to utilize for its token purpose, it could conduct a Hard Spoon. This involves taking the account balance of existing holders of the specific cryptocurrency and replicating the token or coin to function on a divergent blockchain that better suits its needs. Both cryptocurrencies would be functional.

Just wanted to ask if you all still think otherwise?
Maybe it's different or slower as before but I get more and more the feeling of 2017.
We could as well be already in the bear market right now it wouldn't surprise me.
Don't come with your Hur dur we are only below Ath 5%&lt; that's now what I'm saying. I say it might as well be the start of it all. Felt the same way back then and if we get another big run up I would look for an exit or get warm clothes for another winter.

As said, just my gut but after reading countless posts about hopium I wanted to post about this.

Think about every minute you arent on looking charts, you spent here or reading through posts and articles around a new coin.
Imagine you just decide for yourself to always buy and hold that one coin and the only time you actually interact is when you buy frequently after getting your pay check.
You can spend that time instead on making more money or doing what you love. If you truly believe in Crypto - who knows if checking it once a year might be the healthiest play for yourself.
Ever had those thoughts? Close to just setting an Alarm for a new ATH for all my coins and just never care again lol

Omicron is weighing a little on market, but crypto is not mutual funds. Crypto is something lots of young people trade and sell on a whim. Christmas is coming up and people need cash for tvs and presents and stuff....

Everyone wants to make it more complicated than that or promote whale conspiracies, but retail is a powerful force in the crypto market. US crypto regulation isn't out yet, which is holding back large investors, so we are mainly seeing a reflection of what's going on in the lives of retail traders.

This is why Doge is a thing and Shib and why the price of gaming coins go crazy even though no one has even played the games yet. People want to score some great holiday deals right now and they have some Eth but no cash, what do you think they are going to do? Don't overthink it, folks.

Gaming industry is huge. For e.g. GTA 5 earned $1 billion in its first three days of launch. That is insane.

There are several NFT gaming metaverses that I think are promising. FPS are more my style, and SidusHeroes looks exciting and I think it might set a new standard for FPS-style NFT games.

Now with NFTs in games changes the whole system. Imagine playing a game that's built with NFTs. You can earn tokens throughout the game missions and challenges. You can buy and sell items using those tokens. And you can convert those tokens to fiat. On top of that if you hold the tokens, their value would go up as time passes.

NFTs will change the future of gaming. The tech is fairly new so it'll take some time to become mainstream. But when it does, it'll do wonders in the gaming community.

If you are into gaming and also see the potential, There are several NFT gaming metaverses that I think are promising. FPS are more my style, and [SidusHeroes.com](https://SidusHeroes.com) looks exciting and I think it might set a new standard for FPS-style NFT games.

Elon Musk's hyping, China and India banning, Evergrande defaulting, debts and political shenanigans and whatnot - not saying they don't have a negative impact on the market anymore, but it's significantly less impactful than before.

It's like Bitcoin falls a percent and then be like "eehhh, no." and either soar even higher than before or just stay stagnant for a while.

Meme coins are not gone for good, I'm afraid, but still the disgusting manipulations are getting weaker and weaker.

Oh also crypto and the holders don't give a shit about anywhere banning crypto anymore. It's not like it was unexpected - crypto solves people's problem and so the governments and banks are generally against it, but soon when they realize it's no use, they'll adopt the technology.

Until then, let's just take a glance at the FUD and laugh!

Hi everyone, 
So when metahero announced everdome, someone created that coin with the exact name and time(i didn't knew at time of investing that the coin will be launched in jan)
So I invested 20$ into the project and its worth 800$ now, but the scammers have disabled the selling option (ya just like squid game)
I dont know what to do now, the coin Market cap was 3 million on 3rd December and now it is around 131 millions at the time of writing this post.

 
Just wanted to aware everyone in this space to be aware of the scam coin, and please do not invest without analysing any coin and do the same mistake which I did.

I know, I know, coin price doesn't matter at all without considering the number of coins, it's all about market cap, no need to explain. I understand why coin creators create a quadrillion tokens to keep the coin price extremely low - it's for the very, very casual crowd that doesn't know what market cap is and just think that, if their coin went to $1, they would be rich. "BTC went to $69k so $1 should be possible, right?"

However, I, knowing that coin price doesn't matter, really wouldn't want to buy a coin worth $0.00000000...1 from a point of convenience alone. I want to be able to know at one glance how my coin developed since I bought it. I bought at $0.80 and now it's $1.21, I can immediately see how much that changed. Same if it was worth $37, $424 or even something in the thousands. 

That's not the case for meme coins with a quadrillion tokens. BABYDOGE is currently worth 0.000000001501, I would need to count zeros if I had bought at one point and wanted to see if it went down 99% or up 10,000% since I bought. Sure, it's a minor problem and usually I will rather just check a portfolio tracker, but it's annoying.

I hope, if this market ever matures a bit, we leave this phase of huuuge numbers of tokens behind us so coins have more "normal" prices - or, at the very least, that more serious new projects don't start doing this as well. Is this just me or are those prices with tons of zeros after the decimal point really off-putting to anyone else?

There is 1 main rule when it comes to markets

- Dont fight the Fed -

For the first time since BTCs inception monetary policy has changed. Most people involved in crypto have actually never faced a monetary policy change and most likely dont even know what that truly means..

Crypto and assets in general are in for a sizable downturn with a true recession looming.

Dont mean to spread doom and gloom. Not what this is about. Just want to make people aware since most have likely never  been through this!

Im currently wasting for almost 1 hour a scammer time who contacted me on Telegram, pretending to have a issue to my wallet full of $, but unfortunately I dont know why I cant access their websites to fix the problem.

But lets be honest, even if wasting their time is funny. At the end they will still continue to scam innocent people.

So I was wondering, is there a way to fuck up the scammers. 

Like a fake 12 words seeds that open a contaminated wallet (not sure if thats even possible, probably not).

Or a fake seed related to an anti-scammer group that will be able to track them back and shut them down.

Well if someone knows a more efficient way to mess with the scammers other than wasting their time, let me know.

In 2020 the average lifespan of the post war baby boomers was breached. This is an absolutely massive transfer of wealth from a group that has little interest in crypto, to a much more crypto literate group. 

Could this change everything about previous adoption speeds of crypto and market cap growth?

Is it possible that what we think are financial institutions moving large amounts of money into crypto may also be 30 and 40 year olds  trying to find a modern place for fiat that has been locked up for years out of the economy? 

Could this be the push crypto needs to never look back?

# "Wallet" is a bad term

The term "wallet" should not be used except for when briefly introducing the world of crypto to your grandparents. It is an excellent analogy for no-coiners, but it has become ambigously used and fails to describe the necessary tools for the new decentralized economy.

The term "wallet" can refer to:

1. ***FULL*** *software* (application) used to transact your crypto, without the need for any complementary piece of  "wallet" software/hardware. E.g. using MetaMask "as is".
2. ***JUST*** the safe *storage of your secret* used to sign transaction. E.g. a Ledger Nano S. This phyiscal device is often called a "hardware wallet", but it cannot be used alone to make a transaction. It has no internet connection and you do not input recipient address and amount on the device it self.
3. ***PARTIAL*** software, only sofrware for preparing a yet-to-be-signed-transaction but **NOT** *any signing key.* E.g. MetaMask + Ledger Nano S.

Also note that when using 3) Partial software + Hardware wallet, in case of MetaMask+Ledger Nano X on macOS, as of late you [might need Ledger Live as an "envoy" to bridge](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020871157-Solving-a-MetaMask-connection-issue-?support=true) between MetaMask and Ledger Nano.

The term "wallet" is ambigous in two dimension! It both has multiple meanings, as seen by 1-3 above, while also in scenario 2) and 3) we need *multiple* *different "wallets"* in order to transact. This is quite complex for beginners and made extra confusing by the poor use of the term "wallet". Let's fix this.

The purpose of this post is not to rant. I want something to come out of this post! I wanna create either a [SLIP (Satoshi Labs Improvment Proposal)](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips)or a [BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) and try to cement a new unambigous, clear and educating terminoloy. ***But before doing so I need input from you all!***

# C.A.N.E. / C.A.N.

I suggest we find a new universal terminology, resulting in an easy to pronounce acronym. A bad first attempt: ***C.A.N.(E.)*** *=* ***C****onstruction,* ***A****uthentication,* ***N****etworking, (****E****nvoy)*

With ***E****nvoy* in parenthesis since it is not always used.

1. *Constructor*:  Is the building of a transaction. For a simple token transfer this often includes recipient address, amount and sometimes fee and memo. User inputs this information, which often gets validated and sometimes it keeps track of a nonce, which is included in the transaction. Alternative terms: Builder
2. *Authenticator:* Is the signing of (hash of) the transaction, can take place in the same software as the *Construction* but does not have to, in case of a Ledger Nano is used, the Ledger Nano is the *Authenticator.* Alternative term: Signer
3. *Networker:* Is the broadcasting of the signature (signed transaction) to the network (to the DLT via some node/API). This can be software running on a different machine algotether, typically for paranoid supergeeks (respect!) using "air gapped" computers. I.e. the *Construction* of the transaction might take place on an air gapped computer and *Authentication* might be done using Ledger Nano and broadcasint of the signed transaction - *Networking  -* might take place on another non air-gapped computer. Alternative terms: Broadcaster, Relayer, Publisher, Dispatcher
4. (*Envoy):* This is seldomly used, but in case of Ledger Nano and MetaMask (Chrome macOS 2021) [one might need to use Ledger Live as a bridge](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020871157-Solving-a-MetaMask-connection-issue-?support=true), as an envoy between MetaMask and the Ledger Nano device. Alternative term: Bridge, Connector, Interactor

These four components can themselves be broken down into several subcomponents, but that is out of scope and not necessary (especially the *Constructor*). 

# Analogy

For newcomers we can still explain these four compnents with analogy in the real world (which is what the bad term "wallet" tries to do). Imagine you are sending a letter with the postal serivce, then: *Constructor* is you when you write the letter, and the recipient postal address on the envelop. Authenticator is you when you sign the letter "Best regards Alice", seal the envelop and write your return address on the back of the envelop. Networker is the postal office or letter box you take the envelop to in order to get it sent. And Envoy is an optional friend of yours you can take the envelop to the postal office or letter box instead of you.

Not a perfect analogy I admit, but neither was "wallet".

# Alternatives

Now these specific words - instead of their synonyms - were used to create an easy pronounced acronym. In case of 4) Envoy not being used, the acronym CAN (yes the meaning toilet is unfortunate )is still easy to pronounce.

Unfortunately most alternative terms are consonant, all but Authenticator have an alternative term staring with the letter B. If we would have a term on B for authenitactor we could have imagined using ***B4 (***=BBBB***)*** to describe the four components.

If we replace *Envoy* with *Bridge* and change the order, we can form ***BANC*** but do we really want to think about the homonym *bank*? 

If we replace *Envoy* with *Interactor* and change the order, we can form ***INCA,*** but since the Envoy/Interactor is not always used then that simpler scenario would be ***NCA*** which is not as easily pronounced. We could of course go for ***ANCI*** and ***ANC.*** But ANC is already used for African National Congress, maybe not a problem though.

# So "CANE Wallet"?

No, nope, absolutely not. We should completely stop using the term "wallet", everywhere. I'm aiming for ***just*** CANE, or well &lt;insert better acronym&gt;. So rather "Bitcoin CANE", "Ethereum CANE" or "Multi asset CANE". And yes, "Polka(dot) Cane" is funny ("polkagris" in Swedish).

# So "hardware CANE"?

No, just "hardware authenticator" or "hardware signer". Or just "smartcard" which is what it is. 

# So "hot CANE"/"cold CANE"?

No not "cold CANE". Just CANE. But what about "hot CANE"? No, "custodial asset manager" or something. We should try to find a good term for this as well. We should not try to 1:1 map the old usage pattern with wallet with a new term. 

# How can you help?

As I said above, I would like us in the community to stop using "wallet" and start using precis, unambigious terminology which does not conflate or obfuscate the different components used to transact with a DLT network. 

You can start by identifying a better break down of the components than my four above. Ask yourself if they can be used to describe the three different meanings of wallet above (Full software, Partial software, Just storage of secret) and their usage scenarios?

Can you come up with a clear naming of these (or alternative combination of components?). Can they form an easy to pronounce (and remember) acronym? Or maybe form a word using more than one letter per component/term?

Since component 4) Envoy is not always used, it would be good if the resulting acronym also works if one removes that component from it.

# What's next?

After we as a community can come up with a great breakdown and naming of the components forming an easy to pronounce (and remember) new term, then I'll give it a go to write a SLIP or a BIP (but most likely a SLIP) and try to get it cemented and used through out the various ecosystems. Starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum software most likely.

# Is this likely to happen?

Probably not, but that does not discourage me to try.

Hallo guys:),

i have a question i am pretty new to the NFT space. And i know there is very much scam in this! So the case, I have a WL for a great NFT project where i can mint 2 NFTs, but I want just mint one! One guys asked in the chat if somebody could help him and mint 1 for him, so I am thinking about it! I really want to help and not scam him also he would pay me 200 euro extra, how it would go: he would sent my the ETH money FIRST! Than i would mint the 2 NFTs and sent him after it one through OpenSea. I know it sounds too good to be true but where is the risk for me if he sends the ETH FIRST.He would only get my ETH adress for it. Or if i do it how i should do it safe maybe with secound MM account? What are your tipps guys! Maybe sending NFT through Opensea is not safe and i can transfer it to MM and send it to him through MM? Maybe i dont see something, looking for your advices guys! Thank you:)

Title.                

Source: https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think                

The article itself is way too long to digest here, so here are the important snippets.

&gt;Those who have been tempted by cryptocurrencies might also want to think carefully about the environmental impact of the transactions they conduct. Vast amounts of computing power are needed for the so-called proof of work algorithm that is used to validate transactions on Blockchain's distributed ledger system. One recent study estimated that **BitCoin alone is responsible for around 22m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every year  greater than all the carbon footprint of the whole of Jordan.**                   

&gt;**Watching online videos accounts for the biggest chunk of the world's internet traffic  60%  and generates 300m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, which is roughly 1% of global emissions, according to French think tank, The Shift Project.** This is because, as well as the power used by devices, energy is consumed by the servers and networks that distribute the content.                

The Ethereum blockchain is supposed to switch to proof of stake in the first half of 2022, meaning that the present carbon footprint it has will drop by 99.9%. Another factor to consider is that if NFTs ceased to exist today, it wouldn't change the carbon footprint of the Ethereum blockchain, or rather, its impact would be minimal.                 

Let's make a hypothetical for a moment. You have two instances where you have cows raised and then slaughtered. You have one cow that is raised and slaughtered by a family that just wants to eat some steak for one night. The rest of the cow goes to waste. The other cow has every single piece of it put to use except the bones: skin turned to leather, beef ribs Monday night, ground beef Tuesday night, steak Wednesday night, and so on.                 

This post was somewhat inspired by the backlash Ubisoft has faced from implementing NFTs on the Tezos blockchain. I've seen mainstream journalists spreading misinformation about Ubisoft, figuratively speaking, boiling the oceans with NFTs even though they were put on the Tezos blockchain and no normies went out of their way to do research on what Tezos is or the fact that it is far less Carbon-producing than Eth.

So Ubisoft Quartz came out and we can get 3 free NFT. The image I show below shows they limited the first NFT to 2,000 and the other 2 look like you need 600 hours of play time and 100 hours. There is no way to get those free, and I don't think we have enough time anyways. Most likely the other 2 will be limited by 2,000 give or take also.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I'm going to show you how to get access to Ubisoft Quartz for free. 

Note: this will require a computer that can run the game and you meet the other requirements other than needing lvl 5 in Tom Clancys Ghost Recon Breakpoint.

1. Again, make sure you have everything else done on this page [https://quartz.ubisoft.com/faq/requirements/who-can-acquire-digits](https://quartz.ubisoft.com/faq/requirements/who-can-acquire-digits)
2. Make sure you have Epic [https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/)
3. Get the demo of the required game. Note this is the full game but with a time trail. So note the download [https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/ghost-recon-breakpoint--free-demo](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/ghost-recon-breakpoint--free-demo)
4. Simply play the game until you hit level 5. Honestly, the best way to do it is ignore the mission and just kill everything that gets you points. This seems to be the fastest way. Note you can make yourself a bullet sponge by lowering the difficulty and everything and it makes this task that much easier. Note the demo has something like a 5 or 6 hour trail. 
5. Go here and click setup [https://quartz.ubisoft.com/dashboard](https://quartz.ubisoft.com/dashboard)
6. I'm going to be using a hardware wallet Ledger. So I select Temple. I had to download the browser extension, link it to ledger, and then make sure my ad block was off on the browser extension and Ubisoft's site to get it to work.

I got pissed after this point because I didn't know it was to this limit. I thought it was a time limit on us getting this. But there is only 2,000 NFT to get. IDK if all 3 will do this, but the first one was that. Anyways, click explore all digits and this will show up. 

https://preview.redd.it/csrvuhb46o481.png?width=1867&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=435b758e013f9e5d9cb15c510f01a82fd4ddefc0

I'm assuming you have to click a button when the other 2 are up. Looking at the other 2 something I didn't noticed before is you need to have 600 hours (25 days) logged for the next and then 100 (4.16 days) for the pants.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I started my crypto journey with a small investment. I wanted to learn by investing in small amounts as I was not so sure about it. I used to get 10 to 20% profits easily in march April of 2021. I left my work and started focusing on this. 

I was thinking more out of it. And I started holding it more and got stuck in a few altcoins. And then with time, I made the list of my decisions and it is going quite well now.

My learnings out of crypto are :

- Hold the valuable coins like BTC BNB ETH
- Trade for the short term like 15 days 1 month in coins like AVAX, LINK, BAKE, SAND
- Make short trades like 5% 3% 2% gains in altcoins which are at the extreme dips.

Be patient for the dip. Use Fibonacci to find out levels of your buying and make 1st profit 2nd profit 3rd profit.

Fix your targets and don't crave for more especially watching youtube videos or others who are gaining more than you at that moment.

Set your goals but don't lose it all...

Always makes me laugh when the market dips we get a loads of posts running along roughly this narrative:

*Buy the dip! Isn't this what you were waiting for?! Now's your chance, if you don't buy now, you don't deserve to reap the benefits of the pump!!!*

But when the market keeps on dipping in the following days, they all dry up. Next we get all the moaners come along and whine because they bought a dip but not THE DIP and got left behind with no more fiat. Some people really need to learn how to draw trend lines. Look at the past, when the bear comes, he doesn't usually just come for a day. After the initial dip, I always wait it out for a few days and just observe. They will often set up bull traps along the way. Once a trend seems to emerge, draw yourself trend lines along the peaks and the bottoms, set yourself a target price. The next bull run won't leave you behind, there's no need to panic buy. Once the price breaks out of the trend you will see this as it will no longer follow the tunnel lines you've drawn but maybe go sideways for a few days. That's usually the best time to buy.

Just remember the whales always play the same game, every time. They try to tempt people to pull the price higher with optimistic pumps. When the market's overworked and seems to have no more energy/faith to go higher, they start dumping. You can usually tell when a whale has dumped because the drop in price looks like a steep wall. After that they wait a few days. They might set up a bull trap or just wait if retail catches on to their game and starts playing ball. If nobody is buying their shit, they carry on dumping until it reaches their target prices.

Don't get played for a sucker this time.

This post is particularly for those who have little to no idea about Market Cap.

People new to crypto often fall prey to the shillers offering millions of tokens at just $10 or so. The boom of dogecoin and it's peers have just added fuel to the sale of memecoins which are often scams or rugpulls. Even if they aren't, that doesn't mean it's a good investment.

The value and room for growth of any Cryptocurrency is determined by it's Marketcap. The market cap of a token is calculated by multiplying the value of one coin into the total supply of the coin.

If a coin has the value of $0.0001 a piece and the market cap of $100 billion and you buy a million tokens thinking it'll make you a millionaire someday, you are WRONG!
This token will NEVER go to $1. For it to reach $1 the market cap of the crypto would have to be $1 Quadrillion Which is IMPOSSIBLE! Even Bitcoin, the OG, doesn't have that marketcap. 

That being said, while checking the marketcap is important,if the token is deflationary you should check the minimum supply it will have in the future and then calculate it's highest possible growth.

If there is something I need to add or correct, please comment it.

At some point everyone at least tried to buy Doge or Shib or Floki etc. They claim that they are useless, overhyped tokens that might die. Well, firstly let me clear that I dont hold any of them either.

But isnt the world going crazy and stupid day by day? We can see how stupid dances get millions of likes and informative videos have around just 1k. People love to do things esp todays generation, that is stupid, foolish and nonsensical.

So yes, after mass adoption, these fool might load themselves with coins that are as stupid as them.

For the past few days, some of my friends have been telling me how much they regret not having invested in cryptos. Basically, having a hindsight bias, everything seems to be in your control but while in reality it is not. While for the uninitiated, crypto sounds like a super highway to money, it has so many risks. I generally give people the example of TRIGGERS(TRIG) because I was personally invested in that. TRIG crypto turned out to be such a scam. It had so many big names associated to it and today it is burnt to the ground. Its value is almost zero. I am sure others would have also had their fingers burnt. Thoughts ?

Okay peeps,

it seems like were finally entering the bear market with big discounts and a lot of dips everybody was wishing for. Including me. My issue is that I bought a few of the previous dips in the last 2 weeks and now Im broke. Cant buy anything at the moment so I heavily rely on another big green pump. But IF Im right and were entering a beat market, what would you do?

Im just going to sit and watch, because I dont have money left for dips. On the other hand Ill do research and try to find out if theres a good way to hedge against a bear market. Maybe with stablecoins or some kind of bonds (like in the stock market).

What is your opinion?

I've recently waded into cryptocurrency and am working on understanding everything much better. I have a basic grasp of how the blockchain technology works, but I still struggle to explain to people what I'm actually investing money in and why the technology is so significant.  


As much as I dislike their privacy practices, if someone had asked me 15ish years ago to pitch to them how Google would change the Internet, I would have said something along the lines of how to Google search bar would make the consumption of information so much easier blah blah blah.  


I'm struggling to do the same with crypto and so I wanted to come here and ask for your cryptocurrency elevator pitch. If a total boomer came to you and said 'I have a $100, why should I put it into crypto?' what would you say?

**On December 9th, Phunware, an enterprise cloud office software company, announced that it had purchased another 100 bitcoins for approximately US$4.975 million in cash, at an average price of approximately US$49,750 per bitcoin. As of December 9, 2021, Phunware holds a total of approximately 630 bitcoins. The total purchase price of these bitcoins is approximately US$36.8 million, and the average purchase price is approximately US$58,513 per right bitcoin.**

***In the same breath, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor tweeted that he bought 1,434 bitcoins for about $82.4 million in cash. As of Dec. 9, the company held about 122,478 bitcoins with a total purchase price of $3.66 billion, or an average price of about $29,861 per bitcoin.***

According to documents submitted by MicroStrategy to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last Monday, the company purchased 7,002 bitcoins in October and November at a cost of US$414 million, with an average price of US$59,187 per bitcoin. After completing this "purchase", the total number of bitcoins held by MicroStrategy has exceeded 120,000Although most investors in the crypto market have only one or two years of understanding of MicroStrategy, the development process of MicroStrategy has exceeded 30 years. In November 1989, MicroStrategy was established in Tysons Corner, Virginia, USA. It is an enterprise that provides business intelligence, data analysis, mobile software development, and cloud computing. For 30 years after its establishment, MicroStrategy has always adhered to its leadership. In terms of business, it has not been reported that it has any intersection with encrypted assets. Even the company's CEO Michael Saylor (Michael Saylor) criticized Bitcoin on social platforms in 2013.

*However, with the arrival of the bull market in the crypto market in 2020 and the increasing risk of uncertainty in the global economic environment, Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy under his leadership did not escape the "law of true fragrance" in the end. On August 11, 2020, MicroStrategy suddenly announced that it had bought $250 million worth of Bitcoin, and thus became the world's first public company to publicly allocate Bitcoin as an asset. In this regard, MicroStrategy gave the following reasons: the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, the decline in cash returns, the impact of the new crown epidemic and other macro-environmental impacts prompted the company to seek more diversified asset allocation plans. Looking back at the historical market, we can find that the Bitcoin price at that time was only around $11,000. From the perspective of later comers, it can be described as an accurate bottom hunting.*

*Soon after MicroStrategy announced the purchase of the first batch of bitcoins, bitcoin started a significant upswing, from around US$11,000 in August 2020 to a maximum of US$64,846.9 on April 14, 2021. Platform market data), but since then started a five-month volatile downward trend. During this period, MicroStrategy continued to raise Bitcoin.*

*As of the close of Nasdaq on December 2, 2021, MicroStrategy's total market value is 7.08 billion U.S. dollars, and the value of its holdings of Bitcoin is 6.841 billion U.S. dollars, which means that the total value of its holdings of Bitcoin has reached the company 96.62% of the total market value, compared with 71.76% in June this year, an increase of nearly 25%. Such a high proportion means that Bitcoin's rise and fall will directly affect MicroStrategy's stock price, and its trend is closely related to the ups and downs of the crypto market. It is precisely because of this that MicroStrategy's stock has also won the title of Bitcoin "shadow stock".*

Multiple debt issues to raise additional bitcoin

MicroStrategy has a record of borrowing to buy Bitcoin. As early as December 11, 2020 and February 19, 2021, MicroStrategy issued two notes, raising a total of 1.7 billion US dollars in funds, and will raise money. All funds are invested in Bitcoin. The most noteworthy thing is that MicroStrategys two bond issuances cleverly used "convertible notes" as a financial tool to obtain funds from the traditional market with a cost that is almost negligible. For betting on Bitcoin with high volatility, from the current results, it is clear that MicroStrategy is betting in the right direction.

On December 11, 2020, MicroStrategy announced that it has completed the issuance of a senior unsecured convertible note (Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes) valued at US$650 million. According to the Business Wire website, the annual interest rate of the convertible note is 0.750%. In 2021 Interest will be paid semiannually starting from June 15th, that is, interest will be paid once every year on June 15th and December 15th. The bill initially planned to raise US$400 million, but eventually the excess funds raised reached US$650 million, which to a certain extent reflected the attitude of the capital market towards the digital asset industry at that time. It is understood that the expiry date of the note is December 15, 2025, and investors can choose to convert the note into cash or MicroStrategy's Class A common stock, or a combination of the two. The agreed initial conversion ratio is 2.5126 MicroStrategy Class A stocks for the principal of the $1,000 note, which means that the investor buys its shares at a price of $397.99, and MicroStrategys closing price on December 8, 2020 is calculated at $289.45. The premium is about 37.50%, but if the latest closing price of MicroStrategy stock is calculated at $683.36, then the current floating profit of the creditors of MicroStrategy's financing has exceeded 130%.

On February 19, 2021, MicroStrategy once again completed the issuance of a $1.05 billion senior unsecured convertible note with a maturity date of February 15, 2027. The convertible note also allows investors to choose to convert it into cash, MicroStrategy Class A stock, or a combination of the two after maturity.

The initial conversion rate of the convertible note is 0.6981 MicroStrategy Class A shares for every US$1,000 note, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of US$1,432.46 per share. Compared with the closing price of US$955.00 on February 16, 2021, a premium of approximately Is 50.00%. In addition to the premium rate that shows that investors are enthusiastic about this round of financing, the interest paid by MicroStrategy's convertible notes can also be seen. The previous round was still 0.750%, and this round is directly with zero interest (the annual interest rate is 0%), and you only need to repay the principal after maturity. To be precise, this is not a regular zero-coupon bill. Zero-coupon bills are generally issued at a discount, while MicroStrategy is issued based on the face price. For these two debts worth up to $1.7 billion, MicroStrategy has to bear only $24.375 million in interest. From the point of view of the floating profit of MicroStrategys current Bitcoin holdings mentioned in the previous article, although it is less than a year since the completion of the first financing, the book income has already been more than ten times the interest it should pay, and Taking into account the impact of shadow stocks, the rise in the price of Bitcoin in the past two months has not only made MicroStrategy a fortune in the crypto market, but also increased its stock price. Compared with the low price in June this year, At present, MicroStrategy's stock price has gained a 48.16% increase.

MicroStrategy's last financing to buy Bitcoin occurred on June 7th of this year. In a report submitted by MicroStrategy to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it was mentioned that the company expects at least $284.5 million in impairment losses on Bitcoin investments in the second quarter. But then it was announced that it would issue Senior Secured Notes (Senior Secured Notes) worth 400 million U.S. dollars (later increased to 500 million U.S. dollars) to purchase Bitcoin at an annual interest rate of 6.125%, which will expire in 2028. However, because the entire crypto market was still immersed in the panic since the 5.19 drop, the crowd who was optimistic about the news in the capital market was obviously less than the previous two financings.

The opposition believes that MicroStrategys Bitcoin position is already too large, and it can even be regarded as the companys main business. If the price of Bitcoin continues to fall, this aggressive method of increasing positions may make MicroStrategy insolvent. Once it reaches this point, the huge bitcoin position it holds may become a bomb that will be thrown into the market at any time. Citibank even adjusted its rating to sell after MicroStrategy first claimed to issue convertible bonds for the purchase of bitcoins, and HSBC prohibited customers from buying MicroStrategy stocks. Fortunately, MicroStrategy once again bet on the right direction.

&amp;#x200B;

***MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has also changed his negative view of Bitcoin. He wrote in a prominent position on the homepage of the propaganda website operated by him: "Bitcoin is like a bank in cyberspace, through fair and credible rules. Run to provide a global, affordable, simple and safe savings account for billions of people who have no choice or do not want to run their own hedge funds."-----Michael Saylor.***

Stablecoins are mostly unregulated and consumers have no guarantee the company issuing the currency has appropriate reserves or they will stay secure.

I see crypto.com offering 10% returns on USD Coin staked for 3 months. Supposedly they can give these insane returns because they are loaning your crypto to institutional and retail investors. My concern is what happens if we have a major downturn in the market. A lot of people are over leveraged so what happens when mass amounts of people cant pay back their loans?

Lets also consider groups like Tether who have been heavily questioned about the legitimacy of their reserves. This seems to be a massive storm brewing that I know Im not the first person to highlight. Add this to the mix and it seems total disaster would be certain.

This almost seems to good to be true. Are 10% yields on fixed-term deposits really zero risk?

TLDR: I want to invest in a stable coin yielding 10%. What are the risks for doing this? Could I potentially lose all my investment?

Can decentralized cloud compete with AWS, Microsoft, etc in terms of price, speed, and reliability? Decentralization is fantastic but I can't help  but feel it would be inefficient compared to the current market giants?

Logically  speaking, if I am looking to host my app, I am far more concerned about these 3 metrics than I am just being decentralized.

Decentralization would be more important to businesses that aren't accepted at most centralized hosting providers. But, I assume the vast majority of businesses have no issue complying with the rules of centralized hosting providers.

If there is anyone out  there with experience in hosting/networks that could chime in, that would be great. I am just looking to better understand these cryptos.

Logj4 and Java are ubiquitous in many industries such as banking, financial, and even cryptocurrency. This is a big, big deal, and if exploited can potentially be one of the worst exploits in history. As Java is a bytecode interpreted language, essentially an attacker can inject new bytecode into the JVM runtime which will subsequently be executed. Executing remote code can allow an attacker to steal personally identifiable/sensitive information. Be weary of your crypto investments, API keys, what exchanges you are using, and any applications you are using on your electronic devices that have access to your crypto investments.

Hey guys great news Bitcoin could hit 100k or, 500k, or even 1million in the next 30 minutes. If your single and lonely there's a chance that an attractive woman who's been obsessing over making a baby with you could just randomly show up at your doorstep. Also there's a chance that within the next 24hrs the McDonald's down the street from you could bring back the Mc Rib.

I base all these predictions on this guy who is on Twitter calling himself "neo". That's an obvious reference to the matrix and as we all know people that watch the Matrix are super smart. Anyway I'm off on my yacht right now doing some cocaine but when I come back in sure Bitcoin will be worth like 100 trillion billion dollars. Murrrica, I farted so long internet's.

Pepsi recently announced their mic drop NFTs and meta was welcoming. We obviously need a drink in the metaverse and Pepsi did it first. Idk why theyre mic drop though 

On Twitter Pepsi wrote The NFTs are basically free but you gotta pay for the gas to mint NFTs directly into your MetaMask or any such trusted wallet and to which Solana Twitter replied shoulda stuck to making sugar water. Check it in the image 

Its pretty obvious though, on which network the big NFTs are gonna be. But this made me laugh instantly

Let me preface this essay by saying that the majority of art NFTs are stupid. They are mostly worthless art done in a relatively rudimentary fashion that does not take advantage of the digital medium in which they are presented. For example, if I went to a gallery in which 3D printed ceramics were being made and they all looked as though they were thrown on a pottery wheel, would it really be that special? Of course not, which is why 3D printed ceramics typically explore forms that are impossible to throw on a wheel. This shows the viewer a blend of technology based design with a traditional practice, thus developing a new category of art. 

As for art NFTs, quite a few of them are likely used for money laundering. However, many physical pieces of art are also used for laundering money, so this in itself cannot be used as an argument against the value of NFTs. In fact, dismissing NFTs entirely based upon this idea, is very similar to Charlie Munger saying that he will not invest in crypto because it is used by criminals. There are many studies that discuss how crime is funded more by fiat than BTC. Why would Munger be arguing against crypto using flawed logic? It is because he is afraid of a changing financial landscape that he is unfamiliar and uncomfortable with. That is fair on an emotional and human level, but it is also illogical, which is detrimental in investing.

One thing that the blockchain excels with is providing opportunity to people in new spaces that they otherwise would not have, such as investing, decentralized finance, liquidity pools and art collecting. With this new opportunity comes an enormous learning curve for those who have little-to-no previous experience with the subtly complex workings of these industries. For example, why would anyone buy a Cryptopunk for $10M USD when you can just take a screenshot of the image and make it your profile picture? One might buy a Cryptopunk for the same reason that another person might prefer to own the original Starry Night as opposed to buying a full scale print from a street vendor. One is an authenticated piece of work that can be traced back to the artist who created it, while the other is a replicate. They can both aesthetically pleasing and carry the same emotional weight to the viewer. However, one was created by Van Gogh, while the other was not.

This leads us more directly to NFTs and brings up the question, what makes Cryptopunks so valuable? Cryptopunks are the first NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain. They are the standard for ERC-721 NFTs and serve as an inspiration for the modern crypto art movement. This inspiration stems from their artistically interesting innovation based upon their conceptual point of view, regardless of the viewers opinions on their aesthetic qualities. 

Cryptopunks are conceptual art as described by Sol Lewitts Sentence on Conceptual Art because they take a concept, which at times seems irrational, and explore it fully. The concept is a standard kit of digital parts that can be used in combination to make a large variety of similar pieces that form a set. The 10,000 punks were algorithmically generated using code based on standard parts each with their own rarity. 

Next, Cryptopunks are created without influence from the two artists (John Watkinson and Matt Hall) after their concept was created. This is due to the artists removal from the process the moment they allowed the code to generate the Punks forms. From a conceptual art point of view, this follows sentence 6 from Sol Lewitts Sentences on Conceptual Art which states, If (an) artist changes (their) mind midway through the execution of the piece (they) compromise the result and repeat past results. 

I like to think that Sol Lewitt would appreciate Cryptopunks, if not for their aesthetic value, then for their conceptual innovation in the evolving world of digital art. After all he liked to explore the cube in his works because in his own words, The most interesting characteristic of the cube is that it is relatively uninteresting. Lewitts work with cubes demonstrates the fact that the units involved in a work of art need not be the most interesting because the combination of the units is what creates the art. 

Prominent NFT projects that follow Cryptopunks tend to follow the conceptual blueprint laid out by John Watkinson and Matt Hall. These projects include the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Rabbitars, and Loaded Lions among many others. None of these projects elaborates on the conceptual innovation brought forth by Cryptopunks, however, they allow a wider audience to join the NFT space based upon their various aesthetic qualities, prices, and availability. Why would anyone want to own one of these NFTs that are essentially knocking off the concept of Cryptopunks? To use another physical art analogy, one might prefer the impressionist art of Claude Monet and another might prefer the art of Edouard Manet. The aesthetic qualities and the values of the pieces from the two artists might play an important role in why one art collector would prefer one artist over the other.

To conclude, NFTs are an emerging innovation in both the art and technology world. Many people are both confused by high prices and the simplicity of replication and believe NFTs can only be used as a means for money laundering. Art collecting has never been an affordable hobby, however, the internet and blockchain make it more visible to the average person. If a work of art is not aesthetically pleasing to one viewer, it does not mean that the art is bad or worthless.

TLDR: Cryptopunks go brrr but maybe they arent meant for you because of aesthetics and/or price, which is no different than any other piece of art ever made.

A new coinbase learn and earn is out. Who does not love some free crypto!

It is the Quant token (QNT). I dont know if it was already out for a longer time, but now Europe can participate as well. The answers are:
Overledger OS
Overledger network
All of the above

I do not know if the exchange flair is the correct one, otherwise I hope I can change it later. I have been lurking this sub for a while and now I think I have finally accumulated enough karma to post. 
Enjoy and happy holidays!

Ill start: Entered at close-to-ATH during the last bull a few years ago, and had planned to sell everything after meeting my price targets.

After everything dropped like the New Years ball, I rethought my plan and have been DCAing and ever since. Having spent a while learning about crypto and its impact on the future of finance, I cant ever imagine not owning crypto, so the idea of selling everything for cash is out the window. 

Im really interested to know if anyone else on here has a similar story?

Someone commented on a crypto sob story when investing in crypto, always be ready to lose everything you put in and that was a very real and realistic comment. Always out yourself in the worst scenario. Losing money is one thing.

Crypto can be very profitable in the long term if you know what to invest in. Things like Futures trading will leave you broke.

Try something like staking from DeFi platforms like ALGO and Yearn and get some governance tokens as well to be able to vote for decisions. Some DAOs like BitDAO have very powerful governance tokens since theyre backed by the biggest treasury in all of the crypto space.

But losing rent and food money is another. Never put yourself in this situation. Never put yourself in situations like that

Obviously no one knows, but I would like to hear everyone's opinion. So, tomorrow they are releasing the inflation data, and I think it will be on the higher side. Normally I would think crypto responds well to inflation, but I think it's going to trigger a sell off in this scenario. Also, this coming Tuesday, the fed will meet to discuss plans for interest rates and tapering the printing of money. These all seem so bearish to me and I think equities/crypto are going to suffer quite a lot. I'm considering moving to fiat tonight and then buying back in after these dips. What do you guys think?

So this is always been a topic of debate whether we are early or not.In terms of price of a coin nobody can actually guess where we are at but when you look at this in terms of number of people invested or holding Crypto, use Crypto We Are Early. 

The total population of world is over 7 billion and the number of Crypto investors, Holders is approx 120 million (Economic times survey as of August, 2021)
This could be a guess,not exactly the correct number but still it gives a rough idea, it is just 17% people in whole world invested in Crypto. 

With the economic situations in almost all the countries after Covid, expect this number to rise in coming years.And I am talking about Common folks like you and me. 
Given the rising economic problems,People will always look for something on their side to have a fighting chance.

It is just matter of time when they will realize that centralized monetary system is rigged.


TL:DR - You are Early than the Every single person starting to invest in Crypto tomorrow!

Recently I've seen way too many posts on this sub saying one thing. Do you anyone ever got rich with this mindset? It isn't 2011 anymore, and you have to start thinking with a different mindset.

Just because DOGE exploded doesn't mean that a bear market is likely around the corner or likely nog around the corner. Stop chasing. 

So much FUD being spread, and I know we're all sick of it. Same with shilling. Your shitcoin isn't going anywhere, but don't lose your bag to the whales (*they* want you to). 

DYOR and choose projects that are good over the long term with short term gains. Don't expect 100x returns - its 2022 soon which means 1000x returns (and a bear market). 

I know this post is going to be unpopular but it had to be said.

Ok, I havent seen any posts about privacy coins in the sub since Ive being here. 
How valuable and important do you think they are now and will be in the future?

I honestly believe them to be critical as we shift to integrate internet money into our lives. The ability to send value without the need to show everyone how much money you have and every past transaction youve made. With that been said it would seem that the market cap for privacy coin are much lower than you would expect relative to the market.

Do you think that society just doesnt value the benefits they offer or are we simply too early for people to care?

The bill islisted on the parliamentary agendafor the current winter session but has yet to be called for discussion. The details have not been made public yet but experts and VC investors along with journalists have come up with some details.
According to the Reuters report, the bill will impose a general prohibition on all activities by any individual on mining, generating, holding, selling, (or) dealing in virtual currencies as a medium of exchange, store of value and a unit of account  all characteristic of any legal tender.
Moreover, violating these rules will be treated as a cognizable offense, meaning that violators can be arrested without a warrant and held without bail. Other offenses categorized as cognizable crimes in India include murder, kidnapping and dowry death, among others.
Accoridng to a report by NDTV (One of the leading Indian News channels) the bill proposes fine upto $2.65million and jail time upto 1.5 years. Thats a massive amount given that average Indian makes less then 1000$ per annum.
The crypto bill will regulate crypto exchanges but will outlaw crypto wallets. So Indians will have to hold all of their crypto assets on Central exchanges. This is the biggest fuckup in the bill as it will make Indians speculative traders and non participants in the broader blockchain ecosystem like DeFi , gaming , swapping , liquidity farming and future innovations that are to come!
If no payments are allowed at all and an exception is not made for transaction fee then it will also effectively stop blockchain development and NFT.

I have always had this question in my mind, how does a team get paid?
Like where does the money come from?
I'm talking about all the team, the developers, the marketing team etc etc.

For instances, there are developers that have a wallet containing their crypto, a couple of thousands of something.

Or there are developers that don't have any of it.

With both this options is not conclusive to me how do they get paid, what pays for their monthly wager or yearly wager.

Even if they have thousand of their crypto, they would need to sell to have the money, therefore lowering the price in the process (if it's high amounts), so how do they manage?

I have had the app and an account with them for half a year or so now, Ive always been logged in and never log out so naturally because of this I had forgotten my password and i needed my password because I seen they deal with NFTs now and I wanted to check it out but you need to sign in through a browser and not the app itself so I was not logged in to the browser site. So I do the typically forgotten password and did not receive an email, so I periodically have been redoing the process and never get an email, so I email two different support/contact emails to help me change my password and no response. I tried calling, no response. After doing some research Ive learned that crypto.com could possibly be a scam even though its a well known and popular app because countless people possibly 1000 people I seen online are having issues along with their cryptos being missing, the non existent customer service, transferring crypto and it just goes missing. I guess even closing your account is the worst thing ever. Im trying to find a more reliable place to trade all cryptos. If they had customer service and actually emailed you important stuff Id stay with them but its not looking so great. Anyone having issues? Check to see if youre able to change your password.

A couple days back I was trying to transfer some money from
binance to kucoin. So i did the usual and i converted everything to
XLM but unfortunately the wallet was congested(idk maybe it had a
cold or something). So i converted everything to LRC and was trying
to transfer it and i saw the fee, lo and behold it was a disgusting 16 LRCs. I thought LRC was supposed to be "feeless" why tf was i about to pay this much money for transferring 30$? (i usually transfer a small amount to any wallet first before transferring the whole amount). 
Luckily i remembered that XRP has low fees and i converted it to that that and used it instead. But it still bothered me, so does anyone know why it's like that? Did i misunderstand how LRC actually worked? Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Idk maybe it's binance or maybe it's like that everywhere(l'll check coinbase). Does binance have "hidden" fees for certain tokens, or is it something that i'm missing?(probably something I'm missing)
